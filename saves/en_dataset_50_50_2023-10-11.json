    "answers": {
      "1": "I‚Äôm an apocalyptic by nature. I‚Äôve been expecting the end of the world for my entire life.\nBecause of that, I have been adhering to a strict drug consumption regimen to keep my mind nice and limber.\nIt helps that I was raised by a Marine. I don‚Äôt need to plan‚ÄîI can IMPROVISE.",
      "2": "Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass good bye. Not to worry, if it happens, you will never know it because you will be vaporized almost immediately.",
      "3": "Walk towards the light. Given the various unpleasant forms of lingering death after the nukes hit a quick momentary incineration is a blessing.",
      "4": "I make two phone calls. I make sure my children know that they were the best things I've ever done. That if they know nothing else in the world that they know how proud I was to love them every single second of their lives. That if they have to die then I want my final ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù in their ears when it happens.",
      "5": "Pray you're one of the survivors or for a quick death, the choice of which is yours.",
      "6": "Preferably drink and pretend like it‚Äôs not going to happen.\nAnd I will be very successful at both of these objectives, as there‚Äôs literally zero reason for governments around the world to tell most people that a nuclear hit is inbound until it‚Äôs absolutely certain. Depending on your geography this will be easier to tell or not at all. Nobody wants to deal with streets packed with panicked people, and no country on Earth has a legitimate evacuation policy as evacuation policies were deemed impossible ever since the 1970s.\nIn my native Sydney, I‚Äôll be able to get roughly an additional 4~6 minutes of drinking in after notification from the federal government. Assuming an ICBM.\nYour mileage may vary in between having minutes to seconds, depending on the extent of which governments have predicated to the importance of only issuing alerts when absolutely certain‚ÄîAnd by what and where you‚Äôre hit from. The biggest problem is that you might not get hit once, nor get hit within a small timeframe, or get hit multiple times for redundancy.\nSo you can‚Äôt really plan at all, to begin with.\nTo be fair, all the warning signs will already be apparent‚ÄîSuspicious movement of personnel, movement of fire engines away from likely hit zones, military personnel and materiel, stockpiling and distributing supplies, and possibly hours or days of aggressive rhetoric and speculations about a strategic nuclear exchange between multiple nations.\nNow, someplace like Sydney being hit is speculative and highly dependent on the evolving nature of this hypothetical war.\nRealistically speaking, it has few targets worth being hit as for strategic effect‚ÄîBut I reckon there‚Äôs a good argument that nuclear war won‚Äôt merely look like a laundry list of most to least likely strategic targets deserving nuclear hits in varying degrees. Rather there might be a ‚Äògradual escalation‚Äô where a nuclear power may strike out of the blue a place like Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, etc ‚Ä¶\nThe idea being that you strike first against a single allied, non-nuclear armed state‚Äôs population centre, and use that as an expression of political intent and seeing if another allied state might blink in the face of that rapid and sudden display of power.\nThe biggest risk of this is that it requires insane speed and forward power projection, the attack has to come literally out of the blue, that your foreign ministry have prepared statements and stances to maximize the intimidation of your government officials as soon as it happens‚ÄîAnd that literally whatever state about to be nuked, or their allies, don‚Äôt discover all of this planning and positioning well before the attack to reiterate their insistence that any nuclear exchange will be reciprocated by allied states.\nOr worse still, negated before it can happen.\nSimply put‚Ä¶\nI don‚Äôt know what I would do.\nPreferably drink and ignore it.",
      "7": "A nuclear war has been ‚Äúcoming‚Äù ever since Russians made their first atomic bombs to threaten the West. Your suggestion is nothing new.\nI‚Äôd suggest that the study of history would help preclude a lot of fairly embarrassing questions.",
      "8": "Nothing. I‚Äôm 75 and have no desire to live in a post-apocalyptic world.",
      "9": "Turn my back to the blast, curl up in a ball, put my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye",
      "10": "Get close to a target, life is hard enough now, I don‚Äôt want to live in a post nuclear war landscape.",
      "11": "After spending parts of three decades flying B-52s and B-1Bs, I know where the targets are.\nI retired to a place that is far away from them‚Ä¶",
      "12": "I get a nice bottle of Cognac. Haven‚Äôt had one in 50 years.",
      "13": "I live in a primary target area so I‚Äôm done for either way. It takes 30 minutes for the warheads to be delivered. I will sit and wait for the inevitable.",
      "14": "I‚Äôd die. I live in an area that has two big airports within ten miles and many manufacturing plants. If this area isn‚Äôt first strike target, it‚Äôs second. We‚Äôd be vaporized quickly.\nA big IF, if we weren‚Äôt directly hit an enemy would detonate a device a few miles over us. This would wipe out all electronics. We‚Äôd die slower.\nFor some insight about post nuclear war read the book ‚ÄúOne Second After‚Äù - William R. Forstchen.\nOr an older one, ‚ÄúAlas Babylon‚Äù - Pat Frank.\nBoth are good reads.",
      "15": "There‚Äôs not a lot you can do if it happens. I can remember being a child in the 60‚Äôs during the Cold War. The schools would have drills, similar to fire drills, where the teacher would have us students sit under our desks with our heads down and our hands over our heads. Like that was going to protect us from a nuclear blast. Some people built shelters back then when fears were high but I doubt anyone has them now. Basements may add some protection but that is doubtful. The best thing we can do is hope it never happens.",
      "16": "K.Y.A.G.B.",
      "17": "Dig a hole in the back garden. Jump in and cover yourself with leaves. It won‚Äôt protect you but it will leave the place looking tidier.",
      "18": "Prepare to kiss my arse goodbye and party like it‚Äôs 1999. There will be No beauty left in the world to savor. Nothing but smoking, radiated ruins as far as the eye can see. I‚Äôm not existing in That mad max hellscape, to which You are welcomed. There are bunker builders who are capitalizing on this latest fear trend. They build really beautiful ones. Vivos and Atlas(?) builders based out of CA. They offer pretty nice digs complete with all safety features: Air, water filtration systems are top notch. The US congress already has Their bunker spot. Underneath the Greenbriar hotel in/near the Smoky Mountains. All ready and waiting to protect these people from the destruction They implemented. Let‚Äôs see just How long They can hunker in their bunkers..before They feel ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô. üòÑü§£üòÜ",
      "19": "How big a war? Local tactical or global strategic?\nLocal tactical-do the fallout shelter thing, wait out the fallout and once it dissipates sufficiently get out of the radioactive zone fast.\nGlobal Strategic-enjoy the light show.",
      "20": "Park next door to the most likely first target. It will not be worth surviving so going quickly in the first blast would be the best option.",
      "21": "Pull my family close. Let them know that I love them and that they are the reason that these last years have been the happiest I've ever known\nSince they're Catholic, I'm sure praying will be involved. Since we're in the Philippines and haven't the funds to escape if it's with China, there's not much else to do.\nBesides‚Ä¶escape to where?",
      "22": "Get nuked, but take solace and in the fact that whoever started it will also have their country nuked, it‚Äôs MAD.",
      "23": "Nothing, except party with my friends and family. If I‚Äôm going to die, I‚Äôll do it my way.",
      "24": "Buy a couple more boxes of ammunition with the realization if anything happens I will be either be able to upgrade and pick up a firearm or two here and there or I won't be able to. Anything else is going to be semi random and only people with a larger organization will be able to keep and hold food. If you're wondering where law enforcement and the army went. All the large concentrations of the military will receive a hit by a nuclear weapon. This will be a attempt not for invasion but is a serious attempt to reduce the size of the army and keep the United States from becoming organized. What's left of the military and the police will be drawn back to reinforce areas that the government thinks they can hold. This will leave us as the people they are protecting them from and the people that will get no resources or food. Areas that the United States government will attempt to hold will probably surround nuclear reactor sites. These areas will probably be the only ones to receive electricity. Their size will be directly related to the amount of police and military they have and the available routes that they have open for travel this will be very vital as air travel and railroads will be strictly curtailed and probably unobtainable. . Initially there will be somebody from the local government to come by to inventory and take surplus food, without support from the government these groups will probably change, and people with disease that need medication will be triaged and most of the elderly will be put on a minimal assistance list. If you are one of the lucky ones that are in a government protected enclave congratulations. If you are one of the them that are being protected from by armed military personnel you will receive very limited assistance that will soon grow into none. Ask for things quickly the longer it takes the less possibility you will have to receive anything.",
      "25": "I don‚Äôt worry about it, because there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. If it comes, it comes. If not, I go on living my life.",
      "26": "5th point of contact insertion. Shove your head up your ass and kiss it goodbye if within 50 miles of blast. You most likely will survive the blast unscathed. However, the aftermath of logistics and panic will substantially lower your survival chances. Unless you are a prepper like a lot of us that prepare for when SHTF.",
      "27": "Call in sick, permanently. Take all my cash out the bank. Sell all of my worldly assets. Take out as many loans and as much credit as possible. Have a jolly nice time.",
      "28": "Die. With any luck if it happens, it‚Äôll happen when I‚Äôm at work (in a major city) so I check out instantly. If I‚Äôm unlucky it‚Äôll be a weekend when I tend to be well away from population centers. Then I have a long slow lingering death from radiation poisoning. Should I somehow miraculously survive the first 90 days of radiation, the marauding starving gangs will kill me, most likely. That or the second wave of nukes from submarines lurking off the coasts waiting for survivors to re emerge a few months after the initial attack.\nBest to be under a nuke when it goes off in a global war.",
      "29": "Nothing i dont do now.i dont think there would be much of life after anyway! Radiation would surely finish any survivors off .not a nice way to go.",
      "30": "Get drunk and have a laugh. I‚Äôm going to die anyway so might as well be happy about it.",
      "31": "Nuclear war could take the form of tactical nukes which have lower yields, i.e kilotons vs. megatons. Still, while not as dirty or devastating, the decontamination, cleanup, and rebuilding would be considerable. It‚Äôs something to be avoided.\nAnd of course it could escalate to Armageddon. Let‚Äôs not go there at all.\nWhat do I do? Find a fallout shelter. Otherwise stockpile canned goods and water. Stay indoors preferably in a basement. Seal up windows if possible, but if a strike is imminent, don‚Äôt be anywhere near a window. Try to be under something that is very sturdy. Surround your nook with dense materials.\nHope that you‚Äôre lucky.",
      "32": "Not worried about it.\nI am comfortable with the fact that the country that starts it will suffer most.",
      "33": "There is a medical intervention that was recommended by John Campbell, a YouTube pandemic nurse. I think that it involves taking tourine and iodine, and I would add hiding in an internal room in the house.\nThen I would pray that the nukes failed to launch.",
      "34": "Nothing. As a long time disaster planning and response professional I have whatever might be needed to survive a limited engagement if not to close to an actual strike, and I'm not located near any prime target areas. If I survive the initial effects, I am better equipped and suited than most to survive a good long time.",
      "35": "Tell my family I love them. Send a text or email to friends that are important, tell them the same thing. Gather as much of my family together but I can in one place. Sing, laugh, talk, wait. There is no surviving a nuclear war. Even if you do eventually radioactive dust will settle on you you will get sick and die. Let's pretend you have a multi-million dollar bunker. Fine. You are trapped in there until you die. It better be comfortable.",
      "36": "‚ÄúAssume that a nuclear war is coming. What do you do?‚Äù\nI already know.\nBack in the 1980‚Äôs, while Reagan was saying a nuclear war wouldn‚Äôt be all that bad, I came home from work one day, turned on the TV, just as a Special Bulletin message appeared on the screen.\nThen a somewhat frightened looking announcer came on, saying that a launch of Soviet missiles had been detected.\nI stood in a state of shock for a moment, looking around my house, realizing that this was the last thing I would experience.\nThen I turned back and was confused to see a new scene behind the announcer, which was an obvious news-show-crafted sign saying ‚ÄúThe Big One Is Here.‚Äù Very slowly my pulse slowed down as I realized that this was a comedy show, not a real broadcast.\nBut for that moment I did think it was real, I learned exactly what I would do.\nNothing, because there would be nothing I could do.",
      "37": "Move to somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere as isolated as possible but with reliable access to clean water and some kind of food supply.",
      "38": "Drive as quickly as possible to the nearest target city.. Get as close to the blast as possible. I don't want to be around for what's left. That would be a lot of social chaos, radiation sickness, starvation, lack of medical care, a very sick and damaged natural world... Pedal to the metal. Some of the natural world would survive, I think, and would eventually recreate itself in amazing ways. I think some of humanity would survive and rebuild. I'm not interested in trying to survive in a wrecked world.",
      "39": "Well going to church is out. That pray thing does not work.\nBuy enough booze to get a shipload of sailors drunk and have at it. I am 64 and single so screwing myself stupid is out but then again the much younger lady next door is single.\nI am a happy drunk without a worry in the world so just stay pissed.",
      "40": "Well, I just do what I do everyday. Go to work, buy some food, cooking, cleaning my house and repeat until the nuclear war come and end my exist. Death is inevitable anyway.",
      "41": "Well, considering that by the time such a reality became CLEAR (And until the missiles are flying there is always hope that diplomacy could prevent that) and the location I live in (Let‚Äôs just say that my home is within an hour‚Äôs drive of MANY ‚ÄúFirst strike targets‚Äù) I would do nothing since it would be FAR too late to get out of there far enough to avoid the shock wave, actual blast, and fallout. The funny thing here is that I have lived in several regions in my life. ALL of them could be described this way, I have always been ‚Äúdoomed.‚Äù\nEven if I lived somewhere in the middle of nowhere in the central plains there would be no escaping the residual effects of such a war. Nuclear Winter would cause crops to fail, infrastructure would be too damaged to provide heat, electricity, clean water, and access to safe food. So chaos and anarchy would be the law of the land. Or at least it would be until everyone died from famine, untreatable disease, or radiation sickness.\nI think that I would actually be one of the lucky ones since I can pretty much guarantee that it would all be over in an INSTANT for anyone in this region‚Ä¶meanwhile, that post-apocalyptic hellscape would be worse than death in my mind.",
      "42": "There have been a lot of awnsers saying the blast is 2 minuts away or has been ready for 60 years. I think you are asking about if the blast may happen in the next day or two.\nI would fill the car with food, water and gasolien, then fill the truck with food and gasolein and water. O would also need a high qualtiy shelter of sorts, and som survival gear and a first aide kit. I would also pack a rifle, shotgun, a good amount of ammo for both, and a bottle of flinstones vitamens. FLINTSTONES!\nThey contain a substance called potasium iodide, this will protect several organs in the event of mid dose radiation exposure. Also if exposed to radiation, i will be suseptable to disease, vitamine A and C found in the vitamines will help with this.\nI would then bring as much of my family as could fit in the car with food and water for at least a week for all of them.\nI would drive to a minimum of 200 kilometeres feom any location hosting over 12 000 people. I would then stay there for until a month after the blast, i wil return to the city armed, there is a small chance that it is every man for himself and they will try to kill you so you dont use their precios drinking water.\nBut, more likely, the survivores will want help seting up a village on the outskirts of the city, treating the radiation victems, and gathering food and water, in withc case i will join there scociity.",
      "43": "SOMEONE ONCE ASKED EINSTEIN, ‚ÄúIS WWIII GOING TO BE FOUGHT WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS?‚Äù\nEINSTEIN RESPONDED, ‚ÄúI DON'T KNOW BUT WW4 WILL BE FOUGHT WITH STICKS AND ROCKS.‚Äù",
      "44": "You know what? Bring it. Maybe we‚Äôll learn to get along again. And if not, fuck it, I won‚Äôt be here.",
      "45": "Sit back and relax. My counter for this question is what can you do? Catch it? Sorry for being rude. But I'll sit with my family and talk about the good things and be happy. The world is already realy messed up. Hopefully, whoever survived this can make it a better place",
      "46": "I'll go to the subway. This will be the first reaction. Then I will rejoice: I did not have children by the age of 39. Then I'll die anyway."

    "answers": {
      "1": "Are you kidding? Support for Ukraine is one of the high marks for President Biden. As far as I can tell we still are at peace with Russia. As for our disagree with Russia, the fault lies with Mr. Putting in Russias illegal invasion of Ukraine.",
      "2": "Your hat fits you like a glove.",
      "3": "Poor little troll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶aren‚Äôt you bored by now?",
      "4": "As soon as the GOP apologizes for betraying the us by voting trump and supporting Russia's illegal war. But I doubt that will ever happen.",
      "5": "You‚Äôre doing exactly what your boss Putin told you to do. What a good little tool you are.",
      "6": "Great question, i‚Äôll personally apologize when you admit that you have untreated undiagnosed mental illness and you get it treated.",
      "7": "Comrade Anatroll Trolksky,\nDrones are raining on Moscow. I know you feel safe in your troll farm in St. Petersburg but stay away from windows just in case.\nOn the other hand, you might be more useful to Putin as cannon fodder in Donbas‚Ä¶",
      "8": "Well, for one, there‚Äôs nothing to apologize because there is no betrayal.\nWe haven‚Äôt had peace with Russia since Putin became leader, and that happened long before Biden was President.\nWe are NOT at war with Ukraine. We are supporting the country in its dispute with Russia,\nNo one is going to take you seriously if you don‚Äôt know basic world history.",
      "9": "British here.üá¨üáß The United States of America is not at war with Russia. They are supplying Ukraine with weapons which is perfectly legal. Russia has been arming countries and warlords since World War Two and nobody has suggested that by selling weapons they are at war with the opposing side they are selling to. Russia is at peace with China and North Korea for as long as they choose to but I think you need to know Russia under Putin has an agenda, to reinstate the Soviet empire. A lot of countries are giving weapons to Ukraine, and my country has been training Ukrainian forces for over eight years. We have been supplying them with weapons for that long as well, but that doesn't mean we are at war with Russia. Ask yourself how many and which countries have been supplied with Russian weapons. The AK47 has been exported all over the world. The United States aren't new to supplying weapons either. Neither country is at war with the other. The United States supplied the Mujahedeen when they were fighting Russia but the United States wasn't at war with Russia.",
      "10": "From Europe, where the war is actually happening, because of Putin's desire to recreate the USSR, your comments just convinced a few more people that American Conservatives really are too stupid to be let out on their own.",
      "11": "You‚Äôre really too dumb to even have internet access.",
      "12": "I‚Äôm not a Democrat or a liberal by any extent of the imagination. But I honestly feel ashamed for brave and decent Americans who voted against a Cheeto with the brainpower of an expired jug of milk who have to put up with comments like these. Firstly, peace with Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia is equivalent to betraying those in Georgia, Ukraine and so many other nations who are ACTIVELY FIGHTING FOR THEIR COUNTRY just like your ancestors might have fought the British Army in the late 18th century for the freedom of the United States. Secondly, the United States and NATO are not at war with the Russian Federation. They are enacting an embargo upon said Federation so as to support Ukraine and take down the absolute despots that Putin and the oligarchs have become. Lastly, I don‚Äôt support Biden, I think he is a weak president, but he is much better than men like Trump, DeSantis or McConnell whose only goals are to ruin the United States for anybody who is not a cisgender, white, christian, ethnically English man with no disabilities. –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ .",
      "13": "And Trump would avoid war by appeasing Putin by selling out Ukraine just like Anthony Eden prevented WWII by appeasing Hitler by selling out Czechoslovakia and Poland. Oh wait! That just encouraged Hitler and assured WWII. I forgot for a second. Apparently you forgot for a lot longer than that.",
      "14": "Ashamed? If I voted for your trained orangutan I would have cause for shame. I waited 2 decades for Joe Biden to become president. I'M PROUD OF MY VOTE FOR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN! ( By the way the so called peace with Russia was proof that trump was Putin's puppy!)",
      "15": "Your ‚Äúpeace with Russia‚Äù involved your President Donald Trump locking himself away in a room with Vladimir Putin to discuss issues of such importance that the world never has found out what was talked about there. Knowing what we know now about Trump‚Äôs attitude to Top Secret documents, how sure are you that your President wasn‚Äôt selling out the whole country to the Russians? Selling out all of her allies too? It doesn‚Äôt seem like a mistake to put a short, sharp stop that that kind of treason.",
      "16": "If your going to start kissing republicant ass there‚Äôs a whole other app for that‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs called X and it‚Äôs run by an asshole who is a white supremacist he‚Äôll make you feel at home. In the meantime get the hell off quora fucking LOSER!",

      "18": "When that actually happens. We saved the USA by doing so. Retrumplican filth are the ones who betrayed America by voting against Biden. We took this country from tension with Russia to saving Ukraine from Russia. Your kind made the mistake and can't face it. You have Biden Derangement Syndrome",
      "19": "So you're a pussy who wants to suck up to Russia, are you? Its a Disgrace that people who present themselves as Republicans feel that way. Reagan would be turning over in his grave. And I will never apologize for voting against antiwar cowards, and Populist demagogues, who pander to white trash. Never.",
      "20": "DA, the United States is not at war in Ukraine, with Russia, or, at present, anywhere else. Get a grip on reality, will ya.",
      "21": "When are Democrats and liberals going to apologize for betraying the U.S. by voting for Biden and taking this country from peace with Russia to a war in Ukraine? Are they too ashamed of their mistake and afraid to face it?\nWhen are Right-wingers going to start blaming the war on the guy who sent in the troops?\nBiden is doing a fine job. We‚Äôre not apologizing for a damned thing.",
      "22": "I think they‚Äôre just more likely to fact check. The U.S. is not at war with anyone for the first time in over 20 years.",
      "23": "Why? The alternative was a traitorous sponeless coward and fje most corrupt president of all time. id rather we support yhe ukrainr then the sniveling support of russia trump would offer.",
      "24": "We are still not at war with Russia, comrade. But that is entirely up to them. Peace is predicated on us capitulation to their take over of Europe. That is something I am not willing to do. Though I know you feel differently, comrade",
      "25": "When are Republicans going to realize that if they pull collective their heads out of their asses that what they are doing is trying to destroy the USA?",
      "26": "You Can not blame the war on Biden and the Democrats. Trump had zero control over anything in Russia. No one controls what Russia does except Putin. And Putin had been building up to invasion for years. Including during Trump‚Äôs Presidency. Get some perspective.",
      "27": "The more appropriate question is when will Trump supporters apologize for turning their back on their country. The US built the world system they now condemn; totally overlooking the fact that the global system was built by ‚Äúthe greatest generation‚Äù of whom they speak so highly. The global system has fed and clothed them, and kept them safe their entire lives and now they propose to destroy it for reasons they cannot articulate. They further betrayed our nation by demanding we appease Russia so the Russians will be nice‚Ä¶ another lesson from ‚Äúthe greatest generation‚Äù they've chosen to ignore. They're demanding that NATO be disbanded, that we become isolationist, that we end free trade, that we not participate in the globalist system we created and that our enemies want‚Ä¶ in other words, they want to do everything our enemies want, guaranteeing that America will crumble.\nWhat they don't see is that all of their demands come from the far radical Left that they claim to despise. If they were honest and unafraid, they'd realize they elected a man who spent his life with the radical left, destroyed the Republican party, destroyed real patriotism, and should he ever have his way - cause the definative downfall of the United States.\nHowever, I don't see Trumpers ever apologizing, for they have no shame. And they are simply too ignorant to realize that globalization will exist with or without us - and that our vacancy from the world only guarantees the ascension of another power, leaving us behind.\nDo they know what made ‚Äúthe greatest generation‚Äù so great? It was simply this: history threw down a gauntlet to the world, and that generation of Americans chose to pick it up. Through blood and fire they won America's place in history. History abhors a vacuum, and if Trump and his minions want to walk away, they are walking away from the greatest victory ever achieved, earned by blood.\nWhat did you think? That others wouldn't want what we have? That it would be easy to hold history? What do you think Russia is doing? Do you believe they are simply bored? No wait - Trumpian dolts believe that NATO is threatening Russia - despite never having done so in more than 70 years. Or perhaps they believe that Russia is ending Ukrainian corruption, or bio labs, or, or, or‚Ä¶\nOr perhaps Trump and his followers have minds of children and hearts of cowards. Perhaps it Trump and followers that threaten us all and they are too dishonorable to admit it.\nTo hold our place in history requires a kind of courage Trump and his followers simply do not have‚Ä¶\nTo walk away from our task, to walk away from history is a betrayal to that great generation, indeed, a betrayal to us all.",
      "28": "I‚Äôm not ashamed of anything.\nIf you are an American, I am disgusted by your lying propaganda for the political right, which wants to rip you off, and lies to you that they act in your best interest.\nIf you are not an American, what you say is irrelevant.",
      "29": "When are Republicans and the GOP going to apologize for betraying the US by voting for a man who utterly violated his oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution (not to mention seriously compromised our national security)? Are they too brainwashed, or just too unintelligent, to even realize their mistake?",
      "30": "What I don't understand is why the Trump family wasn't prosecuted for using the White House for their personal gain.\nHow Trump fused his business empire to the presidency\nAs Trump kicks off his fourth year as president with an impeachment trial tied to his actions involving Ukraine, critics say the president has yet to face accountability for blatant conflicts of interest tied to his private businesses.\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/20/trump-businesses-empire-tied-presidency-100496",
      "31": "When are Democrats and liberals going to apologize for betraying the U.S. by voting for Biden and taking this country from peace with Russia to a war in Ukraine?\nNever, after all we aren't war with Russia so we can't rightly apologize for getting into a war with Russia. Nor will we apologize for electing a competent politicians who radically improved the situation in a scant few months hitting records for recovery from the strife his predecessor created. Speaking of which when are you guys going to apologize for electing an incompetent jackass who got over a million of our citizens killed, nearly crashed the economy, and when he lost the election stole a bunch of government property in retaliation?\nAre they too ashamed of their mistake and afraid to face it?\nNaw, see theres no mistake to face. We did nothing wrong here nor did Joe Biden. Objectively providing military equipment to a friendly nation so they could resist sn illegal invasion was the right call. It costs us nothing being that all that equipment was paid for decades ago, hems in Russias aggression without us needing to go to war, and makes us look good for actually living up to our ideas of freedom for once.",

Trump is a criminal who should be in prison for the rest of his life. It beggars belief that he is allowed to run for President again. It is the Republicans who should be ashamed, very ashamed.",
      "45": "With the true people of the United States of America would probably do that if that's exactly what happened. However, that's not how things went down so, it's you who should apologize for voting for Trump!",

If Trump took Putin‚Äôs male member out of his mouth for long enough to give Ukraine the arms they needed, the ‚ÄòSpecial Military Operation‚Äô might never have happened. Without Trump‚Äôs weakness as POTUS and his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, Putin might never have been emboldened enough to attack Ukraine in the first place.",
      "48": "Rightly and righteously, they will never apologize for helping save free, peaceful, small-d democratic Ukraine and its valiant people from being eaten alive by a soul-less dictator who started an unprovoked and murderous and pointless war.

      "50": "I doubt that ‚ÄúDemocrats and liberals‚Äù believe that anyone else but Vladimir Putin is responsible for Vladimir Putin‚Äôs decision to invade Ukraine. Indeed, given what this invasiion reveals about the nature and character of Vladimir Putin, if it were true that Trump was so friendly to Putin that he felt he had no need to invade Ukraine because of that, it would be a failing on the part of Trump."

      "1": "A woman fleeing the burning buildings of her French town, which German troops had set afire during their retreat, c. 1944. While the Germans did not conduct a strict scorched-earth policy as they withdrew, they did carry out reprisals against perceived Resistance strongholds. On June 10, 1944, at Oradour-sur-Glane, France, SS troops killed 642 people, including 207 children, by herding them into buildings and setting fire to the entire village.\nAustralian Special Forces radio operator Leonard Siffleet about to be executed by a Japanese officer, Aitape Beach, Papua New Guinea, October 24, 1943. This photograph was reportedly recovered from the body of a dead Japanese officer.\nThe Matsuzakaya department store towering over the charred remnants of Toyko's Ginza district. The opening of the Matsuzakaya store in the 1920s signaled the emergence of the Ginza as Tokyo's most vibrant retail centre, and the building boasted a rooftop zoo and garden. The U.S. Army Air Forces firebombing campaign destroyed roughly one-fourth of the city and killed 100,000 people.\nUkrainian civilians being made to clear rubble and assist in the rebuilding of Kharkiv, Ukraine, U.S.S.R., following the recapture of the city by Nazi forces in March 1943. Kharkiv changed hands five times between the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and the end of the war.\nMonks searching the rubble of the abbey at Monte Cassino in Cassino, Italy, 1944. The ruined statue in the foreground is of St. Benedict of Nursia, founder of the Benedictine Order. Benedict established the monastery in 529, and since that time the abbey has been destroyed by warfare or earthquake at least four times. In February 1944 hundreds of Italian civilians were sheltering in the monastery when it was leveled by Allied bombers and artillery fire. Allied commanders had mistakenly believed that the Germans were using the abbey as a fortified observation post, and their error was a massive propaganda victory for the Nazis. Ironically, while German troops had not been a regular presence within the monastery while it stood, they were quick to occupy its ruins, which afforded excellent cover and lines of sight. It would take the Allies two months to dislodge the Germans from the superb defensive positions that they had unwittingly created.\nA scene from Nazi-occupied Krak√≥w, Poland, in late 1939. Jews were forced to ride in the rear of the streetcars, and the sign (right) reads ‚ÄúFor Jews‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor non-Jews‚Äù in both German and Polish. In December 1939 the German government decreed that all Jews had to wear white armbands displaying the Star of David. The woman seen at far left is wearing one of these armbands. Some 56,000 Jews lived in Krak√≥w prior to the German invasion of Poland, but by the end of the war fewer than one-tenth of that number remained.\nVidkun Quisling (centre) looking into a mass grave that contains the bodies of Norwegian resistance fighters, June 1945. The site, in Trandum Forest, northeast of Oslo, was the scene of mass shootings by the German authorities with whom Quisling was collaborating. Quisling was executed for treason on October 24, 1945.\nDevastation in the Nationalist Chinese capital of Nanjing (Nanking) in the wake of a Japanese bombing attack, November 1937. This destruction was only a precursor of what would come in the following weeks. The fall of the city to Japanese commander Matsui Iwane on December 13, 1937, would mark the beginning of the Nanjing Massacre. On Matsui's orders, Japanese troops carried out mass executions and raped tens of thousands of women. At least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 people were killed. After the war, Matsui was executed as a war criminal.\nAt the time of its original publication, early in World War II, this photo was captioned, ‚ÄúNazis Round up Population of a Russian City for Deportation to Germany. Photograph shows Russian men, women, and children receiving instructions from the Gestapo prior to their journey to Germany.‚Äù However, it is highly unlikely that reality followed this narrative. Nazi racial policy held that Slavs were inferior, and Hitler had little interest in filling the Fatherland with refugees from territories that his own armies had conquered. It is far more probable that the people in the image were among the roughly seven million Soviet civilians who were killed by the Nazis.\nMen, women, and children combing through the wreckage after German bombing raids in London, July 28, 1941. German air raids killed more than 40,000 British civilians during World War II, with Londoners constituting nearly half that total. German attacks on British cities‚Äîwith conventional aircraft as well as V-1 and V-2 rockets‚Äîwould continue through March 1945. By that point, the war's outcome had long since been decided, and Allied armies were converging on Berlin.\nPiles of emaciated corpses at the Nazi concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, Germany. The photo was taken following the British liberation of the camp on April 15, 1945. Anne Frank, the teenage diarist who chronicled her family's two years of hiding from the Gestapo, died of typhus at the camp shortly before the British arrived. In her diary she wrote, ‚ÄúI still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.‚Äù",

This marked the beginning of the German occupation of France that was to last 4 years.\n4/ Fleet Carrier USS Bunker Hill after being struck by kamikazes off Okinawa in 1945.

Thousands of American soldiers would be killed on that day.\n8/ Task Force 58: the greatest naval armada ever assembled and fought in history. The number of ships was so large that no one photo could capture the entire task force. A testament to the immense naval power of the United States.\n9/ B-29s flying near Mount Fuji in an air raid over Japan in 1945.\n10/ General Douglas MacArthur returning to the Philippines in 1944 with his retinue. By all accounts, this scene was staged several times until MacArthur was satisfied with the quality. This event happened against the backdrop of a savage campaign in the Philippines that would claim the lives of hundreds thousands of people, both civilians and military.",

      "10": "In the hospital in Wola, they organized a macabre party. Pregnant women were cut out of babies from their bellies and sewed cats and rats in their place with soldiers' twine. In the wounds of dying mothers, they extinguished cigarettes. Such was the sadism of the Germans during the Warsaw Uprising.\nThe sadism of the drunken henchmen from the unit of SS-Oberf√ºhrer Oskar Dirlewanger was terrifying even among the SS men. ‚Äì Mein F√ºhrer, they are real bastards! - Hermann Fegelein, Adolf's brother-in-law and a war criminal, reviewed Hitler's exploits of the Dirlewangerers. But a bunch of criminals in German uniforms were just following orders.\n- Rape, murder, burn and plunder. You can kill all civilians, Hitler ordered the soldiers who were pacifying Warsaw. In the first days of the Warsaw Uprising, in August 1944, the Germans brutally murdered up to 60,000 defenseless civilians in Warsaw's Wola district. Throughout Warsaw - three times as many.\nThey entered on Saturday, August 5, 1944. After taking over the hospital at ul. They raped all the nurses in Leszno. The last in line finished off the victims by jumping on each one's head. The children were impaled on a stick and roasted in a bonfire in the courtyard. This day will go down in history as \"Black Saturday\", one of the most tragic dates in the history of Warsaw.\nThe wetboys won't stop there. A day later, they will murder the charges of the Orthodox orphanage.\n‚ÄúWe blew up the door of one of the buildings. We saw a room full of children, all with their hands up. Dirlewanger, whom even his own people called the butcher, had them all killed. At the same time, he ordered to save ammunition and kill them with rifle butts. Blood flowed in streams down the stairs, Mathias Schenk, a Wehrmacht sapper, recalled years later.\nTo disguise the slaughter, the Dirlewangerers mixed the corpses of children with the corpses of adults. The bodies were stacked up to the second floor, poured with kerosene and set on fire. Only two girls survived the massacre. Shortly before the pyre was set on fire, they got out from under the heap of bloody bodies and ran away.\nWarsaw Uprising. A killing spree\nThe 36th SS Grenadier Regiment, Dirlewanger's subordinates, was a collection of criminals released from prisons and camps, a sort of penal battalion with the prospect of an amnesty for exemplary service. Many were imprisoned for poaching. The Nazi leadership decided that those experienced in tracking and killing forest animals would be able to deal with the \"bandits\" hiding in the forests in eastern Poland.\nThe commander himself came up with the devilish plan to create a unit of cutthroats. Oskar Dirlewanger was a thoroughly demoralized delinquent and a sadist. In the 1920s, he was convicted of raping a thirteen-year-old girl. He got out of prison quickly. He began to insistently fight for rehabilitation and reinstatement of his doctoral degree in political science, which he lost with the sentence. He regained it in 1940 thanks to the intercession of the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler, who was delighted with the idea of forming a unit of criminals.\nHis henchmen were given a safe-conduct to kill. They could do anything, provided they liquidated the anti-German resistance movement. Everywhere they went, they left piles of corpses. They surrounded villages suspected of supporting partisans, raped women, and then herded the inhabitants into barns and burned them alive. They razed several hundred villages to the ground and murdered 150,000 people.\nDrunk animals\nHearing about the outbreak of the uprising in Warsaw, Himmler summoned Dirlewanger's crooks. \"Black hunters\", as a French historian would call them years later, were to track down and eliminate the insurgents. It soon turned out that the Dirlewanger soldiers could not cope with the insurgents.\n‚ÄúThese troglodytes had no combat skills,‚Äù Herman G√∂ring, a member of the elite Luftwaffe division, who used civilians as human shields, recalled after the war: ‚ÄúI went out to Ch≈Çodna Street and through my binoculars I watched them being mowed down by Polish troops. These drunken animals were walking straight towards the insurgent barricade, they didn't even crouch, shooting blindly. They were dropping like flies,‚Äù he said.\nDirlewanger, however, did not care about losses. He motivated his subordinates by shooting stragglers in the back.\nA cut from the belly to the neck\nThe Dirlewangerers turned out to be useful only when civilians remained in Wola. They began to act in accordance with the new guidelines recommending saving scarce cartridges.\n‚ÄúDirlewanger's men came in. One took a woman. She was pretty, young. She didn't scream. He raped her, pressing her head hard against the table. In the other hand he had a bayonet. First, he cut off her blouse. Then one cut, from belly to neck. Blood gushed out - said 18-year-old Schenk about the seizure of the tenement house in Wola.\nChoristers, clergymen and seminarians living in the parish house at Wolska were murdered by the Dirlewanger soldiers by stabbing them with kitchen knives looted from the apartments of the murdered civilians. Others were herded into cellars or courtyards of tenement houses and there they threw grenades.\nDirlewanger patiently explained to his subordinates that in an enclosed, small space, the shock wave is ten times larger and tears everyone apart. Just two \"potato mashers\" - as German grenades with a shaft were called - were enough to kill up to fifty people.\nThe soldiers spared no one. ‚Äì That little girl ‚Äì recalled Schenk ‚Äì was thin and short, about 12 years old. Clothes torn, hair disheveled. She stood against the wall, not knowing where to run. She raised her hands, said: \"Ni≈õ partizani.\" I waved to her not to be afraid, to come over. She walked with her hands up.\nOne was clutching something. She was close, a shot was fired, her head snapped back. A piece of bread fell out of his hand. In the evening, a platoon leader approached me, he was from Berlin. \"Wasn't that a master shot?\" he smiled proudly.\nThe death of the beast\nOn the third day of the Wola massacre, a logistical problem arose. I didn't know what to do with the corpses. The Germans ran out of people to \"serve\" them. Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski took command of the forces of the Third Reich in Warsaw. He understood that the simultaneous extermination of the population and the conduct of combat operations were not an option.\nThe destruction of the millionth capital and the effective disposal of the bodies, so that they did not cause an epidemic in the middle of summer, would have to take many months, and the Soviets standing behind the Vistula River could strike at any moment. For this reason, on August 5, he banned the murder of women and children. The Dirlenwangers disobeyed von dem Bach's order - they murdered civilians for at least five more days, although with less intensity.\nDirlewanger was the only one who paid for these crimes. On June 1, 1945, French soldiers captured him when he tried to cross the border with Italy in plain clothes. He was taken to the Allied prison in Altshausen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. On the night of 4/5 June he was beaten to death with rifle butts. The self-judgment was most likely made by Poles who recognized the criminal.\nThe other two executioners of Warsaw ‚Äì Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski and Heinz Reinefarth ‚Äì escaped punishment. The Americans refused to extradite them to Poland.\n-------------------------------------------------\nGerman crimes in the Warsaw Uprising - mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war, attacks on undefended civilian objects, rape, displacement, looting, destruction of property and other serious violations of the law of war committed by German police and military units involved in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising .\nHistorians estimate that between 150,000 and 150,000 people died in August and September 1944. up to 180 thousand civilian residents of Warsaw, of which at least 63,000 outside combat operations. About 550,000 people were expelled. inhabitants of the capital and 100 thousand. people from towns near Warsaw, of which nearly 150,000 were taken to forced labor or concentration camps. As a result of the fighting in August and September 1944, as well as the systematic demolition and burning of the city in the following months by German destructive units, 55% of the pre-war buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.\nZbrodnie niemieckie w powstaniu warszawskim ‚Äì Wikipedia, wolna encyklopedia\nPolscy cywile zamordowani przez Niemc√≥w w czasie powstania warszawskiego , w egzekucji przy ul.

German guards moved them two stories down into a meat locker. When they came back to the surface, ‚Äúthe city was gone,‚Äù remembered writer Kurt Vonnegut, one of the American POWs who witnessed the bombing of Dresden.\nKurt Vonnegut - Wikipedia\nFamily and early life Edit Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born in Indianapolis on November 11, 1922, the youngest of three children of Kurt Vonnegut Sr. and his wife Edith (n√©e Lieber). His older siblings were Bernard (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917). He had descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his paternal great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut , settled in Indianapolis and founded the Vonnegut Hardware Company . His father and grandfather Bernard were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as Das Deutsche Haus (now called \"The Athen√¶um\"), the Indiana headquarters of the Bell Telephone Company , and the Fletcher Trust Building . [2] Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city with their fortune deriving from ownership of a successful brewery. [3] Both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, but the ill feeling toward Germany during and after World War I caused them to abandon German culture in order to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach Vonnegut to speak German or introduce him to German literature and traditions, leaving him feeling \"ignorant and rootless\". [4] [5] Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper during the first decade of his life, for raising him and giving him values; he said, \"she gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me\", and \"was as great an influence on me as anybody\". He described her as \"humane and wise\" and added that \"the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs\" came from her. [6] The financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts had once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers' brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of prohibition . When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce. [7] Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools , but Vonnegut was placed in a public school called Public School No. 43 (now the James Whitcomb Riley School). [8] He was bothered by the Great Depression, [a] and both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a \"dreamy artist\". [10] His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said that she expressed hatred for her husband that was \"as corrosive as hydrochloric acid \". [11] She unsuccessfully tried to sell short stories she had written to Collier's , The Saturday Evening Post , and other magazines.

The numbers of different types of tanks, many with no turret to give a longer barrel, and the troop carriers who looked terrifying in their Steele helmets.\nThere was a documentary on the history channel, which had me enjoy opera for the first time in my life. I found it again, after the segment on Africa, on, I believe, Scorched Earth, Season One Episode One. No computer tanks.\nI believe the Russians had much of an oath, very different from what the germans ran into at the start. One voice said, and the English translations were written‚Ä¶no communism. ‚ÄúI swear that I would rather die than surrender myself my family and my country to the Nazi invader‚Äù and then it was repeated. Then, the same voice, ‚Äúblood for blood‚Äù. it is repeated. ‚ÄúDeath for Death‚Äù. again repeated.

      "16": "Not this one, which currently appears in Jonathan Buttall‚Äôs answer to this question:\nThat‚Äôs a fake. Or to be more accurate, a work of art, created by an artist. You can read all about it on his website.:\nThe Making of Innocent Shadow\nI created Innocent Shadow using POV-Ray , a free ray-tracing program available for most platforms that can generate a wide range of images from text description files. This \"making of\" is broad overview of how I created the image. If you'd like to see how I modeled the objects in Innocent Shadow you can download the POV-Ray source text and images as a zip file . A sepia version is available at Zazzle . In elementary school I learned shadows were burned into stone and wood by the atomic bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The haunting images of people's shadows, recording the instant of their deaths, had a great impact on me. When I read the new IRTC stills topic, the idea of a nuclear shadow as a \"Frozen Moment\" came to me instantly. This was an early sketch showing my original concept, in which the shadows (of a father and son on a pier) are imprinted on the wall. Now you know why I use a computer to draw... This simple image was a position and perspective test, the father and son represented by cylinders. I knew I wanted to do a pipe wheel that was also shadowed by the blast, to give a hint to what the missing people's shadows meant. I wanted the full shadows to be visible, so I thought they needed to be above the base of the wall, and this was my solution. Another early concept I considered was a merry-go-round in a schoolyard playground. At this point I decided I didn't want to spend time away from the Venice image I'd been working on, so I dropped the project for several days. I later brought up the idea of a nuclear shadow as a frozen moment to a friend. She was so touched by the concept I decided to spend the time to create the image. I showed her my sketches and mentioned the idea of a girl frozen while jumping rope (a double frozen moment), and she liked that idea best. The first thing I did was pull up a picture I had taken of my niece jumping rope at Disneyworld. It didn't look very promising, so I assumed I would have to shoot another picture, but once I got rolling in Photoshop it started to look good. I carefully colored out the surrounding image to create a transparent map. I then painted in a dress and made a few modifications to make her appear to be a Japanese schoolgirl. I'd recently purchased an inexpensive pressure-sensitive tablet and it was very valuable for this and the other image maps. It also came with Photoshop 5.0 LE, the program I used to edit the images. This was my first pass at a brick wall with stucco/mortar. I hadn't yet used the trace() feature to place the bricks based on the height of the mortar, so the bricks were flat. After spending a week writing the brick wall macro I generated this image. The basic elements were there, the girl's shadow and her rope, the hydrant, door and window. At this point the doors (here represented by a simple texture) were going to be closed. Looking at this image I decided it was too straightforward, too static... So I angled the viewpoint. I was nervous about this chan\nhttps://home.hiwaay.net/~slone/ishadow.html\nI wouldn‚Äôt have to post this, except that Jonathan Buttall is so absurdly defensive about his mistake that he‚Äôs now deleting any comments that point it out, and fulminating about conspiracies and denialism. Ironically, by passing off obviously fake images like this as the real thing, he‚Äôs the one devaluing the very real tragedy of Hiroshima.\nAs I said before I was so rudely deleted: there are blast shadows in Hiroshima. This isn‚Äôt one of them.\nEdit: how strange! If you were wondering where it went, this answer was briefly removed as ‚Äòspam‚Äô, but when I queried this with the moderators they agreed that of course it wasn‚Äôt, and reinstated it. Very odd.

      "11": "One Food I Can No Longer Eat: A Personal Journey\nIn the realm of personal dietary preferences and restrictions, there often comes a point when an individual discovers that there is one particular food they can no longer eat. This revelation can be due to various reasons, ranging from allergies and intolerances to ethical or health choices. In my case, the food I can no longer eat is dairy.\nDairy products, including milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter, were once staples in my diet. I enjoyed the creamy texture of a well-made mac and cheese dish and the comfort of a warm bowl of oatmeal with a dollop of yogurt. However, my relationship with dairy took a significant turn when I began experiencing digestive discomfort, including bloating and stomach cramps, after consuming dairy-rich meals.\nAfter several uncomfortable incidents, I decided to consult a healthcare professional who diagnosed me with lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common condition where the body lacks sufficient lactase, the enzyme required to break down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. As a result, consuming lactose-containing foods leads to gastrointestinal issues.\nThis diagnosis marked the beginning of my journey into the world of dairy-free living. I had to find alternatives for my favorite dairy products, and luckily, the market now offers a wide range of dairy-free options, including almond milk, soy yogurt, and dairy-free cheese.\nTransitioning to a dairy-free lifestyle was not without its challenges. I had to become a vigilant label reader, checking for hidden dairy ingredients in processed foods. Dining out also required more attention, as many restaurant dishes contain dairy products or are cooked in butter. Nonetheless, the effort has been worth it, as my digestive issues disappeared once dairy was removed from my diet.\nFurthermore, my journey toward dairy-free living has broadened my culinary horizons. I've discovered delicious plant-based recipes and learned to appreciate the unique flavors of dairy alternatives. While I sometimes miss the familiarity of dairy, the benefits of a symptom-free life outweigh any cravings I may have.\nIn conclusion, my journey into a dairy-free lifestyle was prompted by lactose intolerance and digestive discomfort. While it has posed challenges, the experience has expanded my culinary repertoire and improved my overall well-being. It's a reminder that our dietary preferences and restrictions can evolve over time, and with a bit of adaptation, we can continue to enjoy a diverse and satisfying diet.",

      "15": "Certainly, let's explore the topic of foods that people may no longer be able to eat due to various reasons. In this article, we'll discuss the concept of food intolerances and allergies, emphasizing the importance of understanding one's dietary limitations.\nOne Food You Can No Longer Eat: Understanding Food Intolerances and Allergies\nIn the diverse world of culinary delights, there's a common thread that binds us all: food. However, for some individuals, enjoying a meal can become a daunting task due to food intolerances or allergies. In this article, we will delve into the realm of dietary restrictions and explore the significance of recognizing and managing them.\nUnderstanding Food Intolerances and Allergies\nFood Intolerances: The Hidden Culprits\nFood intolerances can be likened to stealthy adversaries that lurk within our meals, ready to disrupt our digestive harmony. Common culprits include lactose, gluten, and fructose. These intolerances manifest when the body lacks specific enzymes required for proper digestion. Symptoms often range from bloating and stomach cramps to diarrhea, making it clear that not all foods are universally compatible with every digestive system.\nFood Allergies: A Body's Immune System in Action\nUnlike intolerances, food allergies involve the immune system's response to certain proteins found in food. Think of it as a case of mistaken identity, where the immune system identifies harmless proteins as threats, triggering an allergic reaction. Symptoms can range from mild itching and hives to severe anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.\nIdentifying Problematic Foods\nFor many individuals, pinpointing the exact food causing discomfort can be akin to solving a mystery. Food diaries, elimination diets, and professional guidance from allergists or dietitians often become indispensable tools in the quest to identify problematic foods.\nThe Role of Burstiness in Dietary Adjustments\nUnderstanding the nuances of food intolerances and allergies often requires digesting information in varying degrees of complexity. Burstiness in the context of dietary adjustments means that individuals must navigate a landscape of dietary choices, some straightforward and others intricate.\nFor instance, someone with lactose intolerance may need to decipher food labels for hidden sources of lactose, while also exploring alternative dairy-free products and recipes. This mix of simple and complex decision-making is a hallmark of managing dietary restrictions.\nPerplexity: A Journey Through Dietary Restrictions\nThe journey of dietary restrictions can often be perplexing. Individuals may encounter conflicting information about their condition, dietary recommendations, and the availability of suitable food options. This perplexity emphasizes the importance of seeking reliable sources of information and consulting healthcare professionals for guidance.\nConclusion\nIn a world teeming with gastronomic delights, food intolerances and allergies remind us that not all foods are created equal for everyone. The key to managing these dietary limitations lies in understanding one's own body and making informed choices.

So no more added sugar - no ice cream, cake, cookies or other desserts except lower natural sugar fruit.\nAnd I try to avoid foods with high natural sugar, like dried figs and dates (oh, I really miss those).\nI also avoid white bread because of the high glycemic index (converts to blood glucose very fast). I bake my own high whole grain wheat and rye breads",

Let it med-and-slow roast around 350 degrees and you could get a potato chip texture with just a little give by the sake of the fats. With added butter and oil, that plural is correct.\nThey‚Äôre just not good anymore, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything I‚Äôm doing. Although, one sad-sack has taken the fun out of my kitchen by trying to prove he doesn‚Äôt suck by cooking way too hard, so that might be a small factor. No, I think it was COVID breeding changes.\nThe skin in particular is too fatty in a bad way. There‚Äôs so much more of that gross, horror film looking fat wad that you usually cut off, the shaky, testicularly folded up tubes of fat. When you eat the skin and catch some of that, it squirts a vile hot soup that tastes like a chicken‚Äôs armpit because it is.\nI don‚Äôt know if they started breeding for extra size or growth speed, or maybe we only have a lesser quality of genes available after culling for bird flu. Whatever happened, chicken in general, but especially its skin just doesn‚Äôt taste good anymore, no matter how anyone makes it.\nedit/update: I figured it out.

I drank coffee until about noon, and then Coke until I went to bed that night. If it was after 12:00, everyone knew I would have a can of Coke in my hand.\nThen, about 15 years ago there were a couple years where I had repeated bouts of ‚Äúcolitis‚Äù. No one was ever able to pin down what would cause the episodes, and generic ‚Äúcolitis‚Äù was the best diagnosis anyone could come up with. I would feel fine, then a sharp pain would start in my lower left abdomen and within a few hours I‚Äôd be in the ER/hospital spewing from both ends until there was nothing left to spew. I‚Äôd be so dehydrated and weak that they‚Äôd admit me to the hospital. During those episodes the only things I could keep down were ginger ale and Gatorade.\nThen, I had an especially bad episode where they kept me in the hospital for close to a week (I was in the hospital longer for that than when I had my heart attack). Now, unless I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúcolitis episode‚Äù I can‚Äôt stand the taste of sodas. I can take a couple sips but that‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt even finish one of those 7.5 oz mini cans of soda.

I have also learned that beef is not a necessary part of a healthy diet.\nBeef production is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, and water pollution. It also requires a lot of land and resources. In addition, many beef cattle are raised in inhumane conditions.\nI know that not everyone agrees with me about not eating beef. However, I believe that it is important to make choices that are good for the environment and for animals. I have found that there are many delicious and nutritious plant-based foods that I can enjoy instead of beef.\nIf you are thinking about reducing your beef consumption, here are a few tips:\nStart by gradually reducing the amount of beef you eat each week.\nLook for plant-based alternatives to beef, such as beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh.\nExperiment with different recipes and cooking methods.\nDon't be afraid to try new things!\nThere are many delicious and nutritious plant-based foods that you can enjoy.

      "2": "Turenne, the French marshal killed by a cannonball.\nHenri De La Tour d‚ÄôAuvergne, Viscount of Turenne was a French Huguenot nobleman in the 17th century, the son of a Marshal of France. After beginning his career in the Army of the Dutch Republic because he was a Protestant, eventually he returned home and joined the French army.\nOver a career that spanned decades, he fought the Bavarians (there is a Bavarian general who fought- and even defeated- Turenne, Franz von Mercy, who would make a good answer to this question himself) the Spanish, other Frenchmen in the Great civil wars of the Fronde, and the Austrians among many others, vanquishing them all.\nIn 1672, the French attacked the Dutch Republic, and initially did very well- too well, as it turned out, because their success alarmed the other Great Powers and they found themselves at war with Spain, Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire, just as the English, their only allies, made peace. As the Dutch flooded their country to stop them, the French were forced to pull back to face these new threats.\nTurenne took command in Germany, fighting an Imperial army commanded by the brilliant Italian general Raimondo Montecuccoli in Alsace. In a campaign regarded as one of his best (a high bar already) he defeated the Imperials several times, eventually smashing another Imperial commander at the Battle of Turckheim using a lightning attack against one of the Imperial flanks, foregoing a preparatory artillery barrage and relying on speed and surprise to carry the day.\nHe then faced Montecuccoli again, and the two manoeuvred around each other until at last they confronted one another at Salzbach on the 27th of July 1675. An artillery duel began, with both sides attempting to place their batteries in the most advantageous position to suppress the other side‚Äôs guns.\nThe French artillery commander asked Turenne to come and have a look at a potential site for a battery in person; Turenne agreed, rode out to have a look, and strayed out in front of the Imperial artillery, who fired upon his party. A cannonball took off the arm of one of his subordinates before hitting Turenne, who took a couple of steps and then collapsed. He died soon afterwards.\nA 19th century depiction of the fate of Turenne\nMontecuccoli admired Turenne, and he did genuinely mourn his rival‚Äôs passing, while defeating the now leaderless French army as it retreated. The French were forced to place their other star general, the Prince of Conde, in the theatre to replace him.",

      "4": "Since survival naturally correlates with success in battle, most of the great generals in history had long careers and either died from natural causes or were assassinated. The short list of such commanders includes the likes of Napoleon, Caesar, Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Patton, Frederick the Great, Von Moltke the elder, and Belisarius. A few great generals died on campaign but in most cases these were natural deaths brought on by illness, old age and the rigors of the campaign. Tamerlane, Attila the Hun and possibly Genghis Khan died that way.\nThat said, I think there are two ways to answer your question. The first is to name the best general who died in battle at the end of a long military career. For this distinction I nominate Cyrus the Great. The founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus conquered the Medes, Lydians and Babylonians over his thirty years in the field. According to Herodotus, Cyrus died in 529 BC on campaign against the Massagetae, a tribe on the southern steppes of Central Asia. The Massagetae were led by an empress, Tomyris. Eager to acquire her lands, Cyrus first offered to marry her. When she refused, Cyrus‚Äô forces began raiding Massagetae territory. Finally, Tomyris offered battle at a set time and place to settle the matter. To tip the scales, on the eve of battle Cyrus allowed the enemy to find and loot a camp stocked with wine and defended by his worst soldiers. The Massagetae took the bait and thus a division of their best troops were soon drunk off their asses. The Persians swept in, slaughtering most Massagetae in and around the camp and capturing their commander, Tomyris‚Äô son, who killed himself in disgrace. Enraged at Persian duplicity, the empress rallied her troops for a counterattack. The unprepared Persian forces were, in turn, overwhelmed and Cyrus died in the fighting. That the man who brought the Iranian Plateau, Asia Minor, Assyria, Babylon, the Levant, Armenia and Bactria under Persian rule should suffer such an ignoble end is one of history‚Äôs great morality tale.\nCyrus the Great, the original King of Kings\nOn the other hand you have the commanders who died during the course of the victories for which they are most famous.\nThe commander who, in my opinion, achieved the greatest bump in fame and reputation by dying at a moment of triumph is Horatio Nelson. Nelson was a scourge to the fleets of the French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. His victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798 doomed Napoleon‚Äôs invasion of Egypt and made Nelson a British hero. The Battle of Trafalgar, in 1805, however, would make him a god. Fought off the coast of Gibraltar, Nelson‚Äôs fleet annihilated a Franco-Spanish armada, a force larger than his own that represented the bulk of Napoleon‚Äôs naval forces. Attacking from the flank in two columns, Nelson‚Äôs fleet cut the French line into three pieces that it then destroyed piecemeal through superior gunnery. 22 of Napoleon‚Äôs ships went down. The Royal Navy lost none.\nAny threat of the French invading England went down with Villeneuve‚Äôs ships. Moreover, after Trafalgar, the Royal Navy‚Äôs supremacy would go unchallenged until the First World War. This one victory, therefore, marks the real beginning of the second British Empire and the Splendid Isolation of the 19th century.

In the end, the British forces would carry the day, forcing the French to evacuate Quebec. The conqueror of Fort William Henry and Fort Edward, no commander had done more to protect New France that Montcalm. Unfortunately, it took Montcalm a day to succumb to the bullet wound he suffered on the Plains of Abraham, thus he died knowing the fate of New France was sealed. Wolfe, for his part, had died within the first few minutes of the battle and was thus oblivious to its outcome.\nThe Plains of Abraham is one of the only climactic battles I know during which both commanders were killed. Both were celebrated men in their respective kingdoms but in death, they were both practically deified. Like rivals who became blood brothers, their names are forever intertwined by the battle that claimed their lives.\nBenjamin West‚Äôs painting of Wolfe‚Äôs death\nFor two years Stonewall Jackson was a terror to the Union. He earned his sobriquet after his refusal to retreat during the First Battle of Bull Run. The stalwart fighting of his men inspired the Confederate counterattack that turned the battle.

Lee‚Äôs most reliable corps commander after that, keying victories at Second Bull Run and Fredericksburg.\nDuring Lee‚Äôs failed invasion of Maryland in September 1862, Jackson and his men supposedly encountered Barbara Fritchie, an old matron in the town of Frederick who refused to lower the American flag hanging above her house. Jackson was so impressed by her bravery that he forbade his men from harming Fritchie or her flag. The incident would become the subject of a poem published the following October. By then both Fritchie and Jackson had already passed from this earth into legend.\nJackson died in May 1863 from wounds suffered at Chancellorsville, Lee‚Äôs greatest victory.

      "5": "Gustavus Adolphus hands down and without any doubt. The man is heralded as the Father of Modern warfare, being one of the first military commanders to use a true combined arms approach. He revolutionized artillery in just about every way, from the way it was constructed to how it was used, and even how it was transported. His logistical ability probably hasn't been equaled since the time of Hannibal Barca and Alexander the Great. While the other armies of Europe pillaged and raped the countryside, literally raped and pillaged villages and the people in them, Gustavus managed to retain military discipline and order, and keep his troops supplied so such atrocities weren't committed(at least no where near as often). His army was the most, and probably only truly professional, home raised force of the time. The rest of Europe relied largely on mercenary forces to do battle against each other. He was a skilled and cunning tactician, that brought low the Count of Tilly in pitched battle, which no one had been able to do. If he hadn't died during a cavalry charge the course of the Thirty years war, and likely all of history would have been greatly altered.\nHe's one of the most underrated military geniuses in history in my humble opinion. And it's a shame his exploits aren't taught more in the West. I'd never heard of him before I began my own exploration of military history.",

Nephew of King Louis XII of France and general of his armies in Italy from 1511 to 1512, he is noted for his military feats in a career which lasted no longer than a few months. The young general is regarded as a stellar commander well ahead of his time. An adept of lightning fast forced marches as well as sudden and bold offensives that destabilized contemporary armies and commanders, De Foix is mostly remembered for his six-month campaign against the Holy League in the War of the League of Cambrai . He met his end in said conflict, at the age of 22, during the Battle of Ravenna (1512) , the last of his triumphs. Born in Maz√®res , County of Foix , he was the second child but only son of John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne and Marie d'Orl√©ans . [2] His older sister was Germaine of Foix , Queen consort of Aragon as the second wife of Ferdinand II . His paternal grandparents were Gaston IV of Foix-Grailly and Queen regnant Eleanor of Navarre . His maternal grandparents were Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans and Marie of Cleves . His only maternal uncle was Louis XII of France . In 1511, Gaston arrived in Italy as a new commander at the age of 21. His presence and energy shifted the conflict into much higher levels of activity. French forces had captured Bologna on 13 May 1511 and were under siege from a combined Papal-Spanish army commanded by Ram√≥n de Cardona , the Viceroy of Naples . Gaston marched his army to Bologna and scattered the armies of the Holy League that retreated to Ravenna. In October 1511, Pope Julius II formed the Holy League with Ferdinand of Aragon and the Republic of Venice. Its stated aim was to recover the lands taken from the Papacy, and this meant driving the French out of Italy. So Gaston now faced an invasion from the Swiss from the north, the Papal-Aragonese from the south and Venice from the east. The Swiss took Bellinzona in December 1511, but Gaston refrained from attacking them, fearing that if he left Milan then the people would rebel behind his back. Instead he reinforced Bologna that was under renewed attack from Julius II's army. The Swiss unable to draw Gaston out, retreated as winter set in. In February 1512, Gaston left Milan to relieve Brescia under attack from Venice, and beat them. It is said that when Julius II heard of the defeat he tore out his beard, but in the meantime Cardona had retaken most of the Romagna.

During his reign, Sweden became one of the primary military forces in Europe during the Thirty Years' War , helping to determine the political and religious balance of power in Europe. He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great ( Swedish : Gustav Adolf den store ; Latin : Gustavus Adolphus Magnus ) by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634. [2] [3] [4] He is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history, with use of an early form of combined arms . [5] His most notable military victory was the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. With his resources, logistics, and support, Gustavus Adolphus was positioned to become a major European leader, [6] but he was killed a year later at the Battle of L√ºtzen . He was assisted in his efforts by Count Axel Oxenstierna , the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden , who also acted as regent after his death. Coming to the throne at the age of 16, Gustavus Adolphus inherited three wars from his father Charles IX of Sweden : border conflicts with Russia and Denmark‚ÄìNorway , and a dynastic struggle with his first cousin, King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland . [7] Of these, the Danish war was the most serious. [8] During his reign, Sweden rose from the status of a Baltic Sea basin regional power to one of the great powers of Europe and a model of early modern era government. Gustavus Adolphus is known as the \"father of modern warfare\", [9] or the first modern general. He taught a number of other military commanders, such as Lennart Torstensson , who would go on to expand the boundaries and power of the Swedish Empire after Gustavus Adolphus's death. Spoils meant he became a successful bookraider in Europe, targeting Jesuit collections. [10] His contributions to Sweden's rise in power included reformation of the administrative structure. For example, he began Parish Registration of the population, so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript the people. [11] He is also widely commemorated by Protestants in Europe as the main defender of their cause during the Thirty Years' War, with multiple churches, foundations and other undertakings named after him, including the Gustav-Adolf-Werk . [12] [13] Biographical details [ edit ] Gustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm on 9 December 1594, eldest son of Duke Charles of the House of Vasa and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp .

The most illustrious member of the La Tour d'Auvergne family, his military exploits over his five-decade career earned him a reputation as one of the greatest military commanders in history. Born to a Huguenot family, the son of a Marshal of France , he was introduced to the art of war at a young age. He first served as a volunteer in the Dutch States Army under the orders of his maternal uncles Maurice of Nassau and Frederick Henry but later chose to continue his career in the service of France, where his noble origins and proven qualities soon saw him rise to the top of the military hierarchy. He rose to prominence during the Thirty Years' War by capturing the fortress of Breisach in 1638. Promoted Marshal of France in 1643, he struck against Bavaria the following year, defeating the Bavarian army in three years of campaigning and forcing the Elector of Bavaria to make peace. The Elector soon broke the treaty and in 1648 Turenne invaded again with Swedish support, subduing the Imperial army at Zusmarshausen and pacifying Bavaria. Turenne initially supported the Fronde but returned to Royal service in 1651, emerging as France's foremost general by defeating the rebellious army of the Prince of Cond√© on the outskirts of Paris and re-occupying the city. His triumphs against Spanish armies at Arras (1654) and at Dunkirk (1658) led to the overrunning of much of the Spanish Netherlands and brought the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. Two years later, Louis XIV appointed him Marshal General of France. Although a supporter of absolute monarchy , he only converted to Catholicism in 1668, refusing to do so earlier despite political incentives. During the War of Devolution in 1667 Turenne captured the Spanish Netherlands practically without resistance. In 1672 the French invaded the Dutch Republic and the Marshal General conquered the country up to Amsterdam . Checked by the Dutch flooding of the land, he invaded the Holy Roman Empire the next year, reaching the Elbe and compelling Brandenburg to abandon the anti-French coalition. Faced with the loss of Alsace to superior Allied forces, he crowned his career with a series of battlefield victories, most notably at Turckheim (1675) and a masterful strategic turning movement around the Vosges in mid-winter that drove the Imperials from Alsace. He was killed by an Imperial cannonball at the battle of Salzbach in 1675.

Leonidas I was a son of King Anaxandridas II . He succeeded his half-brother King Cleomenes I to the throne in c. 489 BC. His co-ruler was King Leotychidas . He was succeeded by his son, King Pleistarchus . At the Second Greco-Persian War , Leonidas led the allied Greek forces in a last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC), attempting to defend the pass from the invading Persian army, and was killed early in the battle. Leonidas entered myth as a hero and the leader of the 300 Spartans. While the Greeks lost this battle, they were able to expel the Persian invaders in the following year. According to Herodotus , Leonidas' mother was not only his father's wife, but also his father's niece and had been barren for so long that the ephors , the five annually elected administrators of the Spartan constitution, tried to prevail upon King Anaxandridas II to set her aside and take another wife. Anaxandridas refused, claiming his wife was blameless, whereupon the ephors agreed to allow him to take a second wife without setting aside his first. This second wife, a descendant of Chilon of Sparta (one of the Seven Sages of Greece ), promptly bore a son, Cleomenes . However, one year after Cleomenes' birth, Anaxandridas' first wife also gave birth to a son, Dorieus . Leonidas was the second son of Anaxandridas' first wife, and either the elder brother or twin of Cleombrotus . [1] King Anaxandridas II died in c. 524 BC, [2] and Cleomenes succeeded to the throne sometime between then and 516 BC. [3] Dorieus was so outraged that the Spartans had preferred his half-brother over himself that he found it impossible to remain in Sparta. He made one unsuccessful attempt to set up a colony in Africa and, when this failed, sought his fortune in Sicily, where after initial successes he was killed. [4] Leonidas' relationship with his bitterly antagonistic elder brothers is unknown, but he married Cleomenes' daughter, Gorgo , sometime before coming to the throne in 490 BC. [5] Leonidas was heir to the Agiad throne and a full citizen ( homoios ) at the time of the Battle of Sepeia against Argos (c. 494 BC). [6] Likewise, he was a full citizen when the Persians sought submission from Sparta and met with vehement rejection in 492/491 BC. His elder half-brother, king Cleomenes, had already been deposed on grounds of purported insanity, and had fled into exile when Athens sought assistance against the First Persian invasion of Greece , that ended at Marathon (490 BC). The Spartans throw Persian envoys into a well. Plutarch wrote, ‚ÄúWhen someone said to him: 'Except for being king you are not at all superior to us,' Leonidas son of Anaxandridas and brother of Cleomenes replied: 'But were I not\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_I\nPyrrhus the Eagle (well if Hannibals opinion counts, he would be the clear No#1)\nPyrrhus of Epirus - Wikipedia\nKing of Epirus from 297 to 272 BC This article is about the Epirote king. For other uses, see Pyrrhus . Pyrrhus ( / Àà p …™r …ô s / ; Greek : Œ†œçœÅœÅŒøœÇ P√Ωrrhos ; 319/318‚Äì272 BC) was a Greek king and statesman of the Hellenistic period . [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] He was king of the Molossians , [5] [7] of the royal Aeacid house, [8] and later he became king ( Malalas also called him toparch ) [9] of Epirus . He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome , and had been regarded as one of the greatest generals of antiquity. [10] Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term \" Pyrrhic victory \" was coined. Pyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by Cassander four years later. He saw action during the Wars of the Diadochi and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of Ptolemy I Soter . During what came to be known as the Pyrrhic War , Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of Tarentum , scoring costly victories at Heraclea and Asculum . He proceeded to take over Sicily from Carthage but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the Battle of Beneventum in 275 BC. Pyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from Antigonus II Gonatas in 274 BC and invaded the Peloponnese in 272 BC. The Epirote assault on Sparta was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at Argos . Etymology [ edit ] The Latinized Pyrrhus derives from the Greek Pyrrhos ( / Àà p …™r …ô s / ; Greek : Œ†œçœÅœÅŒøœÇ ), meaning flame-like or flammable, derived from the word Pyr ( / Àà p …™r / ; Greek : Œ†œçœÅ ) meaning fire and the suffix -ros ( / Àà r …ô s / ; Greek : œÅŒøœÇ ) meaning -able or \"pertaining to\". [11] According to others, the name's actual meaning is \"fiery, red-coloured\", and was especially used to denote red hair. [12] Pyrrhos was also used as an alternate name for Neoptolemus , son of Achilles and the princess Deidamia in Homeric Greek mythology . [11] Early life [ edit ] In c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince Aeacides of Epirus , [13] and Phthia , a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general Menon . Aeacides was a cousin of Olympias , making Pyrrhus a second cousin to Alexander the Great . He had two sisters: Deidamia and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and Neoptolemus . Aeacides supported Olympias in her fight against Cassander and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect be\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus\nEpaminondas the Spartanslayer\nEpaminondas - Wikipedia\nTheban general and statesman (d. 362 BC) Epaminondas ( / …™ Àå p √¶ m …™ Àà n …í n d …ô s / ; Greek : ·ºòœÄŒ±ŒºŒµŒπŒΩœéŒΩŒ¥Œ±œÇ ; 419/411‚Äì362 BC) was a Greek general of Thebes and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the Ancient Greek city-state , leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics called the Theban Hegemony . In the process, he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots , a group of Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years after being defeated in the Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several major battlefield tactics. Xenophon , the historian and contemporary, is the main source for Epaminondas' military prowess, and Xenophon describes his admiration for him in his major work Hellenica (book VII, chap. 5, 19). Accordingly, in later centuries the Roman orator, Cicero called him \"the first man of Greece\", and even in modern times Montaigne judged him one of the three \"worthiest and most excellent men\" that had ever lived. The changes Epaminondas wrought on the Greek political order did not long outlive him, as the cycle of shifting hegemonies and alliances continued unabated. A mere twenty-seven years after his death, a recalcitrant Thebes was obliterated by Alexander the Great . Thus Epaminondas‚Äîwho had been praised in his time as an idealist and liberator‚Äîis today largely remembered for a decade (371 BC to 362 BC) of campaigning that sapped the strength of the great city-states and paved the way for Macedonian hegemony. Historical sources [ edit ] The life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries (e.g. Philip II of Macedon , Pelopidas ). One principal reason for this is the loss of Plutarch 's biography of him. Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by Plutarch in his Parallel Lives , in which he is paired with the Roman statesman Scipio Africanus ; however, both these \"Lives\" are now lost. [1] Plutarch was writing over 400 years after Epaminondas's death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. [ citation needed ] Some episodes of Epaminondas's life can be found in Plutarch's \"Lives\" of Pelopidas and Agesilaus II , who were contemporaries. There is also a surviving (and possibly abridged) biography of Epaminondas by the Roman author Cornelius Nepos from the first century BC which, in the absence of Plutarch's, becomes a major source for Epaminondas's life. The period of Greek history from 411‚Äì362 BC is primarily attested by the historian, contemporary and direct witness Xenophon , his wor\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas\nand probably a few more, who deserve this spot",

When they weren't busy entertaining spectators, their great strength and intelligence was utilized to clear wreckage after bombing raids by the Allies. Here they are seen moving a wrecked car from a bombed-out garage.\nThe threat posed by air raids from the German Luftwaffe was severe in Great Britain. On September 1st, 1939 blackout conditions were imposed in Great Britain. With the total lack of illumination at night, it changed the lives of everyone in the British Isles. In the city and out in the rural areas. An Essex farmer paints a black cow with white stripes. This was done in case in the event the cow managed to get out of it‚Äôs pasture and wander on the road after dusk. The stripes were intended to increase the visibility of livestock to the motorists in the blackout to prevent any potential vehicular accidents.\nAs German war-making capability declined, a \"dim-out\" was introduced in September 1944, which allowed lighting to the equivalent of moonlight. A full blackout would be imposed if an alert was sounded. Full lighting of streets was allowed in April 1945. On April 30th, the day Hitler committed suicide, the Big Ben Tower was lit, 5 years and 123 days after the blackout was first imposed.\n***Photo sources from Imperial War Museums- Unbelievable Images from Weird War Two.***",
      "3": "This photo does not look strange at all, a bunch of American guards at a prison.\nHowever, the story of these guards is astonishing. This is Nuremburg and the prisoners are high-ranking Nazis on trial for their lives - and the guards are from the 20th SS Panzergrenadier Division, survivors of the Battle of Berlin and now dressed in American uniforms and renamed the 4221st Guard Battalion.\nThe 20th SS was a powerful, full-strength division formed in Estonia in 1944 of Estonian anti-Bolshevists, draftees and ethnic German officers. It fought in some of the most vicious combat on the Eastern Front, retaking land from the Russians at great cost and stabilizing the line where other units had failed. Every time the Division was exhausted, it was refit and put back into the line over a period of weeks, not months because of the desperate nature of the situation at the time. The Division was finally inserted on the left flank of the 56th Panzer Korps outside Berlin, the Corps of 4 divisions from the 9th Army trapped in Halbe that was commanded by General Wiedling and that eventually got trapped in Berlin at the end, and destroyed. The 56th Panzer Korps had absorbed the 20th SS as it was splintered from its parent force.\nHowever, before the Russians encircled Berlin, the 20th SS Panzergrenadier Division as a whole decided it had had enough and bugged out from the front, without orders, without alerting 56th Panzer Korps headquarters and drove through Berlin, which was being bombed and shelled back to the Stone Age, and with all their equipment and a few tanks, kept on going to the West until they surrendered to the Americans.\nWhen Weidling discovered the massive hole in his flank where an entire Division had been, it was a catastrophe. He plugged the hole with thousands of Hitler Youth provided by Artur Axmann and survivors of the crumbling 9th Parachute Division which had turned and run in the face of the Russian advance earlier and allowed the front to crumble. The 9th had been a special prestige division built up personally by Herman Goering and he was totally disgusted when it faded in combat. By that time, only parts of divisions and even Armies were left and pieces re-assembled to form battle groups. Even at this stage I cannot figure out why these soldiers continued to fight in that meat grinder, with no hope of victory, with only death to look forward to, even their parent units decimated and scattered, without supplies or weapons. The Russians surged through the gap, easily pushing aside the Hitler Youth who died by the hundreds, and the 9th Parachute Division was no longer of any combat value.\nMeanwhile, the Americans decided that as Estonian conscripts the 20th SS were not actually Nazis and took the 600 survivors, put them in American uniforms and assigned them to guard German prisoners because they could speak multiple languages. They ended up being the primary guard service at Nuremburg.\nThe Russians were apoplectic by this action and demanded an investigation. One battalion of the Division was charged with war crimes for shooting up a Czech town but that Battalion had been destroyed in combat. So it was hard to charge the Division with any other war crimes. The Russians occupied Estonia for decades after the war until the USSR broke up and bitterly made the Estonians pay collectively for the acts of the Nazis. Today, the enmity between Estonia and Russia is still raw. The Estonians are like a pimple to the Russians and Putin has threatened to invade numerous times and has launched all-out cyber warfare on the tiny nation. NATO has a division stationed in the tiny country to provide morale and support. Trump actually said that NATO, at least the US part, would never go to war to defend Estonia, that they weren‚Äôt worth it, and thus was handing the Baltics to Putin in another scraping bow to his Master, Putin. In response, NATO moved a division into Estonia, who published a book for all its citizens called ‚ÄúWhat To Do When War Comes‚Äù.\nEvery time you turn around, WW2 provides another astonishing story.",

      "35": "It is not necessarily a lack of respect for President Biden that may be behind President Xi Jinping not speaking in English. The primary language spoken by President Xi and his government is Chinese, and it is common for leaders to communicate in their native language in official settings. Additionally, official translation services are typically provided during international meetings and discussions, so the lack of English language proficiency would not necessarily hinder communication. Additionally, it's also a matter of protocol and tradition, many world leaders tend to communicate in their national language.

      "42": "Why doesn‚Äôt Joe Biden speak Chinese? There 4 times as many Chinese people as there are Americans.",
      "43": "Traditionally, at the diplomatic level, a Head of State speaks his language, even if he knows perfectly the language of his interlocutor.\nSo even if Xi is a post doctorate in English, he WILL NEVER SPEAK ENGLISH IN PUBLIC.",
      "44": "Two reasons.\nFirst, it is customary in International Relations to speak in your own language. Every international meeting has tons of translators who are studying for it for years or decades.\nThe second, knowing another country language but deliberately not speaking it gives a huge leverage. There is little Biden or any US diplomat say that Xi doesn‚Äôt understand, so Xi has a lot of time to process what he will talk while he waits for the translation, while Biden must necessarily wait for the translation to start process what he will speak next. Life tip: if you ever find yourself in a negotiation or meeting which has translation, wait for the official, and use that time to think about what you will say.",
      "45": "I may be incorrect but I think those leaders usually speak their own language to show respect to their own culture and not to ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù to others culture.\nSometimes it also helps to make sure what they said is clearly delivered without mis communications.",
      "46": "This is troll question meant to get others to hate on different countries. Many people on here took the bait. The OP asking the question is extremely ignorant, but ironically so are many of the answers.",
      "47": "Because they're speaking as representatives of their countries, it is natural- and expected - for the leader to speak in the language they're most comfortable in.\nAnd then the Foreign Service of that country will translate it into the recipient country's language, while making sure the tone, intent and meaning are intact.\nThe interpreters who work for Xi Jinping aren't idiots - they're highly qualified professionals who know exactly what their boss wants said, and how to phrase it correctly in a language the boss may not be a specialist in.\nNarendra Modi, the PM of India, speaks English reasonably well but not at global standards. His Hindi speeches are amazing, their English versions are (respectfully) not as good - but the Indian Foreign Service knows how to translate his words with impact and convey the right meaning.\nNations choose their leaders based on ability to govern, not just ability to speak multiple languages. And then we hire the best interpreters we have to do the slightly less complex job of translation.\nSo Xi Jinping doesn't need to know English. He has people for that :)\nSide note: PV Narasimha Rao, Indian Prime Minister in 1992, spoke 17 languages, including 7 foreign languages plus English.\nBiden speaks English and (maybe) some French.\nThe last US President to speak Chinese was Herbert Hoover.\nBeing able to speak multiple languages doesn't necessarily make you a good leader of your country. Though it's a pretty awesome trick.",
      "48": "Depends on how you look at it.\nA man who speaks in a conversational partner‚Äôs language can put that man at ease and thus gain the power of cordiality in deepening the conversation to levels where it is not necessary to dance around, fencing words over what each side wishes to convey or gain.\nBut if it‚Äôs not how he /thinks/, in terms of word-symbols, it will be a fatiguing process of constant juggled internal translations.\nThere are many polyglots who can speak a given language, even fluently, but are most comfortable thinking in another and when trying to measure one‚Äôs words, diplomatically, it is always necessary to put one‚Äôs intent and indeed position (as Premier of China, with power and commitment associated with what is said) ahead of politeness.\nMuch weight is put behind the intellect of those who can share their thoughts in multiple symbologic construct forms. But the fact remains that languages are engramatic not idiomatic. How smart you think is directly connected to how often you link to it in a specific neuro-cognitive set of linked synapses as a word-total sense perspective (350‚Äì500,000 Chinese distinct terms, 600,000 Oxford English ones). Think of this not in terms of superiority of working vocabulary but of the required doubling of memory association counts in holding a usefully balanced vocabulary for both languages. Leaving only a little bit of memory left for the working memory of what you use those word symbols for.\nA man who speaks at a collegiate level in Chinese may have only a colloquial HSD understanding of English. More importantly it‚Äôs not authentic. Because the environment he was raised in, socially and genetically, has incorporated different meanings due to different biologically selected ways of thinking.\nChinese have superior math-spatials capability. But their verbals are about average. If you want an authentic Chinese view, you will get it by triggering those parts of the mind which speak the way the individual thinks and not the way he wants you to think he‚Äôs smart because of the number of distinct ways he can make linked breath noises.\nXi Xinping is a busy man who has the weight of his nation upon him, at all times. If he wishes to speak in Chinese so that a translator can verbalize it and he can ‚Äòlisten to the echo‚Äô for authenticism, correcting for intent where needed, he has every right to do so.\nIn this, you need to understand that your thoughts are your soul‚Äôs domain.\nThey are how it pictures itself, relative to world. It is a very private, intimate, thing. Having to expose those thoughts by effectively speaking in the way other peoples view the world can leave you exposed and unintentionally inflected in a way that the ‚Äòoriginal Chinese‚Äô would not consider to be so twisted or blunt. Thus, speaking in the tongue you know is a kind of encryption to how you conceive your worldview as well as a shelter for it‚Äôs sophistication.\nThis inner privacy of cognition is not well understood in The West but is common throughout Asia as the notion of face and the inner and outer (social) expressions of self.\nElites have known this truth for a _long_ time.\nWhen the Patrician Romans chose to speak Greek in front of their slaves and plebs and the New English kept to themselves with Norman French for generations after they conquered Saxon England. It was to form a protective isolate that kept the masses from swallowing and crushing the identity of the colonizer.\nFor the rest of us, speaking plainly allows for a broader technical vocabulary and also the pleasure of direct speech. Whereby what you say has meaning because you ‚Äòwalk the talk‚Äô as an SME and seldom speak beyond your ability to deliver as a different kind of discipline.\nAmericans in particular are well known and respected for this and should never abandon it, simply to seem more sophisticated.\nNever denigrate someone for the ability to speak only one way.\nRather, judge them for how _well_ they speak, what they know. A gifted speaker is someone who has mastered the vocabulary of what they find important. And if you share the interest or are reliant upon the expertise, it is often refreshing and illuminating to hear the words as spoken by a true master of the subject.",
      "49": "Why does the president not bow to the king of England? Because they are on the same stage as them. It‚Äôs about image honestly, psychological warfare. I do believe Xi Jinping likely speaks better English than Biden does Chinese, but if you are a world leader, you do not bow to the customs of your neighbors or they will view you as weak. Men bow to lords and nobles, kings in all shapes and forms, but lords only bow to the gods up high. If you are a world leader it is not your place to worry of language when a lesser man can speak to your counterparts in your stead. Having the translator in play portrays an image to both sides, the media and the populace and it is just one of the many ways that such men try to assert dominance.",
      "50": "In diplomacy it's standard practice to use a translator.\nIn the 90's I met the translator for a senior Japanese Minister. He was always on edge as the Minister spoke perfect English and used to have a session with him after every meeting with a foreign official to correct his mistranslations. Basically, you effed this up, you missed this nuance, etc.\nIn simple terms it gives both sides more time to think and react when having a conversation.\nThat, plus China made Chinese the official language for all government announcements and dealings 10-15 years ago. They used to do media releases and announcements in English prior to that. After all, Mandarin Chinese has been spoken by a population of hundreds of millions for 2000 years."

      "4": "Today‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs birthday. She‚Äôs turned 14.\nFor the first 5 years and 8 months of my life, I was a single child. Despite what many people may think, being a single child is pretty much great. You have all the attention to yourself. You don‚Äôt have to share desserts. Or toys.\nBut it‚Äôs also pretty lonely.\nMy parents were never home, and I didn‚Äôt play with children my age because well, I knew only a couple children my age. The fact that I didn‚Äôt attend kindergarten like most kids only made it ‚Äúworse‚Äù.\nWhen my mother got pregnant with my sister, she spent quite a long time at home. When she was 4 months pregnant, she was put in maternity leave. She worked at Recer\n, at the department of control quality, and had some lab work too, so she was in contact with some chemical stuff. I remember Recer threw these huuuuge Christmas parties for employees‚Äô children, they put up concerts for us and we all received presents. It was one of the few occasions in which I interacted with children my age.\nHaving my mother at home was weird at first. I wasn‚Äôt really used to have her around so I was pretty shy at first. But it was also great. It gave an opportunity to actually get to know her.\nWe spent hours to no end watching Indiana Jones and James Bond. She taught me the very little English that she actually knew. We‚Äôd go to visit my father at his factory (yes, he owned it) and spend hours on that computer on his office, and talking to the secretary.\nWe‚Äôd go to the beach in Costa Nova and Praia da Barra and eat tripas and farturas, even if it was cold. We‚Äôd go to Barr√¥ to visit my friend, or we‚Äôd go to √Ågueda to visit my father‚Äôs friends and their kids.\nI remember when we went for one of the ultrasounds in a clinic in Aveiro.\nMy sister was doing the thumbs up sign.\nI giggled.\nMy mother was ironing some clothes when she went into labour.

During this time my Bhabhi was looking for jobs in schools but was being rejected every time due to poor communication skill (English). It was one of her fears, that she lived with for almost 27 years. That day I remember, when I was sitting and reading something when she got an interview call.\nThe person on the other side of the call was constantly shooting questions in English and I can see the fear and reluctance to speak in her eyes as well as voice.\nResult: Rejected Again!\nSeeing this I felt bad, and decided to teach her English in any possible way. I then sat with her and talked to her about this. She told about this as her one of the biggest fears. I somehow convinced her to give it a try to learn and speak English.\nA beautiful quote I used from one of the articles and used at that moment:\n10 Years from now, if you see yourself. How would you project? A person living with her fears or the person coming out of fears?\nDo you want to live with your problems or you want to solve them?\nThis not only convinced her but also she was enthusiastic about learning.\nInstalled many learning apps on her smartphone, some news apps like TOI etc.\nTold her to read any article a day and keep sending me emails in her own words. I would then read them and send her back the mistakes that she did in those emails.\nLeft Delhi on 19th Nov‚Äô16.\nSince then, she‚Äôs sending me emails almost every day.\nThis is one of those emails that she sent to me on 27th Jan‚Äô17.\nReading this just simply made my day.\nObviously, there are many mistakes in the email but I overlooked it that day and just went with the emotion that was in it. I was literally into tears!\nThis happiness made my day.",

    "title": "How will the war in Israel affect Western support for Ukrainian Nazis",
    "answers": {
      "1": "It is entirely apparent that you are not actually asking a question. You are attempting to convey two statements.\nThe first statement is that the terrorist attack on Israel will negatively affect Western support for Ukraine.\nThe second statement you are attempting to covey is that the Ukrainians are Nazis.\nAmerica and the West will continue to fund Ukraine to ensure they are not enslaved by Russia. The West fully realizes that Russia and Putin in particular is attempting to reconstitute the Soviet Union. Putin‚Äôs first step was to enslave Ukraine in his march to take over the world by reconstituting the Soviet Union. If the West ended their funding for Ukraine, in the next few years everyone would have to double their defense spending to fight off the reconstituted Soviets. It is far less expensive to stop Russia from their imperial ambitions now rather than wait for them to become larger and more dangerous as they swallowed up Eastern Europe.\nAs far as funding the Israelis, this is also necessary to halt the modern Nazis from attacking the Jewish people. The West can afford to assist both the besieged Ukrainians and to help keep the Jews from being annihilated by the modern Nazis.\nYour second statement accuses the Ukrainians of being Nazis. There are 42 million Ukrainians who have absolutely no Nazi or Neo-Nazi leanings. When Russia attacked and occupied Crimea in 2014, the defenders were the Azov Brigade. There were approximately 2,500 members of the Azov Brigade of which some had neo-Nazi beliefs. During the Siege of Mariupol, the regiment played a prominent role in the city's defense, and made its final stand at the Azovstal steel plant. The Azov Brigade is now incorporated into the Ukrainian military and they no longer hold neo-Nazi beliefs. Now if we look at the true Nazis in Ukraine it is the Russians. Their mercenary core was named the Wagner group. The terrorist Russian state attacked Ukraine using the, ‚ÄúWagner Group.‚Äù This group is named after a major symbol of the WWII actual Nazis (Richard Wagner). Hitler idolized Wagner for his music and his radical politics. Members of the Wagner Group, a Russian network of private security contractors, have been linked to indiscriminate killings of civilians in Ukraine. Russia in turn idolized Wagner so they named their elite mercenary group after the German composer. Who exactly are the Nazis?\nBelow is a Russian soldier captured in Ukraine with Nazi tattoos.",
      "2": "The international fascism of the ‚Äúfree world‚Äù will stand all fronts against the fight for justice, to the bitter end.",
      "3": "How does a lack of education lead one to believe Putin that there are Nazis in Ukraine, when their President is Jewish?",
      "4": "For the time being all attention is towards Israel Hamas war. No one is thinking of this long going game when new game has started. Thanks üëç",
      "5": "If the people of Ukraine are lucky, the western globalists will start supporting Israel instead, and the Kiev Nazis will have to surrender. It‚Äôs time Russia got what was theirs out of the hands of the Nazis, and people stopped dying for nothing. Unfortunate for the people of Palestine, though. Not all of them are terrorists, but most have been terrorized by Israel.",
      "6": "Most likely it won't have any effect.",
      "7": "Europe and the US have never supported Ukrainian Nazis. They do support the democratically elected government of Ukraine in repelling the invasion of their country by a hostile power (and possible paymaster of the OP), Russia.\nIn the US, I it might provide a way to pass funding for both conflicts by tying both together. But that depends if the Republicans can find enough unity to re-open the House of Representitives. If people feel strongly enough about supporting the conflicts, it could put pressure on their representatives to find a compromise and move forward.",
      "8": "Just look at how Zelenskyy is pathetically trying to hijack the Israel narrative- that tells me he‚Äôs shaking in his boots. Every chance he gets, Zelenskyy shamelessly injects himself into the Israel conflict. ‚ÄúWe stand with Israel, so don‚Äôt forget about us! We‚Äôre still fighting!‚Äù\nAlamo, this is Quora, so you will see a bunch of spammers from Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Disinformation saying that it won‚Äôt affect support for Ukraine at all. If that‚Äôs the case, why are you so worried? Again, look at Zelenskyy‚Äôs behavior, and supporters of Ukraine. They‚Äôre desperate, isolated and alone at the mercy of Russia‚Ä¶",
      "9": "If the hot phase of the conflict lasts long enough, Israel will need massive financial and military assistance from the United States. Because Israeli military doctrine does not provide for long wars.\nEven if this is a short conflict, conflicts should be expected in other US client countries. Therefore, it will be necessary to strengthen support in these places too.\nAccordingly, the share of aid to Ukraine will be slightly reduced anyway.\nMeanwhile, there is real evidence of arms supplies from Ukraine to Hamas.",
      "10": "Demented moron Biden says it won't, but he is more full of shit than his diaper. And so is his asswipe Austin. Pentagon begged to differ, but they just changed their tune since then.\nBesides, CNN tells you to look at Gaza now and forget about Ukraine. Let's wait and see what the US Congress has to say.

    "title": "Does religion exist if theres scientific evidence supporting evolution",
    "answers": {
      "1": "‚Äúif there's scientific evidence supporting evolution?‚Äù\nOh yeah, there‚Äôs evidence.\nAnd yes, for better and worse - like marriage - religion apparently exists while fictional father figures and creationism don‚Äôt. Some people are still in denial about it. Like the last election. Dumbasses.",
      "2": "If you religion depends upon denying the facts of life, your religion exists only in the minds of fools who chose ignorance over honesty.\nWhat God is served by lies?",
      "3": "There‚Äôs scientific proof supporting evolution already. Many people don‚Äôt find it contradictory.",
      "4": "Religion exists even if it is founded on an erroneous belief in gods.",
      "5": "Religion is simply ‚Äòworshiping (a god)‚Äô. It makes no difference whether the god is real or not (obviously).\nWe‚Äôve got Catholics worshiping Jesus-\nwe‚Äôve got Muslims worshiping Allah, and both Catholicism & Islam are very real religions, and the followers of both have very real beliefs, but neither worships a real god.\nReligion is all about belief - not gods.\nScience proved evolution is correct 30 odd yrs ago. And let‚Äôs not forget that we‚Äôve been proving the Bible (& Quarn - same thing) is false, wrong & misleading ever since it was first completed 1624 years ago.\nSo it makes no difference what science discovers, or if it proves gods don‚Äôt exist. Because religious people already believe in something (a god) while nothing even suggets that such a thing (gods) might exist. So their belief is alreadly irrational, and telling them ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve proved human evolution so we‚Äôve proved your God is a load or crap‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make their beliefs any more irrational.\nA delusion kind of ‚Äòdisguises‚Äô parts of reality to create the ‚Äòspace‚Äô for it to survive in. It kind of blanks out (ignores/censors) bit‚Äôs of reality that might ‚Äòwound‚Äô the delusion. So whether they are ‚Äònot recognising‚Äô the fact that they have absolutely nothing to justify having beliefs (in God); or they are ‚Äònot recognising‚Äô new scientific discoveries that prove God did none of the things the Bible claims He did - makes no difference to them. It just their delusions defence mechanisms protecting itself by simply not hearing what‚Äôs said (or wriiten).\nEver noticed when tying to explain some aspect of science to a christian on Quora (something that his delusion would consider ‚Äòharmful‚Äô) and it ends up being a one or two posts per day type of ‚Äòdebate‚Äô; and every second day you have to explain the exact same point, the exact same way that you‚Äôve explained it three times previously. That‚Äôs because that information didn‚Äôt make it to the part of the brain that thinks about stuff or remembers stuff. That info will float around in their short term memory for a while (6 min or so) but it‚Äôs alreadly been ‚Äòcategorised‚Äô as garbage and not worth bothering with. And the next day they ask you the exact same thing, to which you copy/past your previous answer. And two day later they ask again. This is the result of their delusion protecting itself, which leaves little black spots in their recollection of the past events (all that science shit you explained - twice). Not unlike the way bad drunks can have ‚Äòblack spots‚Äô in the recollections.\nAnd all this is of course the consequences of psychologically coercing (aka brainwashing) young children into believing some mythical god is actually real.\nYou think we‚Äôd have written some human rights type laws to protect the most vulnerable humans on the planet from such depraved acts by now.",
      "6": "Evolution has nothing to do with any religion. It make a mess of their fantasy novels, but ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is actually separate from the plagiarized fantasies they are based on.",
      "7": "Evolution is not Atheistic ..it is Agnostic. So yes it can coexist in a God made universe. The old adage .. ‚Äú God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform ‚Äú covers that line. There are noted clerical philosophers and scientists who have attempted to reconcile the undoubted scientific evidence of Evolution and the Ascent of Man, with a God derived plan ‚Ä¶ Theilhard DeChardin a French Jesuit for instance.",
      "8": "Does religion exist if there's scientific evidence supporting evolution?\nFirst of all, there IS overwhelming evidence that evolution is real. Secondly, religion also evolves and has evolved ‚Äî think, animism to polytheism to monotheism to love theism (we aren‚Äôt quite there yet).\nThe existence of religion is obvious since most people on earth have religion. I think the main reason religion exists is because we all die, and science cannot explain what happens next. Empirical research cannot penetrate the veil after death. Most non-theists deny that there is an afterlife because really there is no other option for them: you are born, you live, you die and then nothing. Pretty cool, eh?\nThe fact of evolution is actually a cool thing, and it is revelatory as well. It requires that the Old Testament ‚Äî specifically early Genesis ‚Äî becomes allegorical. Jesus mentioned Eden and Noah and Jonah, but that doesn‚Äôt mean those narratives were historical or factual. Nor do we have to dismiss myths as not having use. Jesus‚Äô audience never heard of evolution. They had no evolutionary context to use in their reasoning. Actually, even the concept of evolution has evolved since Darwin.\nI, as a believer in Jesus, regard evolutionary understanding as a blessing. It tells us a whole lot more about what God is like. I also believe that the evolutionary paradigm is going to end. Jesus‚Äô appearance did not end evolution but rather signified that it would become obsolete. It had its function in the development of the human being as the ‚Äúreplica/image of God‚Äù. Once achieved, there is nowhere else to go. And even if there were to be a technological, transhuman singularity, most of the historical humans are already dead and gone. Where did they go? Only theology can tackle that question and often misses it.\nOnly religion can access the discussion of the afterlife, and, really, Jesus is the principal source of that information. Of course, to access that information, one has to access Jesus. All other ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is looking for love in all the wrong places. I hate to sound so didactic about this, but I have to be honest. Jesus is it. He is the singularity, and it is for everyone. He is the ‚Äútheory of everything.‚Äù He is the UFO that the government isn‚Äôt hiding. God the extra-terrestrial visits us to tell us something truly monumental.",
      "9": "Evolution doesn‚Äôt disprove God, even Charlie boy was shaken up for some reason on his death bed.\nIf anything it proves humanity doesn‚Äôt have the patience to comprehend God.\nI mean could you wait and observe billions of years? Occasionally reach out to a few people you like? Watch imbeciles use you as a tool for their own self interests? Observe atrocities and do nothing, knowing if you did something now the whole world would swicheroo and claim the universe is a fake ass simulation using us as batteries to empower immortal machines in the first universe? Like some kinda turbo nihilism from a bad science fiction movie? Mankind vs Machines 2.0?\nI liked the gnostic impression of the Demiurge looking at the universe and thinking, ek there is some really evil shit going on here. And that‚Äôs the demiurge, who was quick to tell me there is no God above him, Y‚Äôknow, the cliche testing one‚Äôs faith and merit thing that occasionally happens to peculiar individuals.",
      "10": "Does religion exist if there's scientific evidence supporting evolution?\nScience is the study of Creation.\nReligion is the study of the Creator\nJohn 1:1\n.",
      "11": "Religion is a human response to God. It‚Äôs built into the human psyche. As long as there are humans, there will be religion. Science is not about religion or spiritual matters. Science deals with what can be observed and measured. This does not mean there is no spiritual side to the universe, only that science does not have any tools to observe or measure such spiritual properties and cannot make any conclusions about them. If someone feels otherwise, I suspect they are misunderstanding science and believing in scientism, which is the unscientific belief that there is only a physical side to the universe and no spiritual side. Scientism is a belief that is not based on facts or observations, not unlike many religions.",
      "12": "Obviously‚Ä¶ This is a very tedious question‚Ä¶ It has been answered many times..\nOn what basis is there even a conflict between religion in general and evolution..?

    "title": "Will Ukraine attack deeply into Russia like Doolittle s raid in Tokyo Doolittle didn t damage much but caused a lot of resources to suddenly be spent in defense and also showed they were vulnerable it",
    "answers": {
      "1": "No. They want to use their resources to destroy Russian assets being used to invade their country. While a bomb or two on Moscow might feel good, it would not help in their defense of Ukraine.\nBetter use their assets to hit airbases, ammunition depots, fuel depots, bridges, and other targets used to wage war against Ukraine.\nTheir strategy is working. They should not deviate from it.",
      "2": "Ukraine just carried out their own Doolittles‚Äô raid near Belgorod.\nAftermath of the Belgorod raid\nIt didn‚Äôt take long for Ukrainians to take the spotlight from Russians yet again. Following the capture of Bakhmut, Ukrainians needed to do something to put the worlds‚Äô attention squarely on themselves again and had 500 Russian volunteers who fight in Ukraine carry out a daring cross-border raid near the Russian city of Belgorod. They reportedly took four settlements and provoked a massive response by the Russian military.\nMilitarily the raid was insignificant. The raiders took a few captives and captured some equipment, one Mi-8 fell out of the sky, dozens of other helicopters were engaged to shell positions. A few houses were destroyed by the shelling, but overall the military result is minor. Politically however it is a bombshell. Ukrainian forces attacked Russian soil and took several Russian villages, evacuations were carried out, full scale military response followed.\nThe most likely result is Russia will have to heavily reinforce border regions to deterr such attacks from happening. This is because their military can only afford to fall into the septic pit so many times before people begin to notice the smell. The result of the raid will be a continous drain on Russian resources as they now need to deploy considerably more forces in useless defence, not to protect anything important from damage, but to prevent losing face at home.\nJust like the Doolittle raid, in other words.",
      "3": "I never heard of the Russian Freedom Legion (Did I get that right?) before. Though I may not have remembered their exact name, now I know they exist. Multiplied tens of million-fold, that is their accomplishment. The world now knows that at least some Russians inside Russia have risen up and taken back a piece of their country. Now we have a hope we didn‚Äôt dream of a week ago.",
      "4": "It would be both less shocking, and also much more dangerous. Japan wasn‚Äôt a nuclear armed state, Russia is, and one of Russia‚Äôs clearly expressed red lines regarding use of nuclear arms, are substantial threats to core Russian territory. Sure that would result in Russia also getting nuked, but a general nuclear exchange would be an unimaginable tragedy for pretty much everyone in the Northern Hemisphere, and that‚Äôs a best case scenario.",
      "5": "Most likely not.\nUkraine right now is the victim of an invasion. They have Russian troops on their soil, blasting their western cities to rubble, torturing and murdering their captives, and terrorizing the Ukrainian population with missiles. The Russian populace as a whole is beginning to learn more about the costs of this war as bodies either return home or sons suddenly stop writing/calling. The Russian economy is shrinking.\nThis all puts Ukraine on the moral high ground. They are defending their homes and country against a gang of thugs more intent on criminality than actual military action. The world sees what Russia is doing and supports Ukraine.\nIf Ukraine brings the war to Russia‚Äôs territory, popular support for the war increases against the ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù. They now will have invaded Russia and become aggressors instead of defenders. It‚Äôs a lot harder for the West to donate weapons and materiel to invaders.\nAll in all, although there would be some psychological benefit, Zelenskyy is above everything else no fool. He knows that as long as he‚Äôs fighting in Ukraine the country stands a chance. Staging a deep raid risks too much to make it worth the risk. (And I wonder if Ukraine has any spare comedians available for us come next November. Right now I‚Äôd prefer a Ukrainian comedian to the US clowns declaring their candidacy‚Ä¶)",
      "6": "Yes - these recent partisan incursions increasingly look like a brilliant move.\nRussia has 2300 km of borders with Ukraine. With all their ground troops committed to the ‚ÄúSpecial Operation‚Äù, they have left this vast area virtually undefended.\nThese raids are a deep humiliation for Putin, and are causing chaos in the areas affected.\nNow he will either have to redeploy troops to their borders, opening up gaps on the front lines, or risk further loss of face and disruption in his border Oblasts.\nAnd because the raids were carried out by Russian partisans, they the spectre of civil war within the Federation - something that strikes deep at the Russian psyche.\nSo Putin if being confronted with a lose/loose dilemma: leave his borders open, or weaken his defences on the 1000 km front line in Ukraine.\nBecause he doesn‚Äôt have anything approaching the resources to defend both effectively.\nPartisans of the Russian Volunteer Corps",
      "7": "There are a number of factors that would need to come into play in order to accurately mimic the Dolittle raid:\nSelect a target that is of great political significance (though not necessarily causing a lot of damage). Incidentally, Ukraine did this already by exploding a UAV at the Kremlin, and at least two UAVs at a Russian airfield north of Ukraine, but for the purposes of this question we‚Äôll keep going over this answer to your question\nThat selected target would have to be too far away for Ukrainian aircraft to make a successful, safe round trip\nThe target must be close enough for friendly territory for those aircraft to either land or ditch\nThe aircraft themselves must be expendable. MiG-29s might fit this bill\nThe aircraft would have to land in friendly territory, and preferably of a nation that is currently at war with Russia. There currently aren‚Äôt any, although you could argue that Georgia might fit this bill because they are presently occupied by Russia. If the Ukrainians landed there, however, there is a high probability Russia would send a large, armed force to capture or kill them, so this would probably not be the best option for Ukraine, the pilots, and Georgia itself. The only other option would be Finland, but as Finland is not technically a party to the conflict the pilots would probably need to be interned for the duration so as to maintain some air of non-partisanship to the conflict. This would deprive Ukraine of a precious resource - pilots - that it so desperately needs.\nThis then begs the following question: let‚Äôs say, in light of all of the above, Ukraine decides to execute such a raid. What would be the optimal target?\nSt. Petersburg\nNote the scale at the bottom-right of the image. It‚Äôs something like 100 miles from St. Petersburg to the Finnish border\nNailing St. Petersburg would scare the living shit out of the Kremlin, and especially in light of the fact that Ukraine recently received dozens of MiG-29s donated to them by European nations, so they could spare the loss of aircraft. They can also spare them in light of the fact they‚Äôre almost certainly going to receive F-16s this summer.\nHowever, given the distance from Ukraine to St. Petersburg\nIt‚Äôs not likely that this is even possible. Now Wikipedia is telling me that it might be possible with a single drop tank (ferry distance of 1100 miles with a single drop tank), but that would involve a long, dangerous trip over the airspace of two enemy nations. They would also need to carry weapons for the trip that would do enough damage for it to matter. Two pairs of MiG-29s armed, with, a pair of air-to-air missiles and some rockets for ground targets could do the trick, but the additional weight and drag would really tax that fuel supply. We‚Äôre talking about going about somewhere around 900 miles, with an 1100-mile max range with a single drop tank and maximum fuel load, so that‚Äôs a tall order on top of going over mostly hostile territory. Belarus might not look too kindly on having their airspace violated, either, but whatever‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre already letting Russian troops stage from their soil, so it‚Äôs not like Lukashenko is blameless.\nFinally, there is the discussion of optimal targets in St. Petersburg. If I had to pick one that is very visible and symbolic, that would be either the Russian naval base there or the governor‚Äôs palace. The governor‚Äôs palace would probably be the better targets as far as political optics are concerned, but there‚Äôs a large chance of civilian casualties. That‚Äôs not something that is in Ukraine‚Äôs best interests. The next best target would be the naval base, but with advanced warning they could fire up the anti-aircraft radars and weapons of those ships. Probably better to go for that governor‚Äôs palace, then, and blame it on collateral damage, but even that is a tough sell owing to the still-close proximity of those military assets.\nShort answer: is it possible? Yes. Is it going to happen? Almost certainly not.\nBut maybe if someone makes a fiction film about it someday‚Ä¶some brave Ukrainian general, seeing his homeland soaked in blood and in flames from invasion by a malignant, foreign power, might look to this example from days of yore and feel inspired enough to make it happen‚Ä¶ and succeed. I would put this idea on part with historical fiction like Das Boot, but that might be a stretch‚Ä¶",

      "9": "Ukrainians have already done their Doolittle raid on Crimea which Russia regards as Russian. Half naked Russian tourists were sent fleeing in terror from the beach. Their experience was shared on Russian social media and could not be hidden from the Russian public. The impact in Russian moral was huge but unlike the Doolittle raid the military impact of blowing up nemerous aircraft and an amunition dump were also huge.\nBut before the Crimea attack there have been attacks in Belgarod and sabotage of factories all over Russia but the Russian public have not been told about it or they've been described as\naccidents\nPrior to the Doolittle raid there was the Berlin raid. Earlybinbthecwar when RAF airfields were being attacked Hitler boasted that the RAF would never bomb Berlin. So Churchill sent a squadron of Lancaster bombers over to Berlin with the intention of goading Hitler into bombing London in order to stop the bombing of RAF bases. This ploy worked, had the Germans concentrated on bombing the airfields instead of London they probably would have won.",

Ukraine needs to carefully select the targets with the most bang for the buck.",
      "12": "So far Ukraine has been restraining their attacks into Russia to surgical military targets close to the border of Ukraine. As you said a deep incursion into Russia would be a serious psychological shock to Putin‚Äôs myth of ‚Äúlimited military operation‚Äù.

Engaging a past super-armed and war-trained super power is not in anyone‚Äôs best interest.\nUkrainians will not admit easily, but there are a lot of people both sides of border with mixed Ukrainian-Russian heritage. Putin controlled media has sown very deep hatred in many Russian hearts. They condemn Ukrainians as really low grade people racially now. But that can change and heal a bit given time.\nRussia will collapse on its own with economic sanctions and isolation from Europe. Already, the demand for their oil is collapsing and I suspect Oil prices will drop too."

      "6": "In modern times, U.S. soldiers are not allowed to take spoils of war. This practice is prohibited by international laws and treaties, as well as U.S. military regulations. Let's break it down:\nInternational Laws and Treaties: The Geneva Conventions and other international agreements strictly forbid the looting and pillaging of property, including personal belongings, cultural artifacts, or anything else, during wartime. These rules are in place to protect civilians and their property during conflicts.\nU.S. Military Regulations: The United States military has its own set of rules and regulations, which are in alignment with international laws. U.S. soldiers are trained to follow these rules, which include respecting the property and rights of civilians, even in a war zone. Taking spoils of war would violate these regulations and can lead to disciplinary actions.\nCultural and Ethical Standards: Beyond the legal and military aspects, taking spoils of war is generally considered unethical and goes against the values upheld by the U.S. military. Soldiers are taught to uphold a high standard of moral and ethical conduct, which includes respecting the property and rights of others.\nAccountability: In modern conflicts, there is a strong emphasis on accountability. Soldiers are aware that their actions can be scrutinized, and violations of the rules can lead to criminal charges, including war crimes. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to follow the laws and regulations.\nIt's important to note that the rules and regulations regarding the conduct of soldiers in wartime have evolved over time, with a greater emphasis on protecting civilians and their property. While the historical concept of \"spoils of war\" may have existed in ancient times, it is not acceptable or legal in modern warfare. The focus today is on following the laws and rules that safeguard human rights and minimize the suffering of those affected by armed conflicts.",

    "title": "Why were large backpacks ubiquitous of modern soldiers not used by soldiers of the WWII era",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Because modern soldiers don‚Äôt really use those backpacks.\nA modern soldier\nThose large rucksacks you see carried by soldiers are meant to carry all of their personal belongings when they are deploying from one area to another.\nSoldiers preparing to deploy to a different area\nWhen they are actually in combat, soldiers carry way smaller rucksacks that only contain items essential to the mission.\nSoldiers in combat. Note the small rucksacks they carry as opposed to the larger ones seen earlier.\nThis was also the case during WW2, where soldiers would use larger rucksacks to carry all of the personal belongings when they were deployed to the theatres of war.\nWW2 soldiers deploying\nAnd when they entered combat, these soldiers would trade their larger rucksacks for smaller and more portable ones too.\nWW2 soldiers deploying to combat. Once again, note the smaller rucksacks\nAnd even if your question were talking about modern-day soldiers carrying large field packs for extended patrols, the sizes of the pack were, in fact, comparable in size.\nWW2 Field pack\nModern field pack\nHence, WW2 soldiers carried equipment there were of comparable size to those carried by modern-day soldiers,\nThat‚Äôs all folks!",
      "2": "They didn‚Äôt exist.\nBackpacks are not new things, they‚Äôve existed for at least 4 Millenia. The modern heavy load hauler though is an incredibly complex design with quite a bit of tech in it.\nWhen I joined the Boy Scouts my first pack was my grandfathers hand me down from WW2, or rather the one he was issued around 1949. It was the flat rucksack with metal buckles, 3 slip dividers and hemp straps with no padding. At 12 I was almost as big as Grandpa.\nI essentially carried a similar load out to that era‚Äôs soldiers. A wool blanket, GI Issue, a poncho, the flat aluminum mess kit, some food, a hexamine fuel stove, socks and a canteen on a belt. It was surprisingly heavy and not at all comfortable. The straps in particular dug in.\nI also had the full ‚ÄúH‚Äù harness but didn‚Äôt normally carry that since unlike those GIs I didn‚Äôt have to carry a rifle, spare mags and grenades.\nSo here is your first answer, weight.\nThe early military gear is freaking heavy. Especially that blanket. But the helmets were made of steel. The E-tool and breaching gadgets and weapons and what not were also kinda beefy. Today these things weigh half as much sometimes. Only guns, ammo and grenades are still really heavy.\nWhen I went on my first real long range hike, I upgraded to an old Kelty frame pack. Same stuff, much easier to carry and I added a pup tent and a foam pad. With lots of room to spare.\nToday soldiers carry bulkier gear. The modular sleep system with a bivy sack is heavier by a bit than the wool blanket but ultimately warmer and can keep you drier. It takes up twice the actual volume though. The ponchos are lighter now but not any smaller. The poncho liner, or woobie, is much lighter than a wool blanket but packs bigger. Guys now have computers, comm gear, AP mines and other shaped explosives added in.\nThey need that space.\nThere has been a huge difference in military doctrine though. Mobility. Today, most soldiers are vehicle mounted to a large degree. Everyone other than certain ‚Äúlight infantry‚Äù are heavily vehicle supported and oddly the light infantry guys carry more weight in their packs.\nToday‚Äôs big campaign packs aren‚Äôt actually carried like a recreational thru hiker. They get dumped into trucks, dragged onto helicopters, left in armored carriers. Service members dismount without a pack to engage.\nToday you carry a ‚Äúpatrol pack‚Äù which isn‚Äôt much larger than my old surplus pack for when you go out on patrol. It looks bigger because of the frame and the materials involved. They are actually lighter though.\nWooden frame packs existed in WW2, the Russians used them. The US really didn‚Äôt because infantry was deployed differently then than today. Back then you made an assault, dug in and waited for resupply, while prepping for a counterattack. The Russians didn‚Äôt have that advantage. They practiced a scorched earth slow retreat while bleeding the NAZIs and resupply was scarce. That was the point so they carried what they could.\nEven today, soldiers tend to ditch everything they evaluate to be unnecessary or superfluous, to the point that they are made to carry certain things. That‚Äôs always been true I think. Heavy is heavy.\nThe big 7500 cubic inch (120 l) campaign bag isn‚Äôt quite as ubiquitous as civilians might think. The standard issue packs vary more today but are generally one size fits all and smaller. Infantry guys buy their own gear now sometimes to get things that carry better.\nSome of this is visual though. Modern packs that are actually big have pretty complex frames. My great uncle was Army Airborne in WW2 and he actually had a big pack but it was basically frameless and didn‚Äôt look as big. He seldom talks about the war, but he talks about that heavy damn bag.\nFinally there is the big difference.\nMoney.\nToday we sink significantly more money into troops, per capita, than we did back then. Troops have much more stuff. Especially true in US and NATO Forces. In WW2 there wasn‚Äôt always enough stuff to go around. Today, there is backups for the backups.\nThe idea in WW2 that regular troops would have night vision, weapon scopes, comprehensive snivel gear, personal blowout kits, sleep pads, satellite communicatios etc. would have seemed like a joke. Back then keeping them in bullets and food was a pretty big achievement. We had lots of jeeps and a good many tanks but keeping them fueled up was a challenge. That‚Äôs still an issue but only because modern forces can move so fast.\nToday the US Military is the greatest logistics operation in history. The big bags are just an element of that, troops that, theoretically, should never run out of anything.",

      "4": "Pic: Embarking for So.France invasion\nIn 1943, we returned from action at Monte Casino. We were stationed outside of Salerno, Italy and in training for the invasion of Anzio and Southern France.\nAbove pic shows our embarkation for the latter.\nDaily, we climbed a mountain adjacent to Mt. Vesuvius,carrying our normal equipment plus either a case of rations or a 5 gallon can of water‚Ä¶total weight about 85 pounds. One day, we were privileged to witness Vesuvius erupt, and find huge amounts of ash littering the streets of Salerno when we descended from our training climb.\n. On the invasion of France, I carried the following: a haversack containing 3 days each of C,D and K rats; Rifle,ammo belt, 5 bandoliers of ammo,7 frag grenades , shelter half; tent stake, blanket; 2 canteens of water;\n2 or 3 packs cigarettes; mess kit; first aid kit; combat knife or bayonet ; flashlight; a. German knife fork spoon set;\nraincoat; extra socks; entrenching tool; ; a WP grenade; a book ( also served as toilet paper as the pages were read) . Also carried 2 Bangalore Torpedo, large wire cutters and a gas mask. Much of this was discarded soon after the landing. This totaled about the same 85 lbs we had used in the aforementioned training . The cartoons are apropos. Enjoy!",
      "5": "Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I assume that those large backpacks mean something like this:\n(And it depends on how you define the word ‚Äúlarge‚Äù)\nAmerican\nOr this\nBritish\nOr this\nRussian\nWhy our glorious WW2 soldiers didn‚Äôt equip themselves with those ‚Äúlarge backpacks‚Äù? Simple reasons: expensive and unnecessary.\nWW2 was a global war of attrition, it was all about mass production, cost control and user-friendly. A nation at that time needed to spend money on anything useful for a war, and those backpacks occupied just a very small proportion of those equipment. Still, a nation needed at least hundreds of thousands of them for their soldiers to pack the stuff they need to combat. Extra ammo,combat rations, poncho, maybe some spare batteries for radios, a very simple first-aid kit, mess kit, clothes for changing, wool sleeping bag and water bottle are the things that a soldier would pack in their bags (they will save some space for their own stuff as well). Some of the mentioned items may just be attached on belt rather than putting inside the bag. A super huge bag like a MOLLE backpack would be too much for a soldier in WW2. Also, soldiers seldom put their ammo, explosive, gas mask, combat knife ,E-tool and everything else that always require immediate use during engagement inside the backpack, especially for a MOLLE-type of deep backpack which it takes time to find things from it. (If these backpacks would have been used in WW2, I am pretty sure that the NCOs would order their guys to pack them full with mortar rounds, ammo belt, explosives, batteries, fuels and rations, which they might get exhausted far before getting into a combat) Large backpacks would be meaningless for them.\nFor most of the soldiers in WW2, they didn‚Äôt have to fight in double coincidence condition with extreme climate and terrain where logistic supply could not be linked with the combat units. Military logistics was expected to follow closely behind the troops, which soldiers would expect:\nA hot chow near the field kitchen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not a full pack of C rations\nField hospitals with pretty nurses rather than exhausted medics with a huge bag of medical tools\nWhat I mean is that soldiers will never count on a backpack to do everything for them.\nBesides, backpacks in WW2 were rather simple design, as they were expected to be wasted from battle to battle (just like soldiers‚Ä¶). Here are some examples:\nUS Army M1928 Haversack\nBritish Pattern 37 Backpack\nGerman Rucksack Model 1941\nUSSR M41‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Backpack?\nFrench MLE 35 Backpack (It is so rare and hard to find a uploadable photo‚Ä¶)\nJapanese Taisho Horsehair Rucksack\nChinese backpack‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.looks like a German-trained elite trooper‚Äôs backpack, it was an absolute luxury for a Chinese soldier.\nThey look nothing fancy or ‚Äúlarge‚Äù. They are just some medium-sized, reliable, easy to use, and simple designs, which none of them are made of advanced materials, just canvas, artificial leather and equipped with metal hooks and buttons. They are not specifically designed for waterproof or fireproof, but they are tough enough for soldiers to quickly cross a short river or a burning village. The most important thing is that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..THEY ARE CHEAP!!!\nWell, governments in WW2 won‚Äôt spend a lot on infantry‚Äôs equipment like backpacks, so their soldiers won‚Äôt carry a MOLLE for extra burden in return. Once those bags were good for their jobs, no soldiers would bother themselves with a larger backpack.",
      "6": "All good answers, noting that when equipment got better and creature comforts more available, the packs got bigger. The exception may be jungle warfare, where pack size enters the equation in pushing through bamboo, vines and low branches.\nThis photo was taken by an Army photographer in an advance to contact following an Indonesian army rifle company incursion into Sarawak in 1964\nI‚Äôm on the right, using a 37 Pattern webbing pack. Inside are five days of rations, under my mess tin. On top of the pack is my poncho, rolled over a pair of sneakers, spare shirt, socks and underwear. As food was eaten the poncho contents were transferred inside the pack. Other equipment on the webbing belt included a water bottle, map case, bayonet and rope toggle. In my 37 Pattern web pouches were two 36 grenades, extra Bren magazines (they fit the SLR and offered thirty rounds instead of twenty) and a personal 9mm Luger, for prisoner control and house clearing.\nUpon see signs of the enemy in close proximity the lead scout would drop his pack and continue on. Each of us, on passing the pack, now knew that the enemy were nearby. A rifleman in the third section would shoulder the lead scout‚Äôs pack and carry it onward. It might be a challenge today for one man to carry two modern packs and still be ready for action.\nEvery five days we had a helicopter RV and food supply. This resupply continued for as long as the mission required. The longest was six weeks, by which time our shirts and underwear were burnt - not laundered - on return to base, as the stitching had begun to rot.\nThe 58 Pattern webbing had been issued for European service by this time but was considered too bulky for jungle service. The GPMG was also available, but belt feed weapons are a challenge in close cover and we stuck to our Bren LMGs.\nGreat days!",
      "7": "Several reasons. You can find a number of good answers here, but in addition the soldiers of that era were physically smaller AND high mobility was not as much of a priority in most units then as it is today. Today, you take it with you when you go. The philosophy was different.\nBack then, while armor units carried everything with them and could move fast, mech- infantry, armored cavalry, and airmobile infantry didn‚Äôt really exist, so infantry units would take ground, dig-in, and wait for the counter attacks and resupply. When the soldiers moved on an enemy position, they‚Äôd carry the minimum they needed-to to get by until the resupply trains caught up with them. Outrunning your supply trains was a problem. Even for the armored units. Patton‚Äôs single biggest problem in moving forward was having his fuel supplies keep up with him.\nToday soldiers can move their equipment most of the time in vehicles, so you can carry most of what you need with you, and when you have to truck it using your footabakers, it is usually for a comparatively short distance.\nAnd, of course, special ops of various types (even LRRPs) are much more common today, and they are often situationally not conducive to easy resupply‚Ä¶.. so in those kinds of operations, if you don‚Äôt carry it in, you‚Äôre likely to not have it at all.",
      "8": "Mostly because instead of Afghanistan and Iraq, where toting large amounts of equipment are necessary because you are far more spread out, the warfare is more 3D. It‚Äôs not like ‚Äúthe west is our side and the East is enemy territory.‚Äù\nInstead, Coalition forces are stuck in FOBS or Firebases or whatever they are called now. The enemy is all around them, patrols are common and there is no progress or territory gained that can be marked on a map. Therefore, a soldier needs far more ammo and gear, because although supply can come in through air and land routes, they are still surrounded by the country.\nSo they need more ammo and gear because if they don‚Äôt have it they are more susceptible to being cut off.\nCompared to most Allied and Axis powers who always had a route open for supply. That‚Äôs why the average infantrymen in WW2 was less bulked down. Even BAR and Bren gun carriers, which were light machine guns, were less packed out than a average coalition riflemen today.\nvs:\nOf course, better medical supplies and bigger rations (MRE‚Äôs) make the load out bigger as well as body armor plates, but still they have far more ammo and supplies than the average ww2 infantrymen.",
      "9": "Large sacks were worn in WWI even though it was not used in WWII. What was the greatest difference of the two wars. Vehicles and transport. The main transportation in WWI was the railroad and train. However, this was a very limited way as you can not set up this type of network in big forests or jungles, enemy territory areas. So instead of putting all the food, ammunition, or clothings on the train, each soldier had to carry them by themselves. This method was used through out mankind history of war.\nHowever, in WWII great amount of transportation such as car, trucks, and tanks (not typically a transportation but you can call if you wish) made and faster and more elaborate planes were built. This enabled the soldiers to carry less food, clothings, but to carry more ammunition and practical stuff such as well‚Ä¶ ammunition! So you can see WWII soldiers carrying load and loads of ammunition around their belt, around their shoulders, on each side of their body and having grenades dangling on your shoulders like this.\nThis is very compared to those of WWI or the first modern war, the Franco Prussian War because a common French soldier would wear a uniform with a huge knapsack like this.\nThe picture is an early WWI French infantry uniform which is almost identical to the Franco Prussian War French uniform.\nTo sum up, the reason why soldiers didn‚Äôt wear large haversacks in WWII is because most of the stuffs that normally soldiers wore in their haversacks like foods, clothes those stuffs were preferred to be carried by trucks and small vehicles not by individual soldier. I hope my reply was a great help.",
      "10": "The soldiers of WWII and previous wars did not benefit from all of the backbreaking ‚Äúlight weight gear‚Äù the modern soldier has to carry. Additionally, the supply for WWII soldiers were far closer to the front lines so that resupply was not a serious problem unless you were surrounded or operating in mountainous or jungle terrain.\nI carried a lot of, ‚Äúlight weight gear,‚Äù because I usually operated in denied or remote locations where resupply was either impossible or ‚Äúiffy‚Äù at best. If a man were incapacitated, (wounder or dead), you had to take his load and distribute it to the other members of the already burdened team. We often talked about caches for equipment not immediately needed but then you would need to leave two men to watch it, (to report compromise or booby traps) - better to have more trigger pullers present than cans of beans stored at a remote location.\nNot mentioned is the greatly expanded expanse of the battlefields of today compared to WWII. While not nearly cramped as WWI, WWII still saw company and platoons working together in bodies. Today, the feeling of wanting to be close to your buddy is replaced by a desire to keep your distance in order to avoid attracting enemy fire.",
      "11": "They were.\nAmerican WWII haversack M1928 model\nBritish Commando Style Backpack\nGerman Haversack\nJapanese Haversack.\nAll of these are examples and were worn frequently. They were used almost all days of the week, and they contained clothes, food, extra water, socks and hell, sometimes even a bloody tent.\nHowever, they were not used on the battlefield. They were heavy, bulky and they slowed you down in a time when trucks didn‚Äôt cross a battlefield and APCs didn‚Äôt exist. Because they slowed the troops down, they were left at the rear.\nAll the ammunition needed was carried in pouches and pockets. Nobody actually is going to change socks in the middle of a battle, are they?\n- James",
      "12": "You must first understand why does a soldier carry such large backpacks.\nIt is common to see these days, Executives carrying a briefcase and strolly, even when going out for a day. This is in spite of the fact that he may be staying in a fully furnished hotel room,with food, linen, towels and toiletries.\nA soldier moves out to Godforsaken places for indefinite duration, climatic and living conditions. He is not even sure of his next meal. During WWII, my Grandfather returned home after 4 years.\nSo, the soldier has to carry his entire household,on his back. He did it centuries back, during the WWs and now. With modernisation, the quality may have changed but quantity gets added.\nThe web equipment, digging tools etc, during WW II used to be of heavy material, now it is lighter.\nIn an attack, he sheds all this at the Assembly Line, so you may have seen some pictures of soldiers lightly equipped.\nHave you ever wondered what does it all contain? To give a picture - his weapon with its ammunition, spare magazines with ammunition, a few grenades, compass, map, binoculars, a small digging tool, a ground sheet or bivouac, blanket, towel, poncho, mosquito net, tiffin, mug, toiletries, a set of change, water bottle, survival ration, pull through and a few more such items.\nIn addition, he may be allotted part of some special equipment which is large and apportioned between soldiers. All this is in addition to what he‚Äôs wearing, including a Bullet Proof Jacket, Helmet, Boots etc..\nI am already sweating trying to remember the list.\nSoldiering is tough.Ironically, only another soldier can understand it. For a civilian, he‚Äôs Rambo, shooting all around, without any logistics and worrying only about his millions.",
      "13": "Historically, as firepower on the battlefield has increased, so too has dispersion on the battlefield. Troops today are more spread out. So the area that a modern infantry battalion occupies is much larger than the one occupied by soldiers of WWII and they need to carry more provisions. Firepower is not just the sum of weapons carried (which are far superior today) but also of force multipliers such as indirect fire weapons (mortars & artillery) and air support. Back in WWII, radio communication was terrible. Today‚Äôs satellite and digital communication systems as well as identify friend or foe systems clear up a lot of the ‚Äúfog of war.‚Äù In WWII friendly fire was all too common. Toss in squad deployed drones that can see the enemy at greater distances, and the need to cover more area with fewer troops increases. Soldiers of the WWII era had no such things, very poor communication and less coordinated firepower, so they couldn‚Äôt deploy too far from main units.\nCheers.",
      "14": "Soldiers in WW2 didn‚Äôt carry nearly as much equipment as modern soldiers. They didn‚Äôt have night vision goggles, water bladders, advanced trauma kits, secondary weapon systems or many of the advanced military gear that soldiers are expected to carry now. However, in the US military the Mountain Division was in fact using a large backpack to carry additional gear and provisions.\nThis is the backpack that was available to the Mountain Division (as well as any other soldiers who desired one) at the beginning of WW2. Simply called the ‚ÄúRucksack‚Äù, this and the three refinements that followed were a simple canvas pack with a few outside pouches and a steel frame in the back to maintain it‚Äôs shape while worn. These packs lacked the waist and chest straps on today‚Äôs packs and were definitely not as comfortable to carry.\nIt saw few changes during the Korean War, as a smaller M1945 pack was sufficient for soldiers in that campaign when combined with the new load distribution gear that added a wide belt and shoulder straps to a soldier‚Äôs gear, from which pouches containing their gear could be attached rather than all stored in their pack.\nThe beginning of the Vietnam war saw the distribution of the MLCE, or M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment. This design was a more efficient than the previous LCE and allowed soliders in Vietnam to carry most of their required gear close to their bodies and within easy reach via pouches that could be positioned by the soldier for their preference.\nNearing the end of the Vietnam War the ALICE or All-Purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment was issued to soldiers. This System combined the belt and shoulder webbing from the MLCE with a sturdy rucksack mounted on a steel frame. This design was created to reduce the load on a soldier‚Äôs back and shoulders to make them tire more slowly during a march. It was also easier to remove than the previous systems, making it easier to drop your pack but not your combat essential gear in an ambush.\nHere‚Äôs the ALICE pack:\nAnd here‚Äôs an ALICE harness complete with canteens and pouches for magazines, grenades and other combat essential gear:\nThe ALICE system stayed in use by the US military until the year 2001, when the modern MOLLE system was first issued to soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. The MOLLE system is the image of modern soldier gear you have today:\nAs you can see, the new MOLLE II rucksack is taller than previous versions, however the perceived weight by the soldier is similar to previous systems under a load, thanks to the new understanding of load distribution and new materials that make the pack durable but much lighter. The ripstop nylon fabric used to make these new packs is much lighter than the thick canvas of the previous versions, and the heavy steel frame has been replaced with a much lighter and ergonomically shaped plastic frame, reducing the weight further.\nSo, the bottom line is that WW2 packs were a bit smaller because they and the gear they carried were heavy, and a soldier couldn‚Äôt carry more than that and still march long distance.",
      "15": "Soldiers in ww2 did not hike or get dropped off by helicopter deep in enemy territory. They stayed as a group and pushed forward as a group. They were seldom far from battalion supply. The exception were airborne troops. They parachuted or landed by glider behind enemy lines. They carried over one hundred pounds of supplies and the famous leg bag which had mines and mortar rounds.",
      "16": "I can only guess, based on my personal experience as an infantryman in Vietnam. We, Infantry, had to carry everything needed to survive for anywhere between a week and to ten days. As I recall, pretty much were resupplied about once each week (more or less). We would get C rations (which were heavy to carry), water,(also heavy) and ammo. Sometimes mail and other assorted ordinance.\nIn the jungle, it was hard to find a practical landing zone for choppers to get to us.\nFor the most part, there were no front lines. As such it made resupply difficult and sometimes impossible. As a result, we had to carry a lot of necessary stuff.\nWWll, for a large part, had a front. The quartermaster corp (I can‚Äôt say enough about how great they were) could get stuff quicker to where it was needed. I‚Äôm surmising, therefore, it may have not been necessary to carry so much.",
      "17": "In addition to what has already been said, the US Army used and when I was in still used an ‚ÄúA‚Äù Bag, ‚ÄúB‚Äù Bag system. As I recall it.\nThe ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù bags were duffel bags upon which the soldier‚Äôs Name and Serial Number would be stenciled. The ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù bags were usually under the control of the company Supply Sergeant and/or Battalion S-4 (Supply and Logistics Section) to the rear of the front line.\nIn theory (if not always in practice); the soldier carried essentials on his back in his pack, depending on the situation, climate, etc. In his backpack he might have a day or two rations, a change or two of underwear - definitely dry socks- and even perhaps an extra pair of pants and blouse, depending. Things like shelter half, poncho, etc. might or not be included, depending again on the situation. The rest of his field gear and field clothing would be packed in his ‚ÄúA‚Äù Bag - which would be brought up once his unit was in a location where it would stay for a time if the tactical situation was stable.\nThe ‚ÄúB‚Äù bag would contain the soldier‚Äôs other issue such as dress uniforms and whatever other personal effects the troop didn‚Äôt want to carry. Usually, the ‚ÄúB‚Äù bag would catch up to the soldier when they were behind the lines in an area where they could get some R & R.\nThis system was designed to do away with the need to carry everything on one‚Äôs back. Even then, when troops were moving to contact with the enemy, usually back packs were ‚ÄúGrounded‚Äù with the promise the troops could come back and get them or supply would bring them up after the battle was over. If one reads the memoirs of WW2 veterans one discovers that often didn‚Äôt happen as the situation developed.\nWhen I was deployed to Grenada in October 1983, my A-bag didn‚Äôt catch up to me until I‚Äôd been home a month. Most of us wore the same uniform the entire time I was there. Actually I remember seeing the pallet with our A-bags on it sitting on the airstrip (I recognized some of the names stenciled on them as I passed) as I boarded the plane home. Nothing‚Äôs perfect.\nAs has been explained, larger packs are carried today because of the nature of the battlefield and all the extra equipment required by individual soldiers. But there always has to be a balance of making sure the soldier has everything he needs to fight the fight against wearing troops out in carrying all that gear over rough terrain to get to the battle. That is why the US Army (and other branches) is always looking for more efficient ways to carry the gear; better, lighter gear that is at the same time durable under the extensive stress of combat (one of the explanations for $400 hammers that gets brought up every so often); and physical conditioning that properly prepares the soldier for combat.",
      "18": "Weight is the primary limiting factor. Size, not so much.\nPrevious generations of load carrying gear was much heavier per litre (or cubic foot) so to keep weight to practical limits, the size of - say - WW2 canvas gear with metal attachments, had to reflect this.\nIt was also then SOP to carry some items external to the pack but either worn or strapped on: blankets, greatcoats, ponchos etc., as that meant easy access (and was faster when depositing marching gear when moving up to the line).\nModern packs (that sometimes seem to approach the scale of small domestic appliances) typically carry items that are also lighter in weight but take up more room:\nHigh-loft sleeping bags, down jackets, tents, clothing, all of it either entirely or mostly man-made fibres. This kind of clothing, shelters, and foam ground rolls (‚Äòkipmats‚Äô) act like the stuffing in a pillow, so when stuffed into a pack the pack looks inflated, but because the packs are about as stretchy as tin plate the result is a backpack that looks like it was pumped full of extreme expandability professional-quality construction grade filler foam‚Ä¶",
      "19": "When I first started backpacking more than 50 years ago I used an army backpack my father was issued during world war 2. It was really nothing more than a small board strapped to your back and didn't distribute weight very well. Equipment has gotten much better.

      "20": "oo The soldiers and marines of ww2 were deployed and supplied quite differently than those of the modern era. The soldier and marine carried only what they needed to servive short term, while the suipply/logistics guys focused on moving supplies to the front. Today‚Äôs battles rarely have ,a front and the individual carries a lot of stuff besides dry socks, first aid kit, water and, ammo. If you had room in your small ‚Äúday‚Äù apack, you might carry extra matches, bandages annd nd, a few cans of C or K rations. During ww2 it wasn‚Äôt unusual for troops to go a couple or more days without food, but they normally carried extra water. As a MARSOC Marine Special Operations Command, Operater, I carried a lot of ammo and frags along with as much water as I could carry quietly. If we believed a lrp would last more than a couple days, we carried enough food for at least a partial meal every day. The regular grunts carried enough to operate without re-supply for three or four days. They tend to carry a lot of water and no where near enough ammoammo. In my pack I carried a poncho, 2 pairs of socks, a pack of wet wipes, 640 rounds of 556, or 120 rounds of 7.62, 400 rnds of 556, 6, frags and 4 liters of water. I carried 2 canteens and a 5 quart hydro pack. A first aid kit, 6 loaded pistol mags, binoculars, nods, 8 loaded rifle mags or 4 loaded 556 mags and 4 loaded 7.62 mags. Give or take a few items depending on the mission. After 1982 We wore ballistic vests with drop in plates. Depending on the mission the plates may stay in camp. We did hunter killer opps where I wore the vest a hydro pack and 640 rounds of ammo. If designated over watch I carried 120 rounds of 7.62. The load changes with each mission. The only guarantee you get is your back and knees are going to hurt.",
      "21": "Civilian gear makers didn‚Äôt really make large framed backpacks until the 1950s (where Kelty made its name). Til then the unframed rucksack or even ‚Äúbedroll‚Äù was standard, but without a frame, a ruck is limited to small loads unless one likes torture. Most of the duffel bags, footlockers, and even large backpacks are moved in the supply trains, depending on what the tactical situation is. We were allowed a 3-day assault pack (rucksack), one duffel bag, and one personal item (usually a soft briefcase containing a PC for computer games, er, .. I mean self-study). Static, operating out of a base for months, is one thing, so the commanders would let troops keep their footlockers. Rolling through the countryside or doing an air assault would be quite another (big bags and lockers stored, 3 day assault packs taken).",
      "22": "Back then they didn't need much. They were expected to die, and what they did need was able to be carried on their main kit. Modern Warfare is significantly different from WW2 era warfare. We have more threats and more equipment to carry nowadays",
      "23": "True, every soldier, airman and sailor I served with on operations all had the huge ruck sack, the smaller backpack, a duffel bag and often up to 3 barrack boxes when we deployed overseas. The kit must have cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of my compatriots used only about 10 to 20 percent of all that kit. The majority of what we deployed with was stuffed under whatever bed space or cot we were assigned to when we landed in country, and that kit was never to be moved until we redeployed back home. We deployed with so much kit.\nThe soldier of WW2 deployed with just the bare essentials necessary to keep him (or her) alive and make them an efficient killing machine. The nations fighting that war had limited budgets and had to equip literally millions of soldiers, sailors and airmen. They were given only what was necessary. And soldiers themselves, for the most part are minimalists, or very quickly become minimalists when they have to carry all that kit with them.\nAlso, today very few soldiers hump it on foot when deployed. I‚Äôm not saying it never happened, but for the most part our combat troops are mechanized and mounted.\nI used to be an armoured officer, although by the time I deployed in my overseas deployments, I was serving as a logistics officer. However during my time as a tanker when I did weeks long training exercises, we only took a a change of clothes, some precious socks and underwear, a toiletry kit, cup, plate, KFS, rifle, ammo, webbing, rain gear, sleeping bag and ground sheet, and everything stuffed into a sleeping bag carrier, and that lasted for weeks. Space in a tank, or infantry fighting vehicle is extremely limited, so you learn to minimize.\nIf you ever see pictures of the US and UK armoured columns that pushed into Iraq and Kuwait during the 1991 First Gulf War, the vehicles looked like gypsy caravans, because they had all the personal kit strapped to the outside of the vehicle. Inside the vehicles were the crews, the personal weapons, the ammo, water and maybe the rations, because that was what was most critical to fight the vehicle. The kit on the outside was not necessary to keep the vehicle fighting so it did not need to be inside.",
      "24": "Modern backpacks tend to use a lot of fancy foam padding which had not been invented during the world war 2 era. This meant that placing many of the jagged metallic objects soldiers in the small of ones back could be quite uncomfortable. Thus the weight tended to be placed higher on the shoulders.\nAnother consideration is that paratroopers needed smaller packs that would not tangle in their parachute.\nFurthermore modern backpacks help offset the weight imbalance of the heavy kevlar plate over the chest\nWW2 had abundant motor transport for allied troops (don‚Äôt carry weight you don‚Äôt need to).\nFinally in WW2 there tended to be greater knowledge of when and where combat would take place-allowing soldiers to stow their gear before heading into battle. Its worth mentioning that the only non-motorised light infantry unit that could safely use a flat backpack had one that looks a bit more modern in its dimensions\nUs Marines on Peleliu",
      "25": "Well, one reason they make good Images.\nThe apparent reason, WWII missions, was different than some of the tasks today. You will only carry a large backpack if you need to move with a lot of equipment. So think training, overnight movements without noisy vehicles, and keeping your gear for a few days. In WWII, there were fewer cameras on the battlefield, so we didn't document as much as we do now. Also,The soldiers carried less equipment, because their vehicles could take most of the heavy stuff. Today's mission requires more flexibility, service members dual hat and need equipment for contingencies. Plus the larger the pack the more you will take. If you're pack is small you will only take the essentials.\nAlso, the photos just make people appreciate our service members.\nThere are several reasons to change the load out. Look at how much armor service members wear. A rifleman's loadout is 30lbs heavier than it was 70 years ago. They need plates, radios, batteries for everything, And heavier weapons.\nHowever, weight is not a new issue and the military will always work around its problems.",
      "26": "Packs weren't as paded, ergonomic, or generally as comfortable as today's ALICE packs. Further, the military has. Decided that soldiers and Marines should be able to operate for longer periods with little to no resupply.",
      "27": "Infantry soldiers have always used a backpack or satchel to carry items. WWII soldiers were no different. I think what you might have seen was an assault pack. Assault packs are used to carry mission essential items. I.E. ammo, maps, water, etc. Rucksacks are used to carry non- essential items such as parkas, extra uniforms, and an e-tool. Some assault packs attach to the larger rucksack. If a unit is tactically moving , if possible, they would drop their rucks, and take their assault packs to execute a mission.",
      "28": "Everybody in WW2 wore a framed rucksack other than the Russians. The Russians wore a blanket rolled and worn diagonally as a sash across their mid-section. They wore a bag attached by straps on their backs. They wanted to conserve steel.",
      "29": "With the exception of some special operations units, and even then, carrying the large ruck occurrs almost never. It's really a matter of convience and more efficient to pack the most critical combat equipment to sustain oneself in a large pack rather than a seabag/dufflebag of the same size. In WWII one's equipment went into a dufflebag or two which are harder to carry.\nFor combat operations like patrols that might last 24-72 hours, nothing has changed. The small packs of WWII are replaced with modern ‚Äúday packs\" that are more friendly on one's body, easier to carry and more comfortable. But soldiers will not carry a large pack on a combat patrol. With the body armour and kevlar helmet alone, soldiers are carrying significantly more weight already. In addition, soldiers carry more water now than in previous years to avoid dehydration which arguably caused more casualties than enemy bullets.",
      "30": "Some very good answers here and a case of something taking on a life of its own. Once a soldier CAN carry more, there are always folks who will assume that s/he SHOULD. The move to mechanisation, in particular, drove this and in my army the first item specifically designed to cater to the soldier in the APC was virtually impossible to carry (since it was never really intended to be carried). I am reminded of a story about a German General (don‚Äôt recall which one now, but late 19th/early 20th century) who is alleged to have said that ‚ÄúAn infantryman should always carry an axe in case he has to break down a door!‚Äù. In other words, be not only prepared but also equipped for all eventualities all the time. Can‚Äôt think of an infantryman who would agree with that Teutonic gentleman but,‚Ä¶ I digress‚Ä¶..\nI wanted to provide an example of a point made by other responders about what you have versus what you actually carry in action. Early in my career, our personal belongings and equipment were distributed as follows. We wore webbing (belt, shoulder straps, ammo pouches, etc) and, of course, had a couple of fairly capacious pockets. This was known as fighting order. To that we could add a small pack (one simple bag, no outside pockets, 20 litres or so(?)‚Ä¶) and that combination was then known as battle order (a ‚Äúfight‚Äù being smaller and closer than a ‚Äúbattle‚Äù). When we added a large pack (same as the small pack but maybe twice as large), the large pack went on the back and the small pack moved to the left hip. This was known as marching order. We never carried more ‚Äúluggage‚Äù than that. Back in B Echelon, however, every man had a kit back (think duffle bag without wheels) with the rest of his personal belongings in it‚Ä¶things like underwear and socks and a shirt, etc.).",
      "31": "Those poor guys were weighed down with 40‚Äì60 pounds of gear and you want them to carry a backpack too? lol\nBasically, soldiers carried their stuff in little leather bags of various size and design that hung off the multiple belts each solider wore.\nIt was a lot easier to mass manufacture little leather bags (except in Britain where they used some sort of woven material) than to make and equip each soldier with an expensive backpack.\nException: the US Army brought a standard ‚ÄúMark 10‚Äù backpack into service in‚Ä¶.you guess it, 1910. Capable of carrying 70 pounds of weight, it sucked.

      "32": "The US and other armies were stuck on the small haversack in which were carried a minimal amount of specified items. They were not adaptable to the larger loads needed for prolonged operations in weather and terrain extremes: additional rations, cold weather clothing, sleeping bags, and one- or two-man shelters. In fact, except for arctic conditions, sleeping bags were not used, just two blankets and an overcoat by most armies.\nRucksacks were used in Scandinavian countries and Germany. From 1943 Germany issued simple rucksacks to all troops. You never see them in movies though as they were carried by unit transport. The US also issued rucksacks to mountain and arctic units.\nWWII rucksacks were not anything like the modern rucks, which are extremely refined and based largely on civilian backpacker rucksacks. It was Vietnam that saw the wide use of rucksacks and the post-VN rucks evolved into the modern models used today.",

What limits the amount a soldier can carry is weight, and we have been very successful in making things much lighter than during WWII, so now a soldier can hump a larger volume of stuff for the same weight, so they need a larger pack. A WWII field load out was 80‚Äì100lbs, I think current load is 60.",
      "41": "They ditched some of their gear. They had tents, medical, hygienic and practically all the gear a soldier needs. Their Cargo Packs w/ tent were the items often discarded (left behind) and instead they just used their raincoats. During the ww2 soldiers usually traded their gear for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù gear. Some soldiers had preferences for lighter or cooler gear. A big factor was weight though and that still applies to soldiers today. The more gear the more fatigue.

Eventually these morphed into the Molle gear that was issued in the late 1990s .

      "48": "Soldiers have been carrying stuff in large backpacks or bags for a very, very long time. Soldiers also know that they don't want to die in combat due to being overloaded with assorted crap that won't help them stay alive. So most armies from well before the Greeks and Romans through the present day have developed ways to have soldiers carry needed gear for battle and needed gear for living and marching in somewhat independent manners. Soldiers generally carry what they need to carry for their mission whether it be a pack for a week or a day pack or combat gear only. The rest they tend to leave with the vehicle/camp/wagon train/cache.\nPatrols generally don't need a lot of stuff because you are starting and ending at camp. (FOB or whatever else you want to call it). Longer missions may require more gear and if combat develops you can be certain that the troops will find a place to stash the stuff while they fight with less of a load.",
      "49": "Soldiers don‚Äôt have ‚Äúbackpacks‚Äù, they have rucksacks. The reason rucksacks are different today compared to the past is that the missions are different today. More kinds of equipment are also used today that didn‚Äôt even exist 45 years ago, much less 75 years.",
      "50": "They didn have all the gear that we had. The average ruck weight of a WW II era soldier was like 20 or 30 lbs. In Vietnam it was like 40 or 50 lbs and in Iraq our ruck could easily weigh 90 to 100 lbs. They didn have night vision and batteries. We carried more ammunition.

      "1": "The Israeli Defense Forces have mobilized their reserves and these troops lack personal gear, for example, body armor and ballistic helmets.\nTherefore, if Israel‚Äôs operations in Gaza continue for a longer period of time and/or if the Lebanese Hezbollah militias enter the conflict, we may see a shortage of armor plates and other (less important) military items on the world market. Fortunately, Ukraine is now producing a lot of personal military gear by itself so that these shortages will only have a minor effect on the country‚Äôs ability to fight a war.\nMore serious is the drone situation. If the Israelis decide that their forces need to be equipped with small drones (mini drones for reconnaissance missions and FPVs to attack military targets), it may cause a big headache for Ukraine‚Äôs military and for the country‚Äôs drone producers. There will not only be a shortage of drones on the market, but also a lack of spare parts, and electronic components.\nA picture of a German ‚ÄúGepard‚Äù anti-air cannon tank that was delivered to Ukraine.\nIt's not that the Israelis really need all these items; after all, the Hamas organization is not the Russian military and as an insurgency force, has only very limited combat capabilities. However, there's a general perception that you need all these fancy things before you come even close to a war zone and nobody can stop an Israeli citizen to spend their money on these things online.\nIn other areas, for example, financial donations and weapons deliveries, I don‚Äôt expect things to change. In size, intensity, and impact on the world‚Äôs security situation, you cannot really compare Ukraine with Gaza.\nRussia‚Äôs war on Ukraine is the biggest land war since World War II. The frontline is 600 miles long (around 1,000 kilometers) and the number of troops and material involved is mindblowing. The number of victims and the level of destruction is unparalleled.\nOn the other hand, the border between Gaza and Israel is only 42 kilometers long. Hamas is a terrorist organization and not an army. It has no tanks, no artillery, and no aircraft while Israel has the strongest army in the region.\nIn addition, Israel‚Äôs fight with Hamas is a counterinsurgency and as such, has its root causes in failed politics (on both sides). Although Israel deserves all our sympathies after last week‚Äôs terrible terrorist attack, we should not forget that one cannot win a counterinsurgency with brute force.\nSupporting Israel with military supplies (which they don‚Äôt need) won't solve the problem. And, of course, redirecting aid that was destined for Ukraine to Israel (as some US politicians have proposed) will only help the Russians.\nIf you want to help me support Ukrainian volunteers (civilian and military, foreigners and locals), please use the contact email in my profile description.",

      "4": "The issue of whether we possess genuine images of atoms or electrons is not a trivial one; it delves into the inherent limitations and capabilities of imaging technologies, while simultaneously probing the philosophical bedrock of what constitutes \"seeing.\" From the get-go, let's clarify a key distinction: electrons and atoms are governed by quantum mechanics, a realm where the classical, intuitive idea of an \"image\" is far from straightforward.\nWhen it comes to atomic imaging, techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) come to mind. STM, for instance, has provided stunning visualizations that showcase individual atoms as distinct points on a metallic lattice. However, these techniques offer more of a contour map of electron density rather than a snapshot of \"solid balls\" that one might na√Øvely associate with atoms. The visualizations often depict how electrons‚Äîthe very entities that define an atom's boundary‚Äîbehave at various energy states.\nElectron imaging, on the other hand, faces challenges that are fundamentally different and, in many respects, more perplexing than atomic imaging. Dirac's equation provides a relativistic description of an electron but does not lend itself to a clear, visualizable physical model. Imaging an electron isn't about capturing a minute particle in a moment but involves a complex interpretation of wavefunctions, mathematical constructs that encapsulate information about an electron's position, momentum, and spin.\nExperiments like the famous double-slit experiment further complicate our quest for capturing a definitive \"image\" of an electron. In such quantum mechanical setups, the act of measuring inevitably disturbs the state of the system, leading to the notion of quantum indeterminacy. So, even if we were to \"photograph\" an electron, the very act of doing so would alter the state we were trying to capture.\nAttempts to photograph electrons involve Feynman diagrams and quantum electrodynamics, the mathematical frameworks for describing interactions between light and matter. In particular, the collision between electrons and photons‚Äîparticles of light‚Äîyields patterns that can be interpreted as an image, albeit a non-traditional one. These collision outcomes give rise to scattering amplitudes, complex-number probabilities that inform the likelihood of an event occurring. While some might argue that these probabilities can be construed as an \"image,\" it is a far cry from a snapshot captured by a smartphone.\nDiving further into the quandaries of electron imaging, the advent of quantum computing is poised to redefine what we consider to be observable and, by extension, \"imageable.\" Quantum states can be manipulated to reveal properties otherwise indiscernible through classical means. However, these manipulations are complex algorithms that are about as far removed from \"photography\" as one can get.\nIn the world of imaging technologies, the development of quantum sensors is nudging the boundaries of what can be seen or measured. These devices, sometimes employing phenomena like quantum entanglement, could revolutionize our ability to \"see\" particles like electrons. Yet, this \"seeing\" will be mediated by an array of quantum states and transformations, significantly deviating from traditional imaging paradigms.",
      "5": "No, we do not have actual images of atoms or electrons in the traditional sense of capturing visual representations through conventional photography. Atoms and electrons are extremely small, and their sizes are on a scale much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. This makes it impossible to directly observe them using optical microscopes or cameras.\nHowever, scientists have developed indirect methods to study and visualize atoms and electrons. Some of these methods include:\nScanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM): STM allows scientists to observe the surfaces of materials at the atomic level. It utilizes a fine probe that scans across the surface, detecting changes in electrical current as it moves over individual atoms. STM produces three-dimensional representations of the surface topography, revealing the positions of atoms.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM): AFM is another technique that provides high-resolution imaging of atomic surfaces. It uses a tiny probe to detect forces between the probe and the surface. By scanning the probe across the sample, scientists can create detailed images of atomic arrangements.\nElectron Microscopy: Electron microscopes use a beam of electrons rather than light to image objects. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) can provide high-resolution images of materials, including the arrangement of atoms within a structure.\nWhile these techniques allow scientists to indirectly visualize atoms and electron behavior, the resulting images are representations or maps rather than direct photographs. They are based on the data collected through these specialized instruments and translated into visual representations using various algorithms and techniques.\nIt is important to note that our understanding of atomic and electron structures is primarily derived from theoretical models, experimental observations, and indirect measurements. These models and experimental data help us build a comprehensive understanding of atomic and subatomic behavior, even if we cannot obtain conventional photographs of them.",

Several weeks before Midway, the US turned back the Japanese fleet that was going to invade Port Moresby at the Battle of the Coral Sea. Then, the US bushwhacked the Japanese at the Battle of Midway. Several months later in August, the US invaded Guadalcanal and Tulagi. During practically this whole time, US (as well as British and Dutch) submarines were sinking Japanese ships. There was also a hell of a lot of land fighting going on in the Philippines during this time, and on the south Pacific islands Japan also invaded.

Immediately upon the official declaration of war the USN submarine fleet was ordered to initiate operations against Japanese shipping. Within a very short period of time there were carrier task force raids against several Japanese-held islands. US naval forces were engaged in the unsuccessful attempts to repel the Japanese forces from the Dutch East Indies and of course the US forces were active against Japanese forces invading the Philippines. The Japanese push toward Port Moresby by amphibious invasion was thwarted by the USN at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, just about 6 months after the Pearl Harbor raid, and of couse the Battle of Midway followed soon after.

      "17": "I don't know what version of the calendar you have but in April 1942 just 5 months after the attack they initiated the Doolittle raid where they sent a squadron of B-25 Mitchell bombers off the carrier Hornet make a bombing strike on Tokyo. After the strike the planes went on to land in China.\nIn May 1942, the Yorktown and Lexington tangled with 2 or 3 Japanese carriers at what is called.the battle of The Coral Sea. The results were about a stalemate except that the American task force denied an objective to.the Jaoanese Navy, first.time ever.\nThen in June came the big one, the Battle of Midway. In the course of.that battle.the Americans sank 4 of the 6 carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor just 6 months earlier.\nFinally in August 1942, the Americans undertook the invasion of Guadalcanal. Thus was the first land offensive by American forces anywhere in WWII. This began a series of battles over Guadalcanal that continued into 1943.\nI don't know, but it sounds to me.like the American forces were very busy fighting Japamese well before a year had passed.after.Pearl Harbor.",
      "18": "It only seems that way on paper. Remember Pearl Harbor happened in the last month of 1941, so things getting started in 1942. Today now, FDR would have been faced into the long, drawn-out process of forming a coalition before even beginning to plan.",
      "19": "Well at that time, they just couldn‚Äôt load up a couple aircraft carriers and head over there. I‚Äôm at that time Japan had a very formidable military. Plane, submarines. Ships, destroyers. It took planning of where to attack and where. It took a build up of boomers on friendly soil. So it took a year for everything to be in place. Including cleaning up Pear Harbor.",
      "20": "We didn‚Äôt take that long. The first attacks at Hawaii and the Philippines took place in December of 1941. It took December, January, February, March and a few days in April to retaliate across the 8,000km of the Pacific.\nWe retaliated as early as April of 1942, with the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. It caused a major shift of Imperial air defense resources to move back to the home islands, and away from the major theaters of combat to the South.\nThat was an effective pinprick raid, however, it was not until the summer of 1943 that major US Naval resources began flowing out of US shipyards to the Pacific and European theaters, even though the building program had started in early 1939. Then bases were taken in the Caroline Islands. That meant it was another full year before the Marianna islands were taken from Japan, and regular raids could begin.\nThe basic element in all this was the combination of shipyards, logistics and trained assault personnel. In 1939, the Army of Portugal was larger than the US Army. It takes years to train amphibious assault groups up to a useful standard. That the European Theater was given the higher priority didn‚Äôt make it any faster, but that would not have helped much until naval resources were also available to send to the Pacific.",
      "21": "I‚Äôm guessing this refers to the US offensive in the Gilberts and Marshalls islands.\nThe amphibious force was covered by (amongst other things) 6 fleet carriers, 5 light fleet carriers and 8 escort carriers. Only 2 of the large carriers existed a year before the rest was all wartime construction.\nThe significance of this offensive is that it cracked open the outer ring of Japanese defenses in the Central Pacific and with the Solomons/New Guinea campaign the two front advance was more than the Japanese could cope with.\nLike I said only 2 of the carriers existed at the time of Pearl Harbor, the other large carriers were probably under construction, the other smaller carriers were I think designed and produced during the war. Amphibious landing ships, landing craft etc etc, additional destroyers and cruisers even the Marine divisions were all post Pearl Harbor and it takes time.\nConsider an aircraft carrier, you rivet or weld it together, slide it down a slip way and smash a bottle on it saying ‚ÄúI name this ship yadda yadda‚Äù but that don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs anything like finished. You got to ‚Äúfit it out‚Äù install engines? electrical stuff? watertight doors? bunks and mattresses, dining facilities. Once you done that you need to load up with fuel, bombs, torpedoes sort of thing and then you got to get a load of sailors and pilots and have them get used to handling the ship. Takes time!\nWhat I find interesting is that for the first year of the war the US was eminently willing to risk its limited assets to strike back at the Japanese any way it could.",

      "23": "Because we didn‚Äôt have bombers that could fly, non-stop, from California to Japan and back. Most of the Pacific was Japan‚Äôs back yard. So we had to clear it, island chain by island chain. When we finally took the Marianas (Tinian, to be precise), we could bomb Japan - and did.",
      "24": "The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo was just over 4 months after Pearl Harbor. The Battle of the Coral Sea was 5 months after PH, and Midway just 6.\nIn another two months the Marines landed on Guadalcanal. By November 15 the two Kongo-class battleships that had escorted the Kido Butai to Pearl Harbor had been sunk in the decisive naval battle that ended the Japanese threat to Henderson Field and Australia. Only two of the 6 carriers ...",
      "25": "Time to prepare.\nTHE most savvy campaign of Ww2 was the landing on Guadalcanal.\nJapan‚Äôs war machine stretched iit‚Äôs shipping resources beyond the break point sending in counter attacks by drubs and drabs ( 800 men and. A dozen light tanks to start) .\nThe other island garrisons withered and starved",

      "27": "It took only eight months for the USA to strike back against Japan at the Battle of Guadalcanal. Prior to this, the Americans employed hit and run tactics against them.

      "28": "One year? The major events in the Pacific in Dec 1942 were:\nThe Americans on Guadalcanal start the offensive to take the Mt Austen region.\nAustralians capture Gona on New Guinea (as part of the truly awful Buna-Gona-Sananda campaign).\nI‚Äôll even throw in the Battle of Tassafaronga for good measure (November 30), when three US cruisers were badly damaged and one sunk by an inferior Japanese force.\nThat‚Äôs pretty much it.

    "answers": {
      "1": "Apart from being head of state, King George VI was 44 years old and of less than robust health when WW2 began.\nBesides, he had served in the Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force, during WW1 and fought at the Battle of Jutland. He had ‚Äòdone his bit‚Äô and ‚Äòseen the elephant‚Äô so he had nothing to prove.\nAlso he was a member of the Buckingham Palace Home Guard.\nWith his own personal Sten Gun.",
      "2": "Because he was King. We tend not to send our head of state to war. Does the POTUS actually seve on the front? Christ bone spurs must be common place for US politicians.\nThe Duke of York (later King George VI) commanded a gun battery at the Battle of Jutland",
      "3": "That is akin to asking why President Roosevelt or Emperor Hirohito didn't actively fight. They are the leaders (or sovereign) of their respective countries. You would not expect Josef Stalin or Albert Lebrun to actively join the airforce, army or navy of their nation and take to the field of battle, you would be risking the very leadership of your country for no practical gain.\nThe convention of the King leading his army into battle ended around the time of the Napoleonic War. No longer was it one army marching against the other. Now you have multiple armies on multiple fronts, commanded by trained officers and led by those with decades of experience. Were your Sovereign to decide to take to the field he would be inexperienced and unlikely to be of any use, whilst his rank and status would demand he be in overall command. You can hardly expect the king to become a mere captain or sergeant, you would be hard pressed to justify why the nations ruler was even a colonel!\nWhilst all British male Sovereigns have served, usually in the navy, once they became king they were no longer ‚Äúin the business‚Äù of going to war. Instead their role was to lead their people, to boost morale, to set an example.\nGeorge VI and his family, against advice, decided to remain in the capital during the blitz. They had been told it was unsafe and they should move north, or even leave for Canada. George is reported to have replied that to do so would be to set an atrocious example and to give the impression that the war could not be won. Instead, he and his family would remain and share the risks with everyone else. That example instilled much needed strength and pride in the population, knowing their king was also being bombed (Buckingham Palace was bombed two or 3 times) helped them to feel as though they were all in it together. That was a far more beneficial use of the King's time than floating around, getting in the way on a battleship, or even trying his hand at soldiering.",
      "4": "For the same reason that monarchs stopped appearing on the battlefield after the early 18th century (in the case of Britain, it was George II at Dettingen in 1743). If the monarch (and Head of State) got killed, it would chuck a big fat spanner in the works of the machinery of state. If he got captured, the enemy would almost certainly have access to the most secret information about Britain‚Äôs status and strategic plans. Either way, it would also be more than a bit demoralising.\nIn addition, the King was in his mid-forties and not in the best of health, so even if he‚Äôd volunteered he would have been turned down.\nIt is worth mentioning that George VI had seen active service in the Royal Navy during WW1 (as the second son of George V - ‚Äúthe spare and not the heir‚Äù).",
      "5": "He fought in the Battle of Jutland for the Royal Navy. In the Second World War he had a far more responsible job as KING to maintain people‚Äôs belief and courage during the German Blitzkrieg on London and other cities.",
      "6": "The times when Kings led their men into battle ended with the Napoleonic age.\nThroughout the First World War, King George VI (then Prince Albert) served with the Royal Navy.\nAs the second son of King George V, he was not heir apparent, and consequently allowed to see active combat during the Battle of Jutland.\nBy 1939, he was King.\nConcurring with the previous answers, His Majesty would have been far too inexperienced to captain his own ship, and positioning a sovereign in a subordinate position would only have been improper. Moreover, by the time the war broke out, he was too old to serve and too important for public morale to risk dying.\nKing George VI did, however, wish to be present at the Normandy landing and was fully prepared to do so with Winston Churchill. It was only with his private secretary, Tommy Lascelles, placing into perspective that he would have to advice Princess Elizabeth on her choice of Prime Minister if both men perished, that prevented him from going.\nTo his credit, His Majesty King George VI was an exemplary sovereign during the wartime and did a fantastic job with his wife in raising public morale for Britain (and all Allied countries, for that matter).",
      "7": "From The Royal Family [ http://Royal.uk ]\nKing George VI's (then Prince Albert) account of the Battle of Jutland\nOn 31 May and 1 June 1916, British and German naval forces met off the coast of Denmark, in what was to be the largest naval battle of the First World War, with heavy losses on both sides. Among those serving in the British Fleet was King George V's second son Prince Albert, the future King George VI (1895-1952).\nThe Prince had been enrolled in the Royal Naval College at Osborne House at the age of thirteen. In September 1913 he was commissioned as a Midshipman on board HMS Collingwood, and he was serving on this ship during the fighting at Jutland, as he describes here. Prince Albert is the only British Sovereign to have seen action in battle since William IV.\n‚Ä¶ We went to ‚ÄúAction Stations‚Äù at 4.30 p.m. and saw the Battle Cruisers in action ahead of us on the starboard bow. Some of the other cruisers were firing on the port bow. As we came up the ‚ÄúLion‚Äù leading our Battle Cruisers, appeared to be on fire the port side of the forecastle, but it was not serious.\n‚Ä¶As far as one could see only 2 German Battle Squadrons and all their Battle Cruisers were out. The ‚ÄúColossus‚Äù leading the 6th division with the ‚ÄúCollingwood‚Äù her next astern were nearest the enemy. The whole Fleet deployed at 5.0 and opened out. We opened fire at 5.37 p.m. on some German light cruisers. The ‚ÄúCollingwood‚Äù‚Äôs second salvo hit one of them which set her on fire, and sank after two more salvoes were fired into her ‚Ä¶\nI was in A turret and watched most of the action through one of the trainers telescopes, as we were firing by Director, when the turret is trained in the working chamber and not in the gun house. At the commencement I was sitting on the top of A turret and had a very good view of the proceedings. I was up there during a lull, when a German ship started firing at us, and one salvo ‚Äústraddled‚Äù us. We at once returned the fire. I was distinctly startled and jumped down the hole in the top of the turret like a shot rabbit!!

      "8": "Richard Airey offered a succinct answer and there is no need to repeat any of it.\nThe monarchs of England were no longer in the business of leading national armies to war from the Age of the Renaissance.\nDuring World War 2, the British armaments industry gave King George V his very own, personal STEN submachinegun for self-defense.\nThe king‚Äôs STEN was naturally a fine, carefully selected and reworked model to ensure it was in tip top operating condition, assembled with great care and superior workmanship as much as was possible with the rough but effective STEN. The king‚Äôs STEN bore a nice, near black finish not found on any other production STEN. It came in a fine, polished wood presentation box with velour fitted lining. The presentation box included a cleaning kit and six spare magazines.\nClearly this fine example of a STEN, while intended for the king‚Äôs personal defense, was never going to be put into actual combat use. After the war the STEN went into a royal museum.\nFew people know that the monarch of Great Britain is considered the legal owner of all of Britain‚Äôs military weaponry and equipment. King George V could legally have placed his presentation STEN on Sotheby‚Äôs auction where it no doubt would have fetched a very high price, higher if the king autographed his STEN. The king could pocket the profit.\nNote: Osprey Publishing offers a fine, in-depth book on the British STEN submachinegun. STEN manufacturing numbered over 4 million. It became synonymous as the British People‚Äôs personal weapon comparable to the American M1 carbine which achieved just over 6 million production.",

McDonald's annual gross profit for 2022 was $13.207Billion (Billion dollars!), a 4.98% increase from 2021, and it is increasing even faster in 2023, so plenty of rich people are getting even richer.

      "1": "The mechanical reaper and the improved plow helped to feed the nation in the 19th century. The earliest wheat farmers, for example, were able to gather (not thresh) only one acre of their crop in a day with a knife or sickle. This was improved by the use of the cradle scythe to three acres per day. Yet the introduction of the horse powered mechanical reaper increased the output to an amazing twelve acres per day. In 1830, one farmer fed himself and his family. By 1930, one able farmer could feed ten non-farming families. The percentage of American farmers has fallen from a third of the general population in the early 20th century to less than two percent today.\nIn addition, the deployment of irrigation and the development of strains with a higher seed to grain ratio have helped.",

Suicide is considered an honorable death to the Japanese. Especially in warfare. Surrender was not in the Japanese vocabulary and is considered a disgrace to the empire which is a good part of the reason the Japanese treated POWs so terribly. The Japanese boasted that Tarawa could not be taken by a million men in 100 years. The marines took it in 72 hours but at a terrible cost.\nAdmiral Shibasaki boasted to his troops, \"a million Americans couldn't take Tarawa in 100 years.\" His optimism was forgivable.

      "7": "Thousands of mass suicides by ordinary citizens in the last days of Nazi Germany\nSoviet Army officers observe the bodies of women who committed suicide in a Vienna park at the end of World War II\nMost people have heard how many top Nazis such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and Goering took their own lives at the end of the Third Reich, and how some failed military commanders such as Model, Rommel and Kluge (although suicides of Rommel and Kluge were forced options as both were implicated in the Hitler assassination plot) did the same. History buffs may also know that Tresckow and Beck, two leaders of the failed Hitler assassination plot ‚Äì Operation Valkyrie ‚Äì also committed suicide.\nWhile Hitler and many other government and military high-ups chose to commit suicide by pistol or poison in the face of Germany‚Äôs imminent defeat, there were also thousands of other unnoticed yet tragic suicides committed by ordinary people in the bloody twilight of Nazi Germany. For instance, in one notable case, a housewife first drowned her young children and then hanged herself; in another one, an entire family consuming poison in one final, fatal gathering.\nTwo German women found dead in a park after taking their own lives\nAccording to some estimates, there had been tens of thousands of civilians taking their own lives in a collective madness driven by hopelessness and fear of Soviet Army‚Äôs impending revenge.\nThe blood-curdling fear of enemy revenge was so horrifying that, in the small town of Demmin (northeastern Germany), an incredibly wave of 700 suicides occurred ‚Äì about 10% of the town‚Äôs population ‚Äì as the Red Army closed in on the town.\nGermans fleeing Berlin en masse\nPeople of all ages, professions and classes killed themselves, often taking their babies and children along to their graves.\nThe young wife of a Wehrmacht lieutenant strangled her three-year-old son with a rope and then hanged herself.\nA 71-year-old health insurance administrator, his wife and daughter all hanged themselves after killing their young grandchildren.\nIn the G√ºnther family home, 12 people died ‚Äì some poisoned themselves, some slit their wrists, and some were shot with a hunting rifle.\nCirculating rumors and news of innumerous gang rapes and killings by the Soviet soldiers was causing mass panic and hysteria among the German people. It is estimated that about two million German women had been sexually assaulted at the end of the war.\nReportedly, many of the rape victims staggered down to the Tollense River and drowned themselves. Some led their children by the hand into the river after loading stones into their pockets, purses and backpacks √† la Virginia Wolfe.\nLeipzig municipal official Ernst Kurt Lisso with his wife Renate and daughter Regina after all three committed suicide by cyanide in April 1945\nIn one town‚Äôs burial records, burial lot 135 mentions a girl, barely a year old, who died on May 1, 1945, ‚Äústrangled by her grandfather.‚Äù\nAlthough we will never know the exact figures because in the chaotic final days of the war, official statistics, documentation and medical reports almost ceased to exist, most historians believe that German suicides have been in the tens of thousands from all over Germany.\nA Nazi general on trial for war crimes estimates the size of the cyanide capsules used by senior leaders to commit suicide\nIronically, more civilians and ordinary people committed suicide than members of the military. One of the most startling findings was that the epidemic of mass suicide was by no means limited to hardcore Nazis, who really had a lot to fear. In fact, it was regular men, women and children alike, young and old, workers and businessmen, nurses and doctors, from all walks of the German society.\nSome scholars chalk suicidal epidemic up to the mass psychology and influence of Nazi ideology with which most of the German society was brainwashed, and as a result, wilingly or not, cast their lot with the Nazi regime and gave their tacit approval to become collateral damage in Nazi war effort.\nDuring the first few years before the war, everything was hope and glory, devotion and love for the F√ºhrer. At the outset of the war, there was an overwhelming feeling of pride, power, superiority and hatred. Then, in the last years of the war, those feelings were replaced by pain, fear, despair and even self-loathing. This all culminated in the devastating experience of the annihilation facing the hallowed fatherland.\nThe wife of Leipzig Deputy Mayor Ernst Kurt Lisso, Renate Stephanie, and their daughter Regina after they committed suicide on April 18, 1945\nAnother sobering fact is that there had been many more suicides in the Soviet-occupied areas of Germany than in the Allied-occupied areas. When the Red Army finally crossed into Germany from the east, Soviet soldiers did in fact commit many atrocities against civilians, and there is no doubt that there were more suicides in Soviet-occupied Germany than elsewhere.\nDespite lack of exact figures, some historians estimate that the suicides in the Soviet-occupied Germany was at least 20 times that of the Allied-occupied areas.\nOne cannot help but wonder how could so many people make such a tragic decision and then actually follow through with it. Committing suicide is the hardest decision and action to take as we are all hardwired to cling to life at all costs; so it is an excellent indicator of the extreme mental state of the Germans at the time.\nIn 1945, many factors in Germany converged to create this highly-agitated state of mind: fear of violence and Russian revenge, a feeling of guilt and complicity, hopelessness, and the loss of homes and loved ones. This toxic mindset, no doubt, produced a hard-to-resist, contagious, hysterical atmosphere, and when so many people are killing themselves, herd mentality tends to follow.\nAs one witnessing those days said: ‚ÄúDeath became our routine.‚Äù\nWalter Doenicke, a major in the Volkssturm national militia, lies on the floor of Leipzig city hall after committing suicide\nThe real tragic part was that ordinary people, perhaps heard of the Nazi‚Äôs unspeakable atrocities especially on the Eastern front, expected the worst, and instead of facing the music, used any available means to kill themselves: hanging, shooting, stabbing, slashing wrists, poisoning and drowning - many even killed their children first.\nBy one count, 53 army generals, 14 air force generals, and 11 admirals killed themselves. That makes about one thousand ordinary Germans taking their lives for each Nazi honcho.\nHowever, Hitler‚Äôs demise had little to do with the mass suicides because many Germans no longer cared about their deranged F√ºhrer. Shamelessly, radio broadcasts reported that he died heroically in battle, not by his own hand. So Hitler‚Äôs death was, like his whole life, a big lie.\nIn a similar fashion, during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, many Japanese civilians, including entire families, committed suicide as Japanese defenses crumbled.\nNazi Germany still stands out as a cautionary tale regarding the dire consequences and unbearable human costs of becoming willing and blind followers of a cult of personality that is built on and led by a psychopathic killer.\nHistory repeatedly tells us that these evil endeavors never end well.",

Logically there is no way the West can sustain the conflict.\nBy destroying Nord Stream Pipeline and placing Sanctions on Russia they have created multiple problems for themselves.\nAn absence of energy makes it extremely difficult to manufacture anything.\nAn absence of jobs makes it impossible to keep people employed.\nWhen you don‚Äôt have production or anyone who can afford to purchase products, you have a massive decline in the economy.\nThe west doesn‚Äôt have the financial capability nor the means to produce multiple armies to engage in a conflict.\nSecond point to this is that the morale for society is low after 20+ years of ongoing conflicts.\nThere is no conviction to engage in a conflict to support Ukraine any longer.\nIf the West/US can no longer afford to support Ukraine, and Ukraine loses, then Politicians will blame Ukrainians.\nThat is quite literally what is causing inner conflict within western Europe and the US.\nThis implies Ukraine is losing.\nThe US/West will try to win the propaganda war, even if they lose the proxy war.\nThe Russians are a very formidable nation that isn‚Äôt worth disturbing.\nYou (the west/usa) can‚Äôt fight a two front war, one with your own people, and two an external force.\nCivil unrest will prevent and mitigate the conflict, especially with conscious objectors, which is a good thing."

      "1": "Like the DniproHES dam was when the Soviets blew it up in August 1941. This is a tactic Russia is familiar.\nReconstruction was completed in 1950. It took six years to rebuild the dam. It was done by lowering the water so access to the same could be obtained.",
      "2": "Just like how the Soviets destroyed the DniproHES dam in August 1941, Russia is known for using this tactic.\nThey managed to rebuild the dam by 1950, and it took them six years to do it. The process involved lowering the water level to access and repair it.",
      "3": "Same way it was bult.\nDivert the water, build or repair the dam and then redivert the water to the dam.\nAs for who will do this, Russia will be making the reparations from the money they have scattered all over the world that has been frozen along with any reparations they will be forced to make.\nThe hundreds of billions of dollars along with an entire country to be rebuilt all at once will necessitate tax incentives that will provide an investment opportunity the likes of which the world has never seen.\nThe rush for contractors and construction companies that make Haliburton look tiny will be a virtual modern day Eldorado that will go into the history books as a 21st century Rush with the fastest and most effective results making the grade no matter the cost.\nUkraine will quickly bec...",
      "4": "It will be built anew, better.",
      "5": "Basically the dam must be rebuilt from scratch because the incompetent military caused more damage than was desirable to achieve the objective of denying the lower Dnipro as an assault route to the Ukrainians. It will be necessary to create a coffer dam to divert the water flow around the dam so the damage can be removed and a new dam built.",
      "6": "We will see. Perhaps it can be repaired. But a serious investigation could lead to the comclusion that the whole dam has to be taken away and built anew."
