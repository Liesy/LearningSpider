    "answers": {
      "1": "I wouldn’t unless I had to.\nMy M16A2 from the Gulf War worked best when I had a magazine to load it with. Tossing away mags is a great way to make sure that you’ll run out of ammo in the next action. I personally didn’t go through a full mag in that war, but I’m I wouldn’t have tossed it away if I had the choice. I would have slid it back into my ammo carrier or a pocket and moved on.\nOne thing you miss in movies and other media is that you actually have to LOAD your own mags and they only give you so many mags! Yeah, you can have lots of loose rounds but you might only have a handful of mags! You need those things!!!",
      "2": "No, we don’t throw them away. But, we do something real crazy with them, which you wouldn’t expect. I will tell you the secret handed down from one generation of soldier to the next, as long as you promise not to tell anybody, okay?\n*I look left, look right, very slowly look back at you, and whisper real quiet…*\nWe reuse them.",
      "3": "This is how a full ammo box of 800 5.56 NATO rounds arrive. It has no magazines at all. You need to load them yourself.\nThey have a stripper clip that attaches to the magazine, and let's you quickly put in 10 rounds off a strip.\nThey don't send that many magazines out to forward bases. All soldiers are required to police and inspect their magazines, then reload them.",
      "4": "I’ve seen that once. Our unit was attacking an enemy checkpoint at night and while I was shooting my rifle, I could see another soldier to my right firing his marksmen rifle, a SIG-Sauer SSG-3000, cal. 7.62 X 51 mm.\nI was fascinated by the sight of his black silhouette against the night sky and for a while, I even forgot why we were there. He shot a few shots, the enemy shot back at him and then I saw that he changed mags and let the empty magazine drop to the ground.\nTwo guys from my unit in Kosovo. The first one with the SSG (photo: Visar Kryeziu, AP).\nSomeone shouted an order to retreat but before I joined my squad, I went to the place where the guy had lost his mag and picked it up.\nWe went to a nearby Albanian village where we had a debriefing in a farm house. I saw the shooter sitting on a couch and sat down next to him. While some commander was talking, I softly pushed my elbow in my neighbor’s side. When I had his attention, I gave him his lost magazine.\nHe didn’t thank me, although the SSGs came with only two mags and he had thrown away half of his supply of magazines. Instead, he looked at me like the idiot he was.\nThis was the only time in my life that I saw a soldier throwing away his empty mag. You never do that, even if there’s a truck with 100,000 mags right behind you. It’s unprofessional.",
      "5": "It depends on the situation and individual. Ideally you want to retain all your magazines. In the 2003 Iraq invasion, troops were advancing so fast that supply had difficulties keeping up. That meant you had a finite amount of magazines and other equipment.\nTechniques to retain magazines vary by units and their S.O.P.s. I trained to do tactical reloads. During breaks in firing or before clearing another room, I would reload a fresh magazine regardless of how many rounds were left in the previous one. Then I would stow that magazine into a pouch or whatever was convenient to put it in.\nMy last major fight was a different story. We were patrolling in an undisclosed area and walked into an enemy close, L shaped ambush. In a close ambush, it’s doctrine to fight through it. Fire superiority became my primary focus. I went through 15 magazines in less than 10 minutes going black on ammo. Maintaining fire superiority didn’t allow me to do anything but immediately dump the empty magazines for rapid reloading.\nWe defeated the ambush with minimal casualties yet, the area was too hot. We had to immediately disperse from the area which didn’t allow anyone to police up anything or even look for enemy bodies, weapons, equipment or do a BDA.\nPeople do throw away their magazines. I’ve done it and seen it done multiple times. Again, it’s ideal to maintain all your magazines but there are cases when it’s not practical or even possible to do so.",
      "6": "When soldiers receive a full ammo box containing 800 rounds of 5.56 NATO ammunition, it doesn't come with magazines already loaded. Instead, they need to load the ammunition into magazines themselves.\nThese magazines often have a \"stripper clip\" that attaches to the magazine and allows you to quickly load 10 rounds at a time from a strip of bullets.\nUsually, not many magazines are sent to forward bases, so soldiers have to take care of their magazines, inspect them, and load them up with bullets when needed.",
      "7": "They are reusable, ya know?\nI mean, in real combat, you can certainly lose mags. It happens. But, normally, you’d be packing most of them away - or, sort of collecting/policing them near your person, to be reloaded. If shit is really hitting the fan and you have to reload the mags during a firefight, you don’t want to be running all about looking for scattered mags in an active field of fire.",
      "8": "They do, but only in certain, special circumstances, and far less often than you might think. There are two types of reloads generally speaking, an emergency and a tactical reload. For the tactical reload the soldier retains both mags, simply exchanging the mag in the gun for the mag on his vest or belt, and vice versa. During an emergency reload there is no time for retaining the old mag, and so the soldier simply drops the old mag and inserts the new one which is much faster than the former. This is done for example in an intense combat situation under active fire or when a threat is directly in front of you.\nGenerally soldiers will always retain their magazines when the situation allows it as they are limited.",
      "9": "That's a negative my friend. Our unit would keep full magazines in the LBV upside down. Spent mags were kept right side up. It was our SOP. That way we knew roughly how much ammo we had left, so we could be more efficient doing round counts, and the full mags were less likely to get debris in them.",
      "10": "When rapidly using up ammo and your bolt locks open on an empty, you hit the release, the magazine drops as your other hand is grabbing a new one and slapping it home.\nThey don’t throw the magazine unless it didn’t eject properly and that slowed them down putting a fresh one in.\nIf practical, recover the empties because your box of rounds is not loaded in magazines. You can carry almost twice as many rounds in boxed “stripper clips” as in pre-loaded magazines. You want to be sure you have some pre-loaded magazines available, because when SHTF, you might go through a few under a minute. But you don’t want to be carrying all of your ammo already loaded in magazines because then you can’t carry as many rounds.",
      "11": "No. We even have a specific piece of gear to help us retain the mags.\nIt’s called a dump pouch. It’s there for us to stash empty magazines, though it’s also often used to store snackies.\nDisposable magazines have been something of a holy grail for decades. The problem is that it turns out that it doesn’t really make much economic sense, and constant supply issues has forced modern militaries to wave the white flag and give up on the dream of truly disposable magazines.\nThe only exception is during room clearing, where it’s expected for you to just drop the mag if you need to. You can pick it up after the gun fight, speed in the moment is more important.\nThis video does a good job of explaining it.",
      "12": "No, magazines are considered equipment, same as the rifles with which they are used. Soldiers would generally put the empty magazine into a pocket (or pouch, depending on what sort of load-bearing equipment they are wearing) before reaching for the next magazine and reloading the rifle.\nThe vast majority of infantry engagements take place at hundreds of yards and involve dozens of infantrymen, so there is generally no great rush to reload that would require recklessly discarding the empty magazines. It wouldn’t make much of a difference anyway since professional soldiers will spend more time aiming their rifles rather than shooting or reloading (the latter of which is done behind cover anyway).",
      "13": "No. Magazines are reusable and therefore are meant to be kept. Throwing them away means you have to come back for them or find a new one, which isn’t very easy.\nOne option is to use a dump pouch, which is basically a quick place to store used things without much thought.",
      "14": "No, soldiers in wars don't throw away empty mags as in video games. Soldiers usually have 7 mags with them one in their gun and rest of the mags in their vest. When a mag is completely empty or partially empty they take out the mag and throw it in the dump pouch.\nTHEY DON'T THROW IT AWAY. As magazines are not easily available especially during wars.\nOther than that I can say that the only situation where a soldier would throw an empty mag would be when they are in a stressful Combat situation. Even then it's not recommend to do so but you know the instinct of surviving sometimes prevents them. So after the combat is over and the situation has been dealt with they will have to pick those magazines back up. Magazines are not to be wasted because they are resueable.\nAnd you definitely won't want your enemy to get their hands on them. So in conclusion, no soldiers don't throw away empty magazines.",
      "15": "Typically now. And honestly, there’s no good reason to, that is unless you’re literally surrounded and fighting for your life. But it also kinda depends on your weapon\nThe C96 Mauser pistol of Germany has a removable magazine but also takes clips. Essentially a strip of metal that the ammo comes attached to.\n(a C96 being loaded)\nNow I know your question asked about magazines and not clips, but\nThese here are called Moon Clips. Essentially clips for revolvers. Now these are probably a lot more disposable than magazines.\nMoon clip - Wikipedia\nLast but not least we have an actual magazine to talk about\nThe legendary Famas. A gun made famous for looking almost exactly like the BR55 Battle Rifle in Halo\nBoth bullpup with a 3 round burst and having that arc on top (not really sure what that’s called)\nAnyway, that’s far beyond the point here.\nIn the early days of the FAMAS, it was meant to have a “disposable magazine”; something like a cross between a magazine and a clip where it’s made cheaply enough that you could just toss it off to the side without a problem.\nAlthough for some reason the soldiers using the gun didn’t realize this and reported that the magazines were too fragile. So the next batch of FAMAS rifles had a normal magazine",
      "16": "No, we don’t throw them away. But, we do something real crazy with them, which you wouldn’t expect. I will tell you the secret handed down from one generation of soldier to the next, as long as you promise not to tell anybody, okay?\n*I look left, look right, very slowly look back at you, and whisper real quiet…*\nWe reuse them.",

      "18": "No. Not generally. You might drop one in haste & for some reason not pick it up. But even then someone is likely to pick it up.\nNot only are magazines reusable, they're also necessary to operate the cycle of fire on most rifles. As many people have already mentioned, you generally get rounds sent to you. Not fully loaded magazines.\nAnother aspect is OpSec. Operational Security. You want to take out what you bring in. Coms. Gear. Food. Trash. Even mags. It's what my cargo pockets were for.",
      "19": "We train in two ways, one which retains the magazine and another meant for speed.\nThe first is to train extensively on magazine retention, where the Marine or soldier will remove the spent magazine, store it in a special pouch (called the dump pouch) and replace it with another magazine that you’re carrying. This is the ideal scenario, where you can save the magazines for later use. Apparently, there is a myth that the actual ammunition is delivered to troops in the magazine — like you would find in video games. That’s just not accurate. That said, it is much easier on the Platoon Sergeant (the person in your unit responsible for replacing things like ammunition and gear) to replace only the ammunition and not the ammunition and magazines. You don’t want to be stuck for a month with only one magazine and a pocket full of 5.56 rounds because you didn’t know the basics of magazine retention.\nThat said, we aren’t always in ideal situations, so Marines and the army also train extensively on faster options where retention isn’t the key, but enemy elimination takes priority. Below is an example of a speed reload with the M4. This is a common drill Marines use to minimize the time spent with an empty weapon.\nYou’ll notice that his time to execute a very precise series of movements is actually less than it would take some people just to push “X”.",
      "20": "No. Might as well ask if a six shot reveals over will shoot 30 times without reloading like in the movies.",
      "21": "We trained to DROP them. In most cases, we policed the area after the battle, collected them, and reused them.\nMost magazines fall out of your weapon when the mag release is pressed. If they don’t, you have to remove them. This takes time. So, you want them to drop out while you’re getting another mag and reloading. It doesn’t work on all rifles. The AK series is really bad for this. Or, maybe were. A lot of time has passed since I used them.\nIn training, most of us tried to save the magazines. One trick was to let them hit your boot instead of the ground. If you trained to save the magazine, and put it back in the pouch, it might get you killed.\nSo, I usually carried 180 rounds (5.56mm). That’s only six magazines. Then I had the one in my weapon, either a 20 or 30 round. IF I burned through it, I hit the release, let it fall to the ground, while retrieving another 30 from my belt. Duct Tape helped pull them up faster. Then the next two were easier to pull out. I then rammed it home. If it was the last round in the magazine, I had to charge it. If not, just return fire. We really tried not to run a magazine dry as it took a second longer to charge the weapon (hit the bolt release). While I’m at it, we never carried the weapon with an empty chamber. That took even longer.\nHowever, I can’t remember ever firing my weapon on full auto. I only had 180 rounds of ammo to back up that first mag. So, every shot had to count. If it was just a day patrol, I might carry more ammo.\nAs a rule, the magazines aren’t worth your life. Collect AFTER the engagement, not during. Train how you fight. If falling back, don’t worry about them.\nAnd, no, leaving them doesn’t mean you don’t have to reload them. Ammo came in ammo containers, on bandoleers that held stripper clips. It didn’t matter if you had new magazines or used ones, you got to reload the things, by hand. Today, I’m told they have machines that do this for you.\nWhat did I do if I ran out of ammo? Transitioned to my sidearm. This usually meant that things were going from bad to very bad.",
      "22": "Well.. here is a technicality in the early 1990s in the Canadian Army we used these crappy plastic “Disposable magazines “ for our C7s that were intended for one time use but as as it was the Canadian military they were used hundreds of times.. but we’re actually intended to be used once and thrown like in video games… but never happened in reality.\n* because these crappy plastic magazines weren’t disposed of right away most of us privately bought our own 30 round metal magazines that were sold on base stores called CANEX .. ironically a few years later all these 30 round magazines were kinda illegal due to Canadian gun laws that were enacted which limited rounds to citizens to 5. So yes military guys could still of course still have 30 but you couldn’t say have a 30 round clip privately. Amazingly the government came to their senses and now have metal magazines (after I left of courses)",
      "23": "Situationally. When the Luger was new a US Army evaluation negative was that there were only two mags per gun, they were to expensive to drop, and the gun useless if both were gone. Also that reloading to mag was time consuming in potential combat\nDuring WWII soldiers liked the M1 carbine, but the mags were bad. They would change mags every few weeks if not used in combat. Post war, as civilians have to buy their own mags, gun was handy but less respected.\nA mag is a resource. If the mag is good and consistent, bring it back when empty, time and activity allowed, would seem likely. A fellow soldier is also a resource. If one gets shot and a mag emptied suppressing fire to reach him, mag could be tossed and not recovered. All resources have value, but some more than others\nMetal cartridges were available for guns before the American Civil War. There was a preference for muzzle loaders in supply. The soldiers would use fewer rounds, not need the brass, and asking the soldiers to walk around and pick up their spent brass and ship it back unlikely.",
      "24": "When engaged in a firefight they are more concerned with inserting a fresh magazine than carefully putting the empties in the magazine pouch. Ideally a discarded magazine is stomped so it can’t be used against you. Supply/the unit armorer should have plenty of brand new magazines to replace anything discarded or broken. As my unit’s armorer I had 2,000 extra magazines at the start of the deployment to ensure everyone could stay in the fight. We transferred the extras at the end of the deployment during the RIP.",
      "25": "I wouldn’t think so. That’s a good way for the gunny to come over at some point and and say, “FFS, what the is wrong with you, Miller?”",
      "26": "Throwing empty magazines away is what I’m assuming you meant; the answer is no, at least not in the British army. Those magazines are issued kit (though every soldier has a few buckshee ones) and if you don’t hand the same amount back in, that you signed out, then you’re getting billed for them.\n….and no soldier wants to waste their beer tokens on repayment for lost kit.",
      "27": "No. You will almost certainly need them later and you are accountable for them. That is why soldiers often have “dump bags” on their belts. These are like the chalk bags climbers use, except bigger. In the heat of combat when you need to remove and replace a mag, you throw the empty one into the dump bag. At an opportune time, as a minimum you will remove it from the dump bag ( they clatter around in there) and secure it in a mag pouch. usually backwards to your normal orientation, so you don’t grab it thinking it’s full of ammo. When time allows, you reload it from a bandolier of ammo and put it back in a pouch ready for use.",
      "28": "I do not play video games, so I have not seen how the players in those games act. I can only tell you my experience from a peace time stand point. When my unit was sent to the rifle range each man was was given a certain amount of magazines. At the end of the day we cleaned our weapons AND the magazines we were given. When we turned in our weapons to the unit armory, we had to turn in the same amount of magazines we were issued. If we were short a magazine we had better be able to give a damn good explanation about why we were short a magazine. If our explanation fell short, we could expect to be disciplined. Magazines cost money, and the US Army, at times, actually cares about wasting money.",
      "29": "Up until the Vietnam war, the standard infantry rifle was the M-1 and it was loaded with an eight round clip. When the eighth round fired the clip ejected. The M-14 was magazine loaded, but the magazine often got loaded by ten round stripper clips with the magazine still in the rifle. So, no, the magazine was not thrown away.",
      "30": "I joined the British Army back in 2005 and I can tell you we were trained to keep the empty magazines. We would make sure our zip was down enough on our DPM jacket so we could pop the empties in it and because of the webbing and belt the mags would remain inside until we could reload them.",
      "31": "As eloquently put by Willem Defoe’s character in Platoon, “Police up your stuff. Don’t leave anything for the dinks.”\nWhatever you leave behind is something that could eventually be used against you in combat. One of the things we covered prior to deploying to Iraq was the fact that the insurgents were using the plastic trash from MREs in the creation of their IEDs.\nA typical meal packet would have about 5–6 plastic bags, plus a number of other plastic items, such as utensils. The plastic bags could be used as waterproofing material for IEDs, and the plastic utensils could be bent to act like a spring, separating contacts until pressure forced them together.\nAnd that’s just trash. If you’ve ever looted a body in a video game, the same thing is going to happen in real war, except there’s even more to take. So, if you have the opportunity, you don’t leave anything behind.\nNot to say it doesn’t happen. Bad habits easily develop from complacency, and sometimes in the heat of battle, you simple forget the small stuff when you have incoming rounds.",
      "32": "It depends on the situation. When you are in a firefight you just need to get that gun back up and lay down fire on the enemy. You’re focused on the fight right there and then. Generally, it’s good practice though to save your magazines in a dump pouch or elsewhere, seeing as you will need them for future missions, especially if they’re your own magazines or the nice new PMAGs.\nIf you mean doing the old flick of the wrist trick, sure I’ve seen it but it’s generally unnecessary, usually a mag will fall out on its own and it’s not a huge ordeal to swap it out with your hand. The old flick trick you see SOF guys doing shaves off those milliseconds that aren’t essential outside of a shooting competition. I would say practice dumping your mags in a pouch, it’ll save you trouble later on having to ask for more or explain how you lost yours.",
      "33": "Google Bill Speakman VC, I'm guessing mags would have gone the same way.\nOn 4 November 1951 in Korea, when the section holding the left shoulder of the company's position had been seriously depleted by casualties and was being overrun by the enemy, Speakman, on his own initiative, filled his pockets with grenades going forward and pelting the Chinese with the grenades. Having thrown all of the grenades he had taken, he returned for more. Inspired by his actions six men joined him in collecting and a pile of grenades and followed him in a series of charges. He broke up several enemy attacks, causing heavy casualties and in spite of being wounded in the leg and the shoulder continued to lead charge after charge. Such was the ferocity of the fighting that they ran low on ammunition, resorting to throwing stones, ration tins and beer bottles.",
      "34": "I used to stuff mine down the front of my jacket, you wouldn't be fiddling about trying to get them back in your mag pouch. Plus you want to know the first one you grab from the pouch is a full one.",
      "35": "In the Army a certain number of magazines are issued to you BY YOUR UNIT, but not by the Army (usually 7). Understand the difference between things the Army gives you, and things your specific units gives you.\nAs you enter a new unit as a new soldier, any discretionary “pooled” equipment like that will be divided by giving the junky stuff to the new-guy, and all the high ranking or popular soldiers will take the best magazines.\nAs you are in that unit for while, you will learn how to finally get your kit sorted out properly, and find and retain good, tight, new magazines.\nIf I was a dumbass new grunt with old, poorly performing magazines; I might toss them on the battlefield, and ask for NEW REPLACEMENTS.\nHowever, if I am a grunt who has good magazines, I will take my empty ones, and real quick during the firefight, I’ll save those nice, new magazines, and I will tuck them inside my undershirt, under my body armor.\nLater, when I get somewhere safe, I’ll reach under my shirt and retrieve my equipment.",
      "36": "You might drop the mag on the ground if you’re in a static, defensive position or into your turret if you’re mounted, but that’s about it. A proper reload drill has you remove the expended mag with one part of your grip and load the full mag with the other. Then you return the expended/partially used mag to your pouch. Some guys use a dump pouch while others put them back in their chest rig (sometimes with the rounds oriented the opposite direction from full mags so you can tell by feel). There are a fair amount of us who carried personally purchased af...",
      "37": "Hell no we keep those suckers. As a Canadian vet of Bosnia and Afghanistan we typically carried 6 magazines. 4 in our webbing one in a pocket and one in the rifle. When we would get resupplied they would only bring boxes of ammunition.\nalso in Canada we have to sign for our kit, so if we lost any we have to pay the govt back.",
      "38": "No you do not throw your empty magzine ever, in a war zone or in training or anything. Why?\nFor a magzine to function correctly it must have really low tolerance and it is one of the harder parts to manufacture, a lot of insurgent armies (most combat is against insurgents these days) have lack of support in the logistics area, why would you want to hand them a perfectly good magazine.\nMost soldiers carry loose bullets with them, once you empty your mag you can refill it.\nFighting in real life is not like that of video games, you are not firing all the time or moving towards the enemy, there is a lot of down time where you are sitting inside cover bullets flying over your head waiting for that air support you requested or that damm artillery strike, giving you plenty of time to do point 2.\nVideogames do not represent actual combat because if they did it would be actually boring, imagine walking 12 hours to a point Just to fire 4 bullets.. yeah sounds boring to me, still if you want to play something atleast a little bit realistic play ARMA it actually gets the squad work correct, for once you do not play as Rambo better yet read some answers by our fellow Quorans like Roland Bartetzko or Ron J Holland or Mark Stinson",
      "39": "This may be dated, but I used the k-pist m/45 (Swedish K) and we had the speed loader.\nIt meant that you could load up a new clip in just a few seconds. So you wouldn’t want to throw them away.",
      "40": "I was in the 82nd Airborne in the 90’s.\nWe were trained to never drop magazines, unless clearing rooms. You never knew when you would need your magazines, and at the time the 82nd trained to fight for 3 days unsupported, with little to no resupply.\nWe tucked our BDU top into our pants, and dropped empty mags down the front of our shirts.\nTo this day I haven’t found a better means of magazine retention.",
      "41": "No, not historically. Unless you’re stuck defending one place under siege, tactics dictate that you have to move to avoid being zeroed by artillery and air strike. Resupply doesn’t come with magazines that fit in your weapon like in video games, it comes in boxes of ammo (normally containing smaller boxes) that you have to load into your magazines. So when you empty a mag, you keep it to reload it later. You might drop it if you’re under fire when reloading your weapon, but you pick it up if you can before you move again. Stick in a pocket or back in an ammo pouch.\nAt least that’s the way we were taught when I was in. I was Security Forces in the US Air Force (yeah, yeah…suck my left one, you know I’m right) in the early 90s (then I got wise and retrained to be a mechanic). And of course situations will dictate your actions too. You don’t want to get shot retrieving a magazine you dropped. But you REALLY don’t want to be without a magazine to reload.",
      "42": "That's a tacticool fad on youtube. Semi auto guns require magazines, so there is no practical reason why any soldier would throw them away. In the midst of a serious gunfight, you might do a tactical reload, but if you have the option then you simply put it away.\nI used to rotate my mags left to right, front to back. Carried six mags on my vest, and one in the rifle, Nver shot more than 3.",
      "43": "Normally we pick them up. And if time allows we stuff the empty in a pocket. In a firefight you might drop them. As as matter of fact we are told to drop them and forget them replace with a new mag and continue firing. Throwing a mag can tweak them making them where they won’t feed properly. So usually I avoid throwing or stepping on them. You could find yourself in a situation where you are limited on the mags you have on hand. The last thing you want to do is put yourself in a situation where you are unable to load your weapon because you are out of mags.",
      "44": "Completely depends on the situation. Doing CT style room clearing. The last thing I’m going to worry about is if I retained my magazine when my gun goes dry it’s gonna end up in the ground.\nOut in the middle of the jungle, I’m going to keep and retain every magazine I can.",
      "45": "In general of course not, magazines are refilled and reused, however in the middle of combat in some cases where even a millisecond is of grave importance one might let if fall,not throw it you don’t want to damage it (unless an enemy is very close and charging, aim for his head :P just joking) If it is possible pick it up once things cool down a bit. Life > magazine",
      "46": "I did, but some units are dirt poor and will give you shit about it. It saves those few precious seconds where high volume return fire matter. Hate to say, but reality is that you will get ammo replenished from fallen comrades (Valhalla). Couldn't care less about an empty mag jetted during a fight. Besides, plenty of time to recuperate when checking enemy KIA for intel afterwards.",
      "47": "Rifle magazines are typically dropped from the rifle when you press the magazine release and falls free so that you don't have to waste time removing the magazine by hand.

    "title": "Which animal is more dangerous a lion or a tiger",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Both of these beasts are incredibly formidable and dangerous and are similar in many aspects. However if you compare their behavior or nature, a considerable difference can be observed. By dangerous, I suppose you mean danger projected towards humans.\nLions (wild) tend to be rather calm and collected, males don't usually bother much about anything and prefer to relax throughout most of the day unless there's opposition (other males) Hyenas or bull elephants nearby. They usually tolerate people. Take Dave Salmoni's experiment with wild lions as an example, where he closes in distance with a wild lion pride. Lons often fake charge people, as an intimidating gesture and usually ignore humans. There have been VERY FEW cases of maneating lions over the past few years.\nBut the Tiger is a whole different story.\nTigers are almost always the aggressors in human-tiger confrontations. Tigers have extreme prey drive, even more so than some other big cats and try to get their jaws around ANYTHING that moves and is within their capacity. Even when raised in captivity, this aggression and desire to seek and destroy things is instinctive. A little research about these majestic animals will tell you that Tigers, alongside homosapiens are among the few creatures that kill for sport. Take Soviet Russia's infamous stalking tiger incident for reference. Tigers are hyperaggressive carnivores, are highly opportunistic and are well established man eaters. They don't tolerate humans very well and are easily irritable. They hold the record for most number of humans ever killed by any animal. (Campavat tigress and several other notorious man eaters) Tigers are significantly more dangerous towards humans compared to lions. However, both can slaughter a mere homo sapien in a fraction of seconds.\nBut Tiger takes the cake here due to its superior agility, short tempered aggressive low tolerance attitude towards humans, somewhat of a preference of humans as prey and the ability to climb trees, and of course pure untamed ferocity.",
      "2": "For humans I believe tigers are a lot more dangerous. They sometimes even hunt humans by stalking and and jumping them. Their attack is always by surprise and you never see it coming.\nLions don’t hunt humans and they can usually be spotted at distance and avoided. Also they tend to tolerate human presence much better than tigers.\nThese are wild lions:\nWild tigers on the other hand will always either attack or flee upon humans approaching them.",
      "3": "Both lions and tigers are dangerous creatures honestly if provoked, and if they were bloodlust, then they are absolute monsters.\nPersonally though, I think a Tiger would honestly be more dangerous\nTigers are honestly more unpredictable then lions themselves (correct me if im wrong), I believe they eat, or try to put their jaws around anything that is like flesh.\nI also believe that Tigers are most of the time, more dangerous then even a Lion…… in fact…. I don’t really think that Lions even think about killing humans that much.\nThey’re actually pretty calm, and I believe they just prefer to relax…\nAnd while Tigers don’t really hunt humans that much (I believe), I feel like they still are wayyyyyy more dangerous then a Lion.",
      "4": "Both are capable of killing a human with ease, but tigers become man-eaters more often than lions. This may be because man-eaters tend to have something physically wrong with them that prevents them catching their natural prey - bad teeth are a common cause. If a lion cannot hunt, it can still feed on the kills made by the rest of the pride, so does not need to resort to killing humans. Tigers are solitary, so must hunt for themselves - if they are injured or ill, no-one is going to feed them. Another reason is that tigers are much more likely to come into contact with humans, especially Bengal tigers: considering how much indian population live close to tiger habitats, if tigers naturally hunted humans, it has been estimated that there would be thousands of attacks for year. Therefore, man-eating tigers are (thankfully) still very rare. Lions and tigers don’t naturally preys on humans, they attack only to defend themselves or their youngs. They become man-eaters only in exceptional conditions.",
      "5": "A male lion can weigh up to 250 kilograms.\nA male tiger can weigh up to 388 kilograms.\nA male lion has a bite force of 691 pounds per square inch.\nA male tiger has a bite force of 1050 pounds per square inch.\nA lion uses its paws to box other male lions and can cause severe lacerations to the opponent.\nA tiger's paw swipe is powerful enough to smash the skull of a bull, and kill it instantly.\nI'll let you decide which animal is the most dangerous.",
      "6": "Let’s see.\nStarting off, Tigers have a stat advantage.\nA Lion ( on average ) weighs up to 190 - 200 kg , whereas a Tiger can break the scale up to 310. Tigers are also longer , reaching 3 + meters as opposed to the Lion’s usual 2 ,2 .\nThey also have a massively stronger bite force, nearly double that of a Lion ( 1050 / 650 psi respectively ) and a much, much more disrespectful paw swipe ( 10.000 / 1040 pounds of force per hit respectively ) .\nTigers are also eqquiped with similarly sized fangs and larger claws than Lions , and to top it all off they also have one of the highest vertical leaps of any big cat ( Seriously, yikes\n) , albeit Lions are not that far behind.\nThey also tend to hunt more powerful prey , with Amur Tigers being known to prey on Brown and Asiatic Black Bears ( As well as Sloth Bears ) , ambushing and one-shotting them with a powerful bite to the neck/spine, and if they can do that to Bears , a human is like a tutorial level.\nMoving on to mentality, it’s here where it gets tricky. Lions live in a more competitive environment considering they often have to throw hands - well, paws - with other rival males or females, meaning they can be more agressive and less likely to back down from a fight.\nTigers on the other hand are solitary animals and highly territorial , and are believed to be more agressive than Lions ( Although this is highly circumstantial ) .\nLike, you understand it won’t matter much if either of the two presses you , but i can’t leave the answer at that.\nNormally neither Tigers nor Lions prey on humans regularly, although there have been instances of both of them adding humans to their grocery list.\nIn 1898 , a pair of maneless male lions - aptly named the Tsavo Man-Eaters - erased an estimated 135 people in the region of Tsavo in Kenya , most of who were construction workers.\nThey were stalking out different campsites throughout the expendition’s range , and at night they would enter said camps and drag out unsuspecting workers and make them a memory.\nThe crews tried to prevent the attacks by putting up campfires or bomas , but all of that to no avail since Lions are notoriously good leapers and could easily bypass the obstacles.\nAs the attacks mounted and officials started to get involved, they began setting up traps for the Lions hoping they’d get them this way.\nAnd after many unsuccessful attempts, they finally did.\nAlthough the reason these Lions resorted to hunting people is unknown , the most possible clauses are that :\nA ) It was the outcome of a rinderpest plague that ravaged the Lion’s food supply, thus forcing it to prey on humans.\nB ) It’s also possible that these Lions had already been accustomed to eating dead humans they found at the Tsavo River crossing, from the slave caravans that routinely crossed said river.\nOther arguments claim that one of the Lions had a badly damaged fang , which made it impossible to hunt bigger , tougher prey , although this has generally been disproved.\nA recent study indicates that one of them had an infection at the root of his canine tooth , which compromised his ability to hunt their usual prey.\nDespite the claim that the Lion had a damaged fang been generally disregarded, it wouldn’t be the first time a big cat has resorted to killing humans as the result of an injury.\nIn 1965 , the “Man-Eater of Darajani” was made infamous after “Outdoor Life” devoted an article to it’s attack on a Kenyan hunter.\nThe only difference with the previous case is that here we know why the Lion resorted to such behaviour , and you’d never guess it. Take your time, try. Ready ?\nAll because of this little fella :\nPictured above : A majestic Crested porcupine\n.\nSee, because cats aren’t stupid they generally don’t assault what is essentially a 4x4 land urchin unless there is an extreme shortage of food.\nBecause even if they win, they can end up looking like this :\nIs that really a W, Simba ?\nIn more extreme instances , the damage caused is so severe that the Lion is effectively crippled, and such an instance is what happened with the Man-Eater of Darajani.\nOnce the Lion was killed , a quill was visibly protruding from it’s snout. Dr Julian Peterhans , a researcher at Chicago’s Roosevelt University , noted that the quill had penetrated more than 15 cm into the cat’s snout, nearly piercing it’s brain.\nDr. Peterhans said that the quill was undoubtedly the reason the lion became a Man-Eater - since the injuries it sustained rendered it unable to hunt , leading it to go after humans as a last resort.\nBut honestly, as grizzly as the above instances are, they can’t compare to the one that follows. You see, as many people the Tsavo Lions killed , their cumulative record is still less than half of the highest number of fatalities caused by a single animal.\nEnter, the “Champawat Devil” .\nBack in the early 1900s , a Bengal Tiger terrorized the residents of a village in Nepal . Due to the pervasive nature of the attacks , hunters were sent to deal with the animal , but were so innefective in tracking down the big cat that the Nepalese army had to step in.\nDespite the tiger still managing to elude them for a while, they eventually managed to drive her out of her territory, which was good news. The bad news is that by swimming across the river Sarda ( Yes, Tigers have no business being that good at swimming ) , she just traded an old territory for a new one , eventually “relocating” in the Kumaon district in India.\nAs if being nigh impossible to track and put down, she was also incredibly adaptable, adjusting her hunting habbits as to best avoid detection. For example ,she would cross huge distances during nightime and kill people from different villages in the Kumaon area .\nAdditionally , she always hunted during the day , which is highly uncharacteristic of ( mostly ) nocturnal animals like Tigers. The situation had gotten so bad that people often refused to leave their houses just at the sound of the Tiger’s roar from the nearby forest.\nEventually , the Tiger was put down by the combined efforts of hunter Jim Corbett and about 300 villagers , ending her reign of terror in 1907. Her final kill count was estimated to be around 436 people.\nAn autopsy on the Tiger revealed that thw upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone.\nThese injuries , which were most likely caused by an old gunshot ( Yes, that was our fault too ) , rendered her unable to hunt her normal prey and humans were an easy bite for her.\nYou can claim these were justified by sustained injuries, but Tigers in general are incredibly petty ( They are cats , after all ) and vengeful animals. There are cases where Tigers have stalked a hunter that did them wrong for 12 + hours only to murk him after. You can read more about it here\n, since this Answer’s long enough as it is.\nBut like, if you’re a poacher you really got what’s coming for you at that point.\nSo, to conclude.\nTigers have a stat advantage over lions in size , weight , strength and bite . They are comparable climbers, leapers and better swimmers. Lions do compensate with higher bone density and hunting in packs, but the Tiger is about as close as you can get to an animal version of Liam Neeson. Wrong one , and it will make it it’s life purpose to end yours.\nFun-Fact : Did you know your pet shares more than 95% of it’s DNA with this roided up Garfield ?\nThanks for reading, take care ✌",
      "7": "Determining which animal is more dangerous, a lion or a tiger, is a complex matter as it depends on various factors. Both lions (Panthera leo) and tigers (Panthera tigris) are powerful predators and possess unique characteristics that contribute to their respective levels of danger.\nLions are known for their social behavior, living in prides and exhibiting cooperative hunting strategies. They have a muscular build, strong jaws, and sharp claws, making them formidable hunters. Lions are skilled at taking down large herbivores, and their strength and aggression can be formidable. However, they are generally more accustomed to human presence due to their historical coexistence with local communities in Africa, which can lead to a degree of habituation and reduced aggression towards humans.\nTigers, on the other hand, are solitary creatures with a reputation for stealth and agility. They are the largest members of the cat family and possess exceptional strength, speed, and powerful jaws. Tigers are known for their ability to ambush prey, often attacking from a concealed position, and they have been observed taking down large animals such as deer, buffalo, and even elephants. Tigers have a well-developed sense of camouflage, and their stripes enable them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, making them highly effective hunters.\nWhen it comes to human encounters, both lions and tigers have been involved in attacks. However, the factors contributing to such incidents can vary, including factors like habitat, prey availability, human population density, and interactions with humans. It's crucial to understand that individual behavior and circumstances play a significant role in determining the danger posed by any particular animal.\nIn terms of recorded attacks on humans, tigers have been involved in more incidents than lions. This may be partially attributed to the greater historical overlap between tiger habitats and human populations in parts of Asia. However, it's important to note that the vast majority of encounters between humans and big cats occur without any harm to humans.\nUltimately, it is difficult to definitively determine which animal is more dangerous, as both lions and tigers possess formidable traits and capabilities. It is vital to respect and appreciate these magnificent creatures in their natural habitats and prioritize efforts to preserve their populations and habitats to minimize human-wildlife conflicts and ensure their long-term survival.",
      "8": "It is challenging to determine which animal is more dangerous, as both lions and tigers are powerful apex predators, and their level of danger depends on various factors, including the specific situation and individual characteristics of the animal. However, some points of comparison can be considered:\nSize and strength: Tigers, particularly Siberian and Bengal tigers, are generally larger and more muscular than lions. This additional size and strength could potentially make tigers more dangerous in a one-on-one encounter.\nSolitary vs. social behaviour: Lions live in social groups called prides, while tigers are solitary animals. Lions might be considered more dangerous in some situations because of their cooperative hunting strategies and the potential for multiple lions to be involved in an attack. However, tigers are highly skilled and stealthy hunters, even without the benefit of group cooperation.\nHuman-animal conflict: Tigers are responsible for more human fatalities than lions, mainly due to their larger distribution across Asia, which brings them into contact with human populations more frequently. However, this does not necessarily mean that tigers are inherently more dangerous than lions; it reflects the circumstances of their interactions with humans.\nIt is essential to remember that both lions and tigers are wild animals, and their behaviour can be unpredictable. While it may be interesting to compare their characteristics, it is crucial to treat both species with respect and caution and prioritize conservation efforts to ensure their survival in the wild.",
      "9": "Welcome to \"Predator Showdown,\" where we explore the fierce and fascinating world of big cats. Today, we're taking a closer look at two of the most iconic predators on earth: lions and tigers. Which one is more dangerous?\nAt first glance, it may seem like an easy question to answer. Lions are known for their strength and ferocity, while tigers are known for their size and power. But the reality is much more complex.\nLet's start with lions. These majestic animals are famous for their manes and their loud roars, which can be heard from miles away. They are also social animals, often living in prides with other lions. This makes them formidable hunters, capable of taking down large prey like zebras and buffalo.\nBut lions are not invincible. They are vulnerable to injury and disease, and they can be outsmarted by their prey or even their competition. In fact, in some areas of Africa, lions are in decline due to habitat loss and human encroachment.\nNow, let's turn to tigers. These massive cats are the largest of all the big cats, with males weighing up to 600 pounds. They are solitary animals, preferring to live and hunt alone. This means that they are often more stealthy and strategic in their hunting tactics, allowing them to take down prey that is much larger than themselves.\nBut tigers are also endangered, with only a few thousand left in the wild. They are threatened by poaching, habitat loss, and human conflict. And while they may be powerful hunters, they are not invincible either. In fact, some tigers have been known to become man-eaters, preying on humans in areas where their natural prey is scarce.\nSo, which animal is more dangerous: a lion or a tiger? The truth is, both animals are incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous. It all depends on the situation and the individual animal. By learning more about these fascinating creatures, we can better appreciate their strength and beauty, and work to protect them and their habitats for generations to come.",
      "10": "Tigers.\nTigers are known for hunting bears, crocodiles, and in some cases even elephants; this is not a small feat, bears are the largest predators on the planet, crocodiles have been here since the age of the dinosaurs and elephants, well…you know…and still it has been recorded (more than once, mind you, it is rare, but it does happen) that tigers at time actively hunt for them…Lions are mighty predators too, mind you, Leopards, Hyenas and Wild Dogs don’t usually pose much threat to an adult lion on 1 on 1, but they are all significantly smaller than Lions are, Tigers on the other hand are hunting down things bigger than themselves; like bears in certain parts of Russia, China and India, Crocodiles in India and a couple of recorded cases of Elephants… Some of those cases have even been recorded on video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28R_T2lOr30\nan adult tiger is 80% muscle, while an adult lion has 60%. This means that in a melee fight, there is almost no chance of really hurting the animal.\nAlso, tigers have in some cases killed purely for personal reasons and are very intelligent…that might sound made up, but there was a recorded case in Russia of a tiger tracking down a poacher, getting inside his cabin, killing his dogs and waiting for him to come back before killing him.\nThis incident was later novelized by John Valiant, but the case was real. A tiger followed a man home, waited for him inside, and then killed him. No such incident has ever been recorded on a lion.\nIn fact, some cases of the opposite have been known with lions, because they are social animals.\nThere have been cases of Lions raised by people and treating them relatively well, even wild lions won’t attack humans if they aren’t desperate by either hunger or risk, that is not the case with Tigers.\nMind you, Lions are still wild animals and apex predators that hunt massive beasts on a regular basis, and so you should not ever try your luck with them either or keep one as pet; but if you were to have a choice and there was no other option, the tiger would be way worse.",
      "11": "A tiger is more dangerous… it is pound to pound stronger and smarter than a lion…\nFor humans: lions generally flee if they spot a human as a evolutionary trait.

      "13": "Tigers are responsible for more human deaths than lions. In fact, according to a study by the World Health Organization, tigers are responsible for more human deaths than any other large cat species.\nThe reasons for this may vary, but one contributing factor is that tigers are generally more solitary and territorial animals, and may perceive humans as a threat to their territory. Additionally, human encroachment on tiger habitats has led to more frequent human-tiger encounters, which can sometimes turn fatal.",
      "14": "It is not accurate to say that one animal is inherently more dangerous than another. Both lions and tigers are apex predators and are capable of causing serious harm to humans or other animals. However, there are a few key differences between these two species that may affect their behavior and level of aggression.\nLions and tigers have different social structures and hunting behaviors. Lions are social animals and live in groups called prides, while tigers are solitary animals. Lions hunt cooperatively in groups and are more likely to take down larger prey, while tigers are solitary hunters and may prey on smaller animals. These differences in social behavior and hunting strategies may influence the level of aggression that these animals exhibit.\nIt is also important to note that the behavior of any wild animal can be unpredictable, and it is never a good idea to approach or try to touch a wild animal, even if it seems docile or friendly. It is always best to observe animals from a safe distance and respect their natural habitats.",
      "15": "Both lions and tigers are apex predators and among the most dangerous animals in the world. Each species has its own unique characteristics and hunting strategies, making them formidable hunters. However, when it comes to comparing the two, it's essential to consider a few factors:\nSize and Strength: Tigers are generally larger and more muscular than lions. A fully grown male tiger can weigh up to 600 pounds (270 kilograms), while a male lion typically weighs around 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms). The larger size and increased strength of tigers can give them an advantage in physical confrontations.\nHunting Tactics: Lions are social animals and often hunt cooperatively in prides. This cooperative hunting behavior allows them to take down larger prey like buffaloes and giraffes. Tigers, on the other hand, are solitary hunters and rely on stealth and ambush to catch their prey.\nTerritorial Behavior: Both lions and tigers are territorial and will defend their territories against intruders. A territorial conflict between two adult male lions or tigers can be highly dangerous, with the potential for fatal injuries.\nNumber of Attacks on Humans: It is challenging to determine which species is responsible for more attacks on humans, as it depends on various factors such as habitat, human presence, and wildlife conservation efforts. However, some studies suggest that tigers may be responsible for slightly more attacks on humans than lions.\nHabitat and Range: Tigers are primarily found in parts of Asia, including India, Russia, and Southeast Asian countries, while lions are mostly found in parts of Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. The distribution of the two species does not significantly overlap, reducing the likelihood of direct confrontations between them in the wild.\nOverall, both lions and tigers are incredibly dangerous animals and should be treated with respect and caution in their natural habitats. It's important to remember that these are wild animals and should not be approached or provoked. In captivity, they should only be handled by experienced professionals in accredited facilities for the safety of both humans and the animals themselves.",
      "16": "Well, let me tell you, it's a tough call between these two ferocious felines. It's like trying to decide between a hotdog with ketchup or mustard - both are dangerous choices for your shirt!\nI mean, on one paw, you have the lion, the king of the jungle, with his majestic mane and intimidating roar. But don't let his good looks fool you, he's got claws that can slice through a watermelon-like butter, and teeth that could give a dentist nightmares.\nOn the other paw, you have the tiger, with its stripy coat and piercing eyes. Sure, it looks like a giant kitty cat that wants to play, but one swipe of those paws and you'll be feeling like a chew toy in no time.\nSo, which one is more dangerous? I don't know about you, but I'm staying far away from both of them and sticking to my plant-based diet. At least I know my salad won't try to eat me! 😂😂😂",
      "17": "Mr Bhuwanesh Arora seems to be biased towards the lion. Is one video going to prove anything?\nDon't you know, that tigers have won 1732 fights with lions, but lions have won a poor 170?\nNow, about who is more dangerous. It depends on how you define the word \"dangerous\"\nWith respect to strength: Tigers are definitely stronger, infact twice as strong as it has been proved. Tigers are more packed with muscles. A Sumatran Tiger they called Chester once fought off 7 lions simultaneously. Titus, the Roman emperor had Bengal tigers compelled to fight African lions and the tigers always beat the lions. So tigers are more dangerous.\nWith respect to stealthy habit: Definitely the tiger. Tigers are more stealthy. It is very difficult to escape a tiger, coz hell, you can't spot it in the jungle even if it is in front of you. Thus it becomes dangerous.\nWith respect to relentless attacks: Now tigers generally avoid unnecessary mess. I mean, try putting a tough cheetah against an average tiger. The tiger shall win as we know, but assuming that the cheetah plays tough, the tiger will back away, and may just escape (I hope you know that cheetahs are the weakest BIG cats and tigers are strongest.) Escaping is a tiger's natural instinct; that doesn't make him a coward. But when a tiger realizes that fighting is the only option, it will attack violently and relentlessly. Not just with a cheetah, but with ANY creature.\nWith respect to ferocity: Tigers are more ferocious than lions; during a fight, they have a genuine fury. This can be seen from their faces!! A lion doesn't get serious from the beginning. To make it a bit clear, you can see that it doesn't straightaway go for the kill, the neck or throat.\nAnd it's crap that tigers aren't warriors. It has been observed that a tiger fights other tigers more than a lion fighting other lions. One must especially see the tiger reserves of India. There you can see how regularly tigers fight other tigers.",

It's important to remember that these animals should be appreciated from a safe distance in their natural habitats, and that any human interaction with them should be done with extreme caution and under the guidance of experienced professionals.",
      "21": "Both tigers and lions can be equally dangerous,",
      "22": "Both are equally dangerous. But the terrain will play a huge deciding factor. In the tropical forests , I think a tiger is more dangerous because of its camouflage. Tigers are barely visible and extremely silent creatures. But this camouflage will not work in the dry jungles of Africa and there the lion would be more dangerous because of its body color matching the soil. In the wild, tigers are generally solitary creatures while lions sometimes hunt as a pride. So one tiger Vs many lions stalking you… I wouldn't want to face either of them when they are angry or hungry!",
      "23": "Tigers prefer to attack from behind which makes it hard to defend. There are people who farm near tiger habitat who wear a bowl like hat with eyes painted on the back side. They say is lessens the chance of attack. Equally dangerous are leopard. They have been known to go through an entire hunting party like a whirlwind after getting tired of being followed. I used to conduct armed walking photo safaris and part of your visual scan while walking in or near woodlands is to be checking branches for any resting leopards. Tall grass is a lion’s best place to ambush from. For that reason, during the wet season we did not conduct walks with guests once the grass was over 2ft tall, as by the time you spot the danger you don’t have time to yell, flap arms and try to look larger to scare off the cat or fire a warning shot to scare them off. If they are already close up and personal, you won’t have time to chamber a round. We would sometimes walk without guests….just a few guides, and if the grass was getting taller, or bush was becoming dense we would sometimes chamber a round and walk with finger on the trigger guard….something we would never do with tourists present. A guide was doing a night drive in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Half way through the tour he couldn’t hold it any longer. He parked the Bedford on a small bridge and told the guests he would be right back from peeing. He ducked down below the bridge (dry season no water). He never returned and the guests heard nothing. Another night drive came by and that guide went down to check it out. Found his rifle laying in the sand, fresh leopard tracks, and some drag marks. They found what the leopard didn’t eat the next day.",
      "24": "This depends on what you mean by most dangerous. If you mean most dangerous to mankind, Tigers routinely kill many more humans than lions do, due to environmental and evolutionary factors. Lions don't usually live close to human settlements and generally don't tend to attack humans (unless they have been deliberately deprived of food, as they were in the Roman colleseums). That's why the two man eating Lions of Tsavo were an outlier for their species and created so much press attention. Lions tend not to like the taste of human flesh. Tigers on the other hand kill hundreds of villagers each year.\nIf you're talking about being a danger to the other species in face-to-face confrontations, as I'm assuming you are, as this is a commonly asked question, the history of this matter is mixed. There have been several instances of fully grown male lions killing adult male tigers. There are also several instances of adult tigers killing fully grown male lions. Tiger fanboys like to pretend that lions have only ever killed female or juvenile tigers. They also blatantly make up statistics about the proportion of tiger victories in interspecies fights and overstate the ability of tigers to take down large prey while underplaying the ability of lions to do so. These are lies designed only to support their sad tiger fetish.\nSimilarly, Lion fanboys like to pretend that the physical qualities that confer a natural (although not decisive) advantage to the tiger don't actually exist and they overplay the importance of lions having been revered throughout the centuries as the king of beasts. Empirical record suggests that it's close to a fifty-fifty split in terms of lion and tiger victories in face-to-face confrontations. There are several other circumstances at play which can affect the outcome of individual encounters. It's important not to get drawn into the propaganda of Lion or Tiger fanboys. They are sad individuals spewing lies and distorting facts on the internet to support their entrenched positions and indulge what is ultimately a tragic little animal fetish. No genuine Zoologist ever takes them seriously. Neither should you.",
      "25": "They both can be extremely dangerous, but I would lean towards the tiger, especially more dangerous towards humans. Tigers are larger, stronger, and have better equipped tools so to speak, so to living close to such populations of humans, tigers have claimed the lives of 373,000 people between 1800 and 2009, and an estimated 1 million people in the last 500 years. Tigers are very territorial and do not take kindly to other predators. They have the largest brain out at all cat species and have the ability to think, learn and plan. That on its own is pretty dangerous.",
      "26": "I would say Tigers as their much bigger and stronger than lions. However, there is no such thing as a more “dangerous” animal any animal will defend itself if it feels threatened by you so, it really depends on the situation. If a cub is present the animals may become alot more fierce and risk attacking you.",
      "27": "On the outside, both Lion and Tiger a big cats. both have almost comparable size, both hunt down preys larger than their size. Also, on the inside both seem the same.\nBut morphological, Tiger has a greater reach with its forepaws due to greater height. while lions are known to hunt in a groups, tigers are mostly solitary ( Curiously a case of group hunting by tigers has been recently reported from India). This difference in tiger behavior makes its far more aggressive than a lion.\nIf history interest you, it may amuse you to know that Akbar the Great, had placed his bet on lion in a staged lion vs tiger fight and lost quite a lot of money.",
      "28": "A lion.\nA lion is far more likely to attack a human, than a tiger, which is only 0.3% likely to be a man-eater.\nAs for which one is more powerful: that’s pretty irrelevant, since no human can fight either one.",
      "29": "If you are against any of the two , you are one the weaker side. If is seen that tigers are lone hunters and they are very powerful compared to lions. They beat lion in terms of weight as well as in strength. Lions are fighters by birth so they might have experience of fighting but male lions do not hunt so they are at disadvantage. There have been many cases where the tiger has killed lion when kept together in zoo. I hope u got the answer.",
      "30": "They both are to me, either one will take a sizeable bite out of your ass so I’d be equally careful and stay clear of either one of them! That’s just me (being silly)",
      "31": "Tigers have a much larger geographic range than lions, and inhabit many more type of environments. This disparity means that tigers have a larger size range, and whether a tiger is stronger than a lion depends on the subspecies.\nThe tiger intended is usually a Bengal tiger, the one from India. These are marginally larger than lions, and therefore stronger.\nAs for fiercer… well, either one could kill you without blinking an eye. We’ll call it even.",
      "32": "If you compare both of them. You will find both having numerous power but if you deeply think who has more strength, stamina, bigger in size. You will find tiger would be in the 1st position and lion also hunts with it's pride whereas tiger on his own\nHOPE IT HELPS TO YOU! 🙏🙏",
      "33": "Head to head both are dangerous. But I would give lion an edge on this because, if you face a tiger face to face you will be in a forest. Either you can put up a valiant fight and die or you can just run and climb a tree and the rest is up to your luck. Most probably you will be dead before you could even turn and run, but in a lucky scenario were you ran and climbed a tree, tiger is probably going to wait some time and after that go away as he realise there is no use waiting for you below. Tigers could climb trees, but they avoid it most of the time. So if you are lucky you could survive. Also tigers are generally solitary and mysterious. They avoid conflict with humans whenever possible. So you can escape from a tiger if you are lucky.\nBut in case of lions its another story. In a similar situation if you are facing a lion you can either put up a valiant one against 5-20 type fight against a pride or if the male see you as a challenge and females do not see you as a threat you can do a one on one with the king of the jungle and die in a brutal brawl without even returning a single blow towards your opponent. Or you can do what you did with tiger. You can run and climb on a tree. Like tiger lion also avoid climbing trees. But there arise a small problem unless you are not dealing with an Indian lion you cant do these. Rest of the lions are in Africa and hell there are no trees where lions rule. They are mostly savannah. So RIP to you cause you definitely cannot outrun these mighty beast who could easily accelerate to 60km/h. The maximum you can run will be 28 mph. That will be like a race between rabbit and tortoise for lion where you are the tortoise and lion is the rabbit who unlike the other stupid rabbit would not stop until he catches you. Originally we are one of the species with superior stamina like dogs and horses. But our lazy life style have brought an end to that golden age where we could run marathon races even with horses and occasionally win. All I am saying is that we are going to die if we are in front of a pissed lion in his territory.\nBut surely we are not going to be that much close with these giant predators in their domain. The only way then there could be a danger is when we are in their domain accidentally and they stalk us. If we saw them first definitely we will run away as we are superior by intelligence and we know we wont win a brawl with these cats. But in this scenario I would say tiger is more dangerous. Both cats are very good stalkers but tiger got a definite edge here. Compared to spotting a tiger in woods, spotting a lion in savannah is piece of cake. If it is dark both cats will kill us without being spotted. Worse we wont even know what hit us. In day light a large lion pride wont go unnoticed by us I guess. But trust me there is nothing like stealth of a tiger. Even if he is in front of us, we wont be able to see it. Also tiger walks without even making a tiny noise. So if you are going for a safari, make sure that there are no hungry tigers there because they are like death itself. Silent and dangerous. They kill with single bite or a swish of their razor sharp claws. I would say in this case a tiger is dangerous.",
      "34": "Among big cats, tiger has the highest ratio of brain over body size. Tiger is more intelligent than a lion. Therefore, it is more dangerous. A lion usually lives in a pride. If you are dealing with only one lion, it is less dangerous than a tiger due to the fact that lions are social and depend on each other.",
      "35": "for who? they are equally non-dangerous for humans as long as humans don’t interfere with their business\nBoth won’t actually harm you as long as you don’t seem to be a threat for them and as long as you behave normally and walk away, they might not even chase you. You are not part of their menu (in rare cases of man eating tigers and lions, it’s a diff story but that’s a rarity and some issue would have cause it rather than being norm)\nFor humans, elephant is the most dangerous animal in fact more than say tiger or lion. In India alone, recorded deaths from elephants number between 150 and 200 per year.\nAccording to the environment ministry, 1,144 people were killed in attacks across India in 1,143 days between April 2014 and May 2017. Elephants accounted for 1,052 human deaths and tigers 92, according to the figures released.\n[BTW The ministry said 345 tigers and 84 elephants were killed in the same period, mostly in poacher attacks.]",
      "36": "Tiger , of course. Due their considerably larger size and better features through adaptations it easily overshadows the lion. It's thoroughly evident that tigers have killed more people than any other predatory mammal .And with that it comes along with an excellent camouflage, excellent swimming, highly resistant to diseases and hunting tactics better than other mammalian predators.\nI come from India where both of these predators exist in wild . They actually had to get Asiatic lions a special sanctuary where there were no tigers , because it was well known tigers basically wiped lions out of competition in many regions across the subcontinent even before hunting for game by royalty and colonial officers accelerated downfall of their numbers.",
      "37": "Arguably yes, Tigers in general can be more \"ferocious\" than lions. The logic is simple - Tigers are normally solitary creatures; lions are social. Tigers are bigger, stronger and faster than lions and have fewer methods to fall back on if they fail to protect their cubs than lions. The social nature of lions can also make them unexpectedly timid, depending on their personality! Tigers can be social too, but in general this has been caused by their habitat loss pushing them in closer proximity.",
      "38": "Both are extremely territorial carnivores that would eat anything that tastes like flesh when they’re hungry, including human beings (that would be us!), although they generally prefer larger wild animals as their prey base.\nIf you’re talking about wild specimens, here’s a comparison between these 2 beasts and how they behave:\nLions are the only felines capable of developing complex social relationships, so they will value if an animal which is weird-looking is threatening or not, since they generally aren’t used to humans. But the situation can get more hairy if you catch a lion eating its kill, but most of the time it will see a human being more like a competitor rather than a prey, so if it charges at you, that would be more likely a mock charge. If you watch the videos of Kevin Richardson on YouTube, he will tell you how to behave when you run into a pride of lions, since he managed to understand them and even make them as friends.\nTigers are solitary animals, at least most of the time, and they’re extremely territorial, have an extreme prey drive and are more unpredictable than lions, because they would eat anything that smells like flesh for them. They don’t have developed complex social relationships like lions, and so this is why you can’t try to do with tigers what Kevin Richardson did with lions. They tend to attack their prey or even competitor catching it off guard, so if you run into a tiger, go for the eyes, as it will value if to attack you or not, but most of the time it will leave.",
      "39": "Are we just talking dangerous in terms of physical prowess or dangerous as is towards humans?\nTigers have a much larger record of being \"man-eaters.\"",
      "40": "The most dangerous animal in the world is the one standing in front of you, licking its chops and thinking about dinner. The most dangerous snake, spider, scorpion etc., is the venomous one that has just bitten you. Nothing else matters. The deadliest creature in the world may simply walk on by, ignoring you completely, in which case, for all its ferocity or venom, it’s not dangerous at all at that particular juncture. Tomorrow, or some other time, may be different and you could end up dead.\nThen we must ask more dangerous to what? Different times, places and creatures need different techniques. Lion normally hunt out in the open, whereas tigers tend to ambush. So, as you can see, it all depends.",
      "41": "More dangerous to what? To a person? Both will kill you in a matter of seconds. Both are extremely powerful and will always depend upon the individual cats personality or temperament.\nGoogle lion named Mr. T ,, Probably one of the most aggressive, meanest lion. Hi. And his brothers killed more of their own kind than in such a short period they became famous.\nSo hopefully you don't meet up with a lion like him.\nI'm sure there's tigers that are meaner than other tigers. Like that one that jumped at the guide on that elephant, he wasn't in a good mood.\nOr that lion that went after some guys that were shooting at him.\nSo don't believe someone that just says tigers are because they think there stronger or have a higher bite force.",
      "42": "Tigers are much less territorial than lions. Tigers are also typically harder to see than lions as lions are usually more likely to be out in the open.\nAs far as threats to humans go, if you stay out of tiger populated jungles, its unlikely the tiger is going to go after you by running out of the jungle to kill you. With lions, they are much more likely to go after you if you get close to their territory, especially during certain times of the year when their mating drive is cranked up a notch.\nHere are some unlucky Cheetah’s that experienced this-\nIts the first time lions were seen going after other creatures as large as Cheetah’s, just because the Cheetah’s were too close, even when they were clearly not threats, and it was a pretty big deal to see this happen as lions had never displayed this level of aggression with regards to just killing for the sake of killing with no intent to eat their victims. It was very “human-esque” of them to do so and debunked many of the claims that “only humans kill for the sake of xxxxx”. Not even the famed “Mamma Bear” has shown this dedicated and predatory level of attention towards killing another non threatening creature with no intent of eating it afterwards. There was no desire to simply drive the cheetah’s away, the lions wanted them dead dead dead.",
      "43": "depends on your defention of dangerous.\ntigers beat lions in terms of strength and size,but lions are more agile and are faster. but in terms of agression,tigers are by far ahead of lions. they have killed more humans then any other cat.\nso to us,the tiger is more dangerous. but if either cat is stalking you,and has the desire of eating you,you will not know unless its too late….",
      "44": "It depends on which of them you pissed off. Both lions and tigers are potentially dangerous but they do not attack humans unless they are hurt, provocated or they are feeling threaten by them",
      "45": "Carpophorus, one of the few Bestiarii[1] we have information from, wrote that he would much rather face a lion than a tiger. He could tell about half a second before a lion leapt that it was going to do so, thus giving him a chance to brace himself and get his shield into the lion's path, but he could never work out when a tiger was about to spring.\n[1] Bestiarii (singular Bestiarius) were Romans who specialised in fighting wild animal in Roman arenas such as the Colosseum. They were less highly regarded than Gladiators, which is hard to believe when they might be fighting lions one day and crocodiles the next, requiring very different styles of fighting whilst gladiators learnt one style only. In one games, Carpophorus is reported as having killed twenty animals in one day, including a lion, a leopard, and a bear.",
      "46": "Lions are smaller and less powerful than tigers but lions hunt in packs and can take down any animal, including elephants and hippos, a tiger cannot. So lions, as a species, are more dangerous.",
      "47": "It doesn’t matter which one’s more dangerous. They both have sharp teeth and claws, weigh over 400 lbs, and sport a powerful predatory instinct.\nThey’re both dangerous and deadly as hell.",
      "48": "The Tiger is only slightly bigger than a lion despite weighting several hundred pounds more. This indicates strength of the Tiger is greater due to higher muscle density.\nThe tiger is more used to fighting one on one than the lion. Giving the tiger the edge. Tiger is arguably a more aggressive and fast fighter. This is evident in the fact that Tigers regularly take on game that is far larger and stronger than a Lion and is capable of doing so alone. while the Lion requires the prides help for such things.\nExperts state that “On average tigers are larger, but more importantly they are more capable of fighting standing on their hind legs”\nExamples of tiger vs lion fights is an account that happened March 2011, where a tiger at the Ankara Zoo attacked a lion through its enclosure and killed the lion with a single paw swipe. “The tiger severed the lion’s jugular vein in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood”, officials said. In 1857, a tiger at the Bromwich Zoo broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued: the lion’s mane saved his head and neck from being injured, but the tiger succeeded in ripping up his stomach, and within a few minutes he was dead. At the Coney Island Zoo in 1909, a male tiger killed a male lion.\nIt does depend on the individual but I think the tiger is more naturally gifted in strength and fighting. While most experts agree that tigers are significantly more aggressive.",
      "49": "I will say marginally.\nBoth are almost the same in structure with Tiger having the weight advantage.\nLion averages around 180 kg\nWhile Tiger averages at around 220 kg\nLion is slightly taller.\nBut weight adds up to strength rather than the shoulder height.\nSo due to that 40 plus kgs in average weight I will say tiger is marginally stronger than lion.",

The whole reason of the Constitution is not the government extending you privileges it RIGHTS we are born with and government cannot take away.\nAlso the last time I checked Colt firearms was a privately held company just as Smith and Wesson, Springfield etc then there is Sig Saur, Glock, Berreta etc which are foreign owned private businesses. Where in this universe did you get the idea government owns all firearms? Does government own all cars? Any gun I buy, trade for, am given as a present is MY property and you taking my property is theft.",
      "2": "You are a special kind of stupid if you really believe that. The government does not own private firearms and owning them is a right, not a privilege. The government is suppose to work for us, not try to make us their subjects. If you ever try to confiscate anything from anyone you will likely end up pushing up daisies!",
      "3": "Because you have ZERO authority to do so. What would you think if I “confiscated” your car because of all of the accidents?",
      "4": "I did not purchase anything from the government. My guns are my own. I know this is a tough concept for a commie to follow but we still believe in private property here. The right to bear arms is not revocable. It is an inalienable right that the bill of rights says the government is not allowed to have any say over. Quit being a troll for attention",
      "5": "Edit to add (in case you don’t understand the quote):\nGuns are NOT owned by the government.\nThe right (not privilege) of private ownership of guns is protected by the 2nd Amendment.\nGun ownership is only revocable in very limited circumstances (e.g. committing a felony.)",

      "10": "Seriously? As I am sure has been explained to you many times, the Supreme Court has ruled on yours and my right to have arms. But additionally if you TAKE property, even if you thought it to be yours (much less the government) you can go to jail. Ask OJ? He took a gun to get his property back and I think he did 10 years for it.\nHe unlawfully used a gun. That is different. What you propose is unlawfully taking the property of others. Like OJ you go to jail.\nGive it up. The law is what the Court says, not what you feel.",
      "11": "Let’s start with a definition.\nTheft is the taking of another person’s personal property with the intent of depriving that person of the use of their property.\nI bought and paid for my guns with money I earned, at a gun store of my choosing. The government has never owned my guns. They are my personal property. According to the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution, the highest law of this country, I have the right to keep and bear arms.\nSo, based on the definition of theft above, you taking my firearms for any reason, without my express permission, constitutes theft. Your reasons are irrelevant, just your intent, which is to take my property. Further, in most states, theft of a firearm is considered Grand Theft.\nEnjoy your stay in one of our wonderful correctional institutions for the next several years.",

Now for the answer to this statement in the guise of a question.\nAs a gun owner I have NEVER once said you or anyone else was a thief for attempting to steal my firearm from my home. When you enter my home I have no idea what the reason for you being there. However I will assume of course you are in my home for one reason. To cause my family harm. Because when you enter my home unannounced and or uninvited you have deftly committed suicide. So call yourself a hero, or a what ever else you would like but at the end of the day you are nothing more than a petty liberal criminal who has invaded my domicile.

I know you leftists out there want to turn the United States into your communist utopia, but that will never happen as long as the 2nd Amendment exists- which is the real reason the left wants to get rid of it. I will not say you have committed theft if you try to confiscate my firearm- no, I will not put such a dirty little label upon you. I will simply inform your family that you committed suicide. Suicide by stupidly trying to deprive a member of society of their RIGHT to keep and bear arms; suicide by trying to forcibly confiscate a firearm from a lawfully armed citizen. It is the same as “suicide by cop” but with less wildly fired bullets that hit everything else and only manage to land 10% of the rounds on target- but it is still enough to kill the person. You will absorb 100% of the rounds fired in this manner of suicide and there will only be a few shots fired.",
      "21": "You would be committing firearm theft, that is the simple truth. Firearm theft is a felony. In my state, Nevada, a single count of firearm theft can result in 10 years in prison. Nevada is not California; we are not nice to criminals.\nYour “public safety” argument is 100% pure horseshit. Nobody would be safe if the government owned all of the guns. Nobody is more untrustworthy and dangerous than the government.\nGun ownership has been a revokable privilege for decades.

That would involve swearing to abide by things like the Second Amendment, possible a state constitution with a right to self defense clause, and to faithfully execute the laws. Oh, and by the way, when some people in redcoats tried to revoke this privilege the last time around, we decided to become an independent nation with no such nonsense.",
      "25": "Okay, I'm going to humor your idiotic statement for a moment. Let's just say that guns are property of the government, they're still not, but for the sake of this we will say they are. If a private citizen has a firearm that means they are authorized, and have been issued one, by the government. Are you a government official acting on authorization to confiscate guns when the citizen’s ownership has been revoked? No, you are not, so you are now committing theft of government property, because you confiscated it without the proper authority, which is still a felony. You still go to federal prison and the gun owner gets their government issued weapon replaced or returned. Your gun grabbing tactics fails again, dumbass.",
      "26": "Please cite the statute where it says that all guns are owned by government? I bet you can’t, because it doesn’t exist. The federal government isn’t even permitted to require registration of guns currently owned by the public.\nHowever, even if they were, you’d still be breaking the law if you attempted confiscation. Unless you’re an agent of government, you’d have no authority to take anything from anyone. If indeed guns were owned by government, gun owners would still required to protect them from theft.\nThis is one of the more ridiculous questions I’ve ever seen.",

      "28": "Best troll yet!!!",
      "29": "No arms in private citizens hands are owned by the government in the United States. They are the property of the citizen. Yes there are some things a gun owner could do to make them prohibited but you are not law enforcement and that would be missing a thing called due process. Now for you to attempt to steal a gun from someone you either assaulted them or broke in their house both of which are illegal. If somehow you are successful which I doubt, theft of a gun is a serious felony both state and federal. So you get to enjoy your new government housing with your roommate named Bubba where your new “friends” shall enjoy your company.

    "answers": {
      "1": "China is known for its diverse and sometimes exotic cuisine, which can include ingredients and dishes that might seem unusual or unappetizing to people from other countries. Here are some examples:\n1. **Century Eggs (Pidan):** These are preserved duck eggs that are aged for several weeks or even months. The yolk turns greenish-black and the white becomes translucent, resulting in a distinctive and strong flavor.\n2. **Stinky Tofu (Chou Doufu):** This is fermented tofu that has a strong, pungent odor. It's popular in parts of China but can be quite off-putting to those unfamiliar with it.\n3. **Bird's Nest Soup (Yan Wo):** Made from the nests of swiftlets, these nests are composed of solidified saliva. They are soaked and used to make a luxurious soup known for its high price and unique texture.\n4. **Balut (Lu Dan):** While not originally Chinese (it's more common in Southeast Asia), it's sometimes available in certain regions. It's a fertilized duck egg with a partially developed embryo, often eaten boiled.\n5. **Scorpion Skewers (Xie Kao):** In some night markets, you can find skewered and fried scorpions. They are crispy and can be quite popular with adventurous eaters.\n6. **Snake Soup (She Geng):** This is a traditional Cantonese dish made from snake meat. It's believed to have health benefits, but the idea of consuming snake might be strange to some.\n7. **Sea Cucumbers (Hai Sen):** These marine animals have a gelatinous texture and are considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. Some find their texture unusual.\n8. **Bee Larvae and Pupae (Feng Zhong, Feng Liao):** In certain regions, especially Yunnan, bee larvae and pupae are eaten. They are often fried or used in soups.\n9. **Duck Tongues (Ya She):** Duck tongues are a popular dish in some parts of China, especially in Sichuan cuisine. They are typically seasoned and stir-fried.\n10. **Frog Legs (Qing Wa Tui):** While not unique to China, frog legs are commonly eaten in certain regions. Some people may find the idea of eating amphibians unusual.\nIt's important to note that food preferences are highly subjective, and what may seem strange or unappetizing to one person might be considered a delicacy by another. If you're traveling in China and want to try local foods, it's always a good idea to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to explore new flavors and textures.",
      "2": "China is known for its diverse cuisine, but there are a few strange foods that might not appeal to foreigners. One such example is stinky tofu, a fermented tofu dish with an intense odor that can be off-putting for those unaccustomed to it. Another peculiar delicacy is century eggs, which are preserved eggs that turn black and have a jelly-like texture. These eggs may not be everyone’s cup of tea due to their strong ammonia-like smell and unique flavor. Additionally, scorpions on skewers or deep-fried insects might be a challenging choice for those with more conservative palates. However, don’t fret!

      "1": "The Blue Falcon. That kind of bird is universally hated. It is an initialism for “buddy fscker”, i.e. someone who gets his buddies into trouble for his own benefit. Typical blue falcons are rats, thieves, snitches and incompetent soldiers who attempt to cover their own incompetence by pushing the responsibility of their own screw-ups on someone else.\nThe bully. Unfortunately, these guys tend to settle as noncoms. They are universally hated. I did a nasty shenanigan to one of my drill corporals just before the boot camp ended. I was told to polish his parade shoes, and so I did. I squeezed then a liberal amount of shoe polish inside his other shoes so that when he’d put those shoes on, his feet would get smeared with the shoe polish. It was too late to punish me anymore, and there would be no evidence it had been me who had done that shenanigan.\nThe whiner. The one who complains all the time and whines and attempts to avoid service. Not only do they prove they are the weakest link of the chain, but their behaviour may get the other soldiers in trouble (in which case you have #1).\nThe lazybum. The one who shuns and intentionally avoids the service, the hardships and the tasks, and pushes them on behalf of the others. See #1.\nThe overtly intellectual. Yes, I was in trouble myself. The reason is that overtly intellectual soldiers (Stanine 9) tend not to blend in, they are easy to spot and they tend to question everything. While they will make excellent offficers and specialists, they are also potential troublemakers. I later got to know the Finnish military puts every recruit with Stanine 9 on special surveillance, to sieve out potential troublemakers, because a disgruntled intellectual can cause a lot of damage by sabotage. It gets better in the specialist training, though.\nThe hygienically challenged. Keeping your personal hygiene is a must. Not only it is the most trivial form of being polite to your buddies, but bad hygiene on field will lead into diseases and other troubles. My hubby told that he had, during his own service, had a dorm mate who had to be forcefully dragged to shower and to the quartermaster to have his filthy clothes replaced.\nThe troublemaker. I had later a hair-trigger temper boy in the platoon I commanded, and he was a real troublemaker. Not only he was almost on weekly basis in the brig, but he also got in fights with boys of different units. I really did not want anyone to get in trouble with him.\nThe load. The incompetent conscript who has little talent and who must be shepherded everywhere like a child and who is more a nuisance than of any benefit for the unit. Think of Pvt. Riitaoja in The Unknown Soldier\n, and you get the idea.\nThe substance abuser. They are complete loose cannons. They not only get the unit under suspicion, but can endanger the performance of the whole unit and cause unnecessary problems. Fortunately there is always the option of dishonourable discharge and getting drummed out.\nThe rebel without a cause. Yes, conscription is basically slavery, and it is one of the greatest tragedies of the humankind. Yet negative attitude on everything and ‘in your face’ or ‘I don’t care a 5hit’ mindset is not only going to get you in troubles, but also the other servicepersons. Fortunately these boys are usually drummed out already during the boot camp.",
      "2": "The most hated soldier in the Army is the Blue Falcon, the buddy fucker.\nThis can range from snitching on other soldiers, to getting other soldiers killed.\nA soldier is part of a team. We share the workload, share successes and failures. Everyone hates the guy who makes himself more comfortable or safer at the expense of his fellow soldiers.",
      "3": "Thieves - From day one in basic training, we were told to keep our belongings (both personal and military) properly secured. “Don’t tempt thieves” was the line provided. If you are found - or even suspected of - stealing from your fellow soldiers, expect a very thorough (and well-deserved) kicking. You’ll also lose any prayer of being trusted in future.\nThe lazy - There are shirkers, jerkers and workers. Shirkers avoid all work, jerkers only work when they’re being watched and workers pitch in and ensure that they do at least their fair share of the work. When I was an NCO, hell awaited if I thought you were lacking in the proper motivation to do your job.\nThose who lacked good hygiene - In the Army, you share very limited personal space with many others. This requires making sure that a lack of personal hygiene standards wasn’t going to cause illness to others. If you were a “gumper”, you could possibly expect a (very illegal) “regimental bath”, where you’d be dumped in a bathtub full of floor cleaner and scrubbed with a yard broom until you’d learned your lesson.\nThe W.I.M.P.s (Whining Incompetent Malingering Person) - These are the ones who are always complaining that they’re too sick or unable to do things, yet somehow manage to be first in the line to eat, and can be seen scoffing chips and beer. I’ve seen some “soldiers” who spent more time on sick parade than they did any form of military work.\nOfficers who can’t read maps/perform drill correctly/lead/plan ahead - Actually, there were lots and lots of them. I’m just joking…\n… but only just.",
      "4": "This will be a long list. When I was a paratrooper in the German Army, we didn’t like:\nAnyone who wasn’t a paratrooper or at least infantry. We called them “Fehlfarben” (wrong colors) or “Luschen” (sissies).\nWe especially despised LRRPs (Long Range Reconnaissance and Patrol) soldiers. They thought that they were better than us, but they weren’t.\nWe also didn’t like our fellow paratroopers from other battalions, especially those that came from the two battalions that were garrisoned in the town of Nagold. There was a healthy competition between each paratrooper unit which one was the best (of course, my battalion was number one) and the guys from Nagold were a bunch of losers, better suited for a kindergarten.\nIn our own battalion, we didn’t like everyone from the 1. Company (staff and administration). They were called “Stabsmuffel”(Staff pooper).\nMe and my NCO (Non-Commissioned Officers) buddies also weren’t too friendly with the NCOs from our 3rd company. These guys were just extremely stupid. We went along much better with the NCOs from the other companies.\nIn my own company, we didn’t like the Company Sergeant Major (called “Spiess” in German). He was in charge of the discipline in our unit and therefore we thought of him as an a-hole.\nOn a more personal note, I didn’t like:\nPeople who shied away from difficult tasks (and left the job for someone else to finish).\nGuys who complained too much. I also didn’t trust guys who never complained.\nOf course, I also didn’t like rats and liars. Fortunately, we didn’t have any in our unit.\nIn my Croatian Defense Council unit during the Bosnian War we didn’t like:\nPrimitive local soldiers who had a problem with our alcohol and drug habits. First, we called them cavemen, but some of them understood a little English and therefore, we switched to garage people.\nThe Sergeant Major in charge of the discipline in the barracks. I think this guy is universally hated in every army.\nSoldiers from the 2nd Guards Brigade (we were 1st Guards Brigade), because they had the better equipment.\nGuys who ask you to lend them some money and never pay it back.\nLiars. Almost every new guy who wanted to join our unit told us that he had served in the French Foreign Legion. We had a few former legionnaires in our platoon and it took them less than one minute to identify the frauds.\nAnd in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA):\nWith a few exceptions, we didn’t like the other soldiers in our brigade. We called them “pensionistat” (retirees). They didn’t have the same fighting spirit that we possessed.\nWe also despised most KLA commanders. A lot of them were illiterate peasants who had no idea about guerrilla warfare.\nWe hated soldiers who lied to us about the combat situation. There was a local KLA soldier who told us that a certain village was free of enemy forces. When we went there ten minutes later, we got shot at. You can lie about almost anything and I don’t care, but not about the tactical situation!\nRead this answer in another language: Antwort von Roland Bartetzko auf Welche Art von Soldat mögen andere Soldaten nicht?",
      "5": "I think this question has been pretty well answered by several people, but there is one type that I really disliked when I was in. This was the person that demanded that you respect them, no matter how bad they were as a person (especially an NCO). We had one in particular, a female E-5 who was our NBC NCO. Now ladies, before you jump down my throat I have served with some of the most hardcore women soldiers anywhere… people that I would take into combat at any time because I knew they would have my back… but this SGT wasn’t one of them. We were packing up to go to the field when we had to make a detail to go assist her with her NBC equipment. She had complained to the 1SG that she had tons of gear to load up in the trailer but nobody to help her. When the detail got to her she hadn’t packet a single thing in the trailer. She then stood around and gave orders on what to pack and how to pack it while the detail guys did all of the work. When someone said something to her about helping out she said she was an NCO and we had to respect her rank and yadda yadda yadda… we had a bitch session with the 1SG when we got back from the field and that event came up. It was brought up to her that while we respected her rank, she had never earned any respect personally.\nAt the tail end of my career I was an OC/T stationed at Ft Knox, KY. Our mission was to train NG and USAR units that were preparing to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. One unit in particular comes to mind. It was an infantry unit that had female drivers for their armored HMVWWs. These women were admin from the BN HQ, but because of a shortage of drivers they had been sent down to drive for the patrol platoons. There were three that I remember that were hardcore as all get out. They carried .50 cal MG’s out the to trucks, helped them get set up, and just generally worked their asses off. They listened to instructions, and learned from the training. They were BOSS. I was a senior OC/T in charge of training that platoon and I told their platoon sergeant (in front of those female soldiers) that he was lucky to have such dedicated troops and that I would be proud to serve with them anywhere.",
      "6": "Some great answers here. I am going to add two:\nPT Studs who suck at their jobs. Note that the Army cares far more about how good you are at PT than they do about your job competency. This started in the 1980s and has continued. Many of us technically very competent people hated watching the worthless PT Studs get promoted and get awards over those of us who cared about being good at our jobs.\nLeaders at all levels who do not have their soldier’s backs. This is endemic now, back in the day, more often than not, your leader had your back if you were a good soldier. Initiative was encouraged and mistakes seen as learning opportunities. Now, everything is micromanaged to a ridiculous degree and if you make an unauthorized decision or make a mistake, you are screwed. This really hit me hard when I returned to the service after being out 18 years. I made what I thought was a simple “sergeant level” decision and I thought the world was going to end right there. I also found that backing up my soldiers was not good for my own career. Leaders are expected to throw their soldiers to the wolves routinely.",
      "7": "One of the first things that strikes you when you join the military (especially if you are young and haven't been away from home much) is the fact the armed services are a true melting pot.\nIt was actually more like a melting pot mixed with the UN. We had white guys from the midwest, black guys from the city, guys of Asian descent from the west coast, guys from New England whose accent was so strong we couldn’t understand them. You get the picture.\n**Note the wide variety of individuals behind the President as he is speaking. You have white guys, black guys, Hispanic guys, white women, black women…this is not accidental. Those soldiers didn’t just happen to be standing there. They were placed because of their ethnic backgrounds and/or gender. We used to call it, “the wall of diversity”.\nWe had one guy that was North Vietnamese whose family escaped to the US after the fall of Saigon. There was a Scottish soldier from the British Army training with us. We had a guy from the El Salvadoran Army.\n**Scots wearing the tam o’ shanter. The would get really pissed if you poked fun at their headgear.\nI didn’t witness much prejudice based on where someone was from or the color of their skin. Some people had enough personal issues that you just didn’t care for them much based solely on their disturbing behavior.\nThe following are the types of soldier that most troops didn’t like much:\nThe High Strung Ultra Gung Ho Guy - This soldier always has a stern look on his face like he’s ready to rip someone’s throat out. He’ll let anyone within earshot know that he intends to be at the top of the class. He’ll try to do this at the cost of others, therefore he is almost universally hated. This guy doesn’t want to fit into the group. He is commonly referred to as an asshole.\n**Asshole\nThe Blue Falcon - Probably the worst of the worst. Blue Falcon is code for buddy fucker. He’ll screw you over for any reason or no reason at all. He is the antithesis of a team player. Think Bowe Bergdahl. He often gets what’s coming to him in the end and may be the guest of honor at a blanket party.\n**Bowe Bergdahl and his new buddy ready for a night out on the town in Kabul.\nThe Complainer - We get it, being in the armed forces can really suck at times. You get cold, wet, hungry…your feet hurt, everyone is yelling at you. This is supposed to be a test of your character. You suck it up and function at a high level despite the adversity. The complainer doesn’t do this. He bitches about everything. “My boots are too tight. This food sucks! We have to do another ruck march? I know that bastard checking weapons is just going to hand it right back to me.” He is often told in a loud voice to STFU.\n**Some guys would even complain about the type of MRE they got\nThe Braggart - He’ll tell you everything about himself that you never wanted to know. He was the quarterback of his college football team, he’s won numerous shooting awards and is president of his local Mensa chapter. Yeah, right, whatever. Just get away from me. When it is go time they can’t make it over the first wall of the obstacle course. You look at your buddies and roll your eyes. I saw one “star athlete” who could barely throw your standard M67 fragmentation grenade farther than the 15-meter casualty radius. For the love of God and all that is holy they only weigh 14 ounces (396 grams).\n**The braggart scared the shit out of us on the grenade range",
      "8": "In a nutshell, those that are 'Jack', in other words they look after number one (themselves) and don't consider the needs of their fellow soldiers. The term, 'Jack brew' was often used when I served referring to someone who only made themselves a cup of tea and didn't make brews for their mates too.",
      "9": "Unpopular opinion here, but I hate the soldiers, especially leaders who won’t cut soldiers a little bit of slack or understanding.\nAs an example, the unit I’m assigned to has a few PT failures. They’ve been taking remedial PT tests every month at drill to ensure they’re working on PT throughout the month. Well now that it’s November, in Montana, we’ve had snow in some parts of the state for awhile. One soldier who has failed has had difficulty running outside to prepare for the 2 mile run due to his location having so much snow already. However, he finds ways to improve; jump ropes, boxes, tries to do cardio however he can. Now, he hasn’t passed yet, but he’s definitely improving. And every single month when he fails, his squad leader comes down on him hard and rips him a new one and makes him feel like shit. Now I’m not saying he shouldn’t be disciplined, or that we shouldn’t make him a little uncomfortable. But being a leader is identifying who you are leading, and knowing how to motivate them to get the job done. This is not how you motivate this soldier because then he views it as the work he does put in isn’t recognized.\nSo in my opinion, I can’t generally stand leaders who have a cookie cutter leadership mentality, every soldier and person is different, it’s up to the job of a leader to find how to help reach their own potential.",
      "10": "The military is very cliquish. Some things are obvious: The rank on your sleeve/collar; gender; race. I’ll get back to a couple of those items that are probably of more interest to the general public in a bit.\nBut first:\nI was in the US Army, MI for 4 years active duty. It seems very odd now, looking back, but at the time it felt normal the way we divided ourselves. Looking back I feel like I was a subject in a psychological experiment: Here’s the scenario; This is your role; These people are your friends, Those people aren’t your friends, etc.\nAs a general rule officers and enlisted did not socialize. Officers met after-hours at the officer club. As an enlisted man, I never stepped foot in the officer club. In my unit the enlisted met at the ‘NCO club’. Dating between ranks was a no-no. A Lt Colonel could not date a private. It was against the rules. There might have been some such relationships, but it had to be done in secret.\nI was a 98C - Electronic Signals Intelligence Analyst. I was also sent to the Defense Language Institute in Monterrey CA to learn Farsi. I was in during the 80s, so I don’t know how things are now in MI. Probably basically the same.\nAt DLI there were people from all service branches and also some civilians (probably CIA, though this was not known by us). There would be no socializing with the civilians in training. Also little socializing with members of other branches. We each lived in different barracks, so didn’t have day-to-day life in common.\nOf the Army students there were the 98Cs - who learned whatever languages they learned - along side with 98Gs (straight linguists), and then the interrogators. Even though we were all US Army enlisted soldiers in the same classes, there was a sense that people with different MOSes were different. 98Cs generally thought that 98Gs were slackers because their training after DLI was shorter. At the time the next step of the training for 98Cs and Gs was done at Goodfellow AFB in Texas. The interrogators went to Ft. Huachuca in Arizona. This was probably unfair, but the 98C/G attitude was that interrogators were people who wanted to brow-beat prisoners. We thought they must have been sadists. After DLI I didn’t keep in touch with any of the interrogator school-bound guys I got to know. Back then there was no Facebook or smart phones.\nThere was a deeper divide between the linguists of MI and the other specialties within MI - Morse Code interceptors (05Hs), etc. I never learned how to do Morse Code. They did it, then passed it on to guys like me. 98Cs/Gs did not socialize much with 05Hs. They didn’t understand what we did, like we couldn’t do what they did. There wouldn’t have been much shop talk. Most after-hours talk at the NCO club was shop talk.\nThis feeling of difference was more pronounced in the broader Army when us MI guys encountered soldiers from other branches - mechanics, supply, combat arms, etc. The attitudes of MI officers and NCOs toward subordinates was pretty relaxed. We weren’t harangued about how well polished our boots or how well pressed our dress uniforms were - unless they were really bad. I got the impression that combat arms types thought we were a bunch of sloppy prima donnas who weren’t serious about real soldier stuff. Compared with them this was true. The general attitude of MI soldiers to soldiers in other branches was that they were too dumb to handle our training, which in a lot of cases, was true.\nAm I being cliquish here? Yes.\nCo-located with my MI battalion was an MP (Military Police) company. There was not much socializing between MPs and MI guys. The MPs were the guys who opened your barracks room door at 2 AM accompanied by a drug-sniffing dog. “DO NOT TRY TO PET THE DOG.” Jerks. This is probably nonsense: One story I heard was that the MPs were with us to make sure that us MI types (who had Top-Secret security clearances) would not be taken prisoner. It was whispered that they would kill us if our battalion was about to be overrun in a combat situation. Like I say, nonsense. Probably. In any case, their presence made me paranoid.\nOften the soldier who doesn’t hang out with the people he’s expected to is shunned. Examples I promised to get back to: race and sex. In my Permanent Duty Station the chow hall seating was divided by race - the blacks sat on one side, the whites the other. There was no assigned seating. People sat where they wanted to sit. Between the white side and the black side there would be a row or two of tables in the middle that no one sat at. Sound like a prison movie? I sat with other whites. There were a couple of black guys who sat with us. I had the impression they didn’t like the other blacks. I also had the impression that the other blacks ostracized them. I don’t remember any whites sitting with blacks. Racism? Maybe. But not so in most cases. But there was some tension. I don’t recall there being more than a few Hispanics in my battalion. They kept to themselves.\nThe Army was not a woman-friendly environment. Women had a slacker standard for physical fitness - measured by how many push-ups/sit-ups one could do in 2 minutes and how fast one could run two miles. I was no athlete, but I was able to outdo an overwhelming majority of the women. Though they might be in the same MOSes, women would be given easier physical tasks - instead of setting up camouflage netting they might be tasked with organizing office supplies, etc. A lot of men resented this.\nNot often talked about in these PC times: pregnant women in the military. Of the lower ranked enlisted women I knew who got pregnant, all ended up being single moms. In my company there was a squad composed of pregnant women and new mothers, most were regarded as worthless. They were excused from having to do a lot of things - daily PT, for example. They couldn’t be expected to deploy, leaving their kids back in the US/non-war zones. Most of them discharged before their enlistments expired. It was commonly believed that many women deliberately got pregnant so they could get discharged.\nGays? The Army didn’t want to know about them. They did not out themselves. Being an open gay would have resulted in an immediate “other than honorable” discharge. I knew one guy in my company who was a transvestite. His roommate said he found some Nerf footballs that were cut in half (to stuff bras) and a ‘shemale’ goods catalog. The roommate reported him and he disappeared. There was no chance for ‘goodbyes’. It’s funny how politics affect our perceptions. When the military’s approach to gays was changed from FORBIDDEN to “don’t ask, don’t tell”, the thought I had at the time was that this was very liberal. I thought “This should make everyone happy.” Now we hear that that it was meant to keep gays in the closet. I don’t believe that.\nAnyway, I’ve gone on long enough.",

      "12": "There are numerous “types” of soldiers.\nBlue Falcon, Bravo Foxtrot, or Buddy F*cker (they are all the same). This is the soldier that steals from others, gets others in trouble, doesn’t work as part of the team, and essentially doesn’t do anything to help anyone else, regardless of how hard it makes it on the others.\nThe Skater: This soldier is similar to a blue falcon only they aren’t intentionally trying to make other soldiers lives hell. They just don’t care. They want to be lazy all day and not do anything. While everyone else is out doing their job they are hiding out and avoiding anyone with enough rank to order them to do their job.\nThe Professor: This soldier isn’t necessarily a bad soldier, they just make others feel like they aren’t intelligent enough to do their job. These are the know-it-alls who always confess to knowing long-lost knowledge about various this-thats-and-the-others. They are mostly just annoying.\nThe Whiner: This soldier will do their job but they will complain about it every inch of the way and will always have an excuse as to why they can’t hack it. It’s never their fault.\nThe Reg-warrior: This soldier knows their sh*t. They know every army regulation there is and they aren’t afraid to let everyone else know it. They are the ones who insist on making sure, that despite being outside and in the mud all day, that your dirty uniform is against Army uniform regulation 670–1 and that you are out-of-uniform.\nThe Ass Kisser: This one is pretty obvious. These are the soldiers that buddy up and kiss ass to anyone with the authority to promote them or make their job easier.\nStinky: This soldier never bathes or washes his uniforms. He smells. Bad. No one wants to be in a fox hole, truck, or tent with him. They would rather avoid him.\nGomer: This is the intellectually challenged soldier who needs his hand held for everything. He cannot accomplish even the most mundane tasks by himself and almost always requires someone to chaperone him.\nChairborne Rangers, or POGS: This soldier never leaves the comfort of the office. They are either privates/ specialists that are assigned to the office for administrative assistance, or high-ranking NCOs that handle the paperwork and various other administrative tasks. The NCOs are usually pretty good and are there to help. They are not considered POGS. It’s the privates who think they are awesome because they don’t get dirty or have to leave the office and then act like they are bad-asses after formation.\nThe Rebel: This soldier doesn’t care for authority. He let’s you know every step of the way that he does what he wants, how he wants, when he wants, and shy of smoking him every 5 minutes which takes away from you job, he is basically not really there and just makes everyone’s life hell.\nThe High-Speed: This soldier is motivated. Too much so. He is the one screaming “hooah!” and totally all about the current mission at hand and has had way too much coffee for the day. No one wants to be around the guy that is running around the kitchen acting like he is kicking doors down in Fallujah. Just simmer down there bud, it’s a slow day.\nUltimately soldiers tend to get along and the nature of the military typically weeds out those that aren’t with the program. Just do your job and remember that you a part of a team and that you have a place and a role to fulfil.\nMake friends, have fun when you can, work hard, and you will be a good fit.",

If he wasn't an NCO the revenge would have been swifter and communal.\nThomas West's answer to What were the weird things you did when extremely bored while serving in the military?\nIn the enlisted ranks you fight together and you die together, there is no room for a lack of trust. That doesn't mean covering for someone's criminal behavior, but if you see a can of Dip in their AIT locker keep your mouth shut, as it's no concern of yours.\nI really want to tell the story of what happened to a BF in my AIT, but it's likely far too graphic to risk an epic BNBR.",

      "31": "Retards who malinger to get disability benefits? Dumbasses who throw around titles/associations to make themselves look better/more connected than they actually are?\nIn my experience, I saw quite a few morons I met who tried to use that association as a “panty-dropper” line. Some had absolutely zero involvement but lied about it completely. Others had some tangential role, but played up other aspects. They’d slip up in really obvious ways, but blatantly deny it. Like:\n-Claiming to be stationed in Thailand for 1 month but not know the currency exchange rate (K Eschleman)\n- Assembling fighter jet parts as a aviation mechanic but not being able to provide accurate estimates of someone’s height (RRiffle - not a man, but part of the lying demographic)\n-Getting ‘disabled vet’ financial support when the ‘war wounds’ were just a conveniently faked injury at an on-base gym (S.C. Deming)\nDuring my time in the PhD Psych program at Wright State, I worked as a research assistant on a WPAFB base where my coworkers were enlisted, officer, & civilian. I’m pretty sure my experience was an terrible outlier b/c what I observed/encountered was complete shit.\nMy initial interest was based on performing truly advanced research at a higher officer-like level—one that I was already qualified for. I thought the funding would be solid and I would be working with intelligent, respectable professionals. (But even the officers I met then weren’t too bright). Instead, I was tossed into lower-level ‘enlisted’ shite by slimy advisors who were too apathetic to state that they actually had nothing to do with my interests. Like all a-hole advisors/employers, they had no problem with lying so they could waste my efforts.\nApparently there were many resources & training that I was supposed to have access to, but was denied access to/not informed of (like paid training, discounted on-base prices, discounted housing, etc.). The idea of “cutting edge military research” was just a marketing gimmick used to get ppl to sign up for projects that were going nowhere. ‘Pace is glacial & dumber than a bunch of rocks’ was a term I heard/saw in action frequently. It wasn’t “delta force”—it was “delta massive f*ckup.”\nMany of the males I met on site had a ‘alpha male complex’ despite being vastly unqualified (i.e. ugly, unathletic, dumb, unfaithful). Many of the males used their association with various mil sectors to get laid/make themselves look better. Based on the ppl I met, the “Uniform” appeal turned out to be joke—these ppl were lazy & stupid liars, definitely nothing like the higher quality “dedicated, diligent, ethical person” stereotype that I was guilty of believing (the kind that’s perpetuated in the media).\nI ended my work assignment & left the base in disgust after dealing with harassment from my supervisor (creepy cross-eyed James Christensen). To add to it, I was stalked by failed abortions (ex. Gene Alarcon - WPAFB/WSU, Scott Cambron Deming - OSU/US Navy). After that incident, I reported it to the local police and found out that this guy also had a criminal record from another state (FL). A pack of malingering dumb sh*ts who try to use the idea of “military service” to get laid & appear like ‘alphas.’ Pathetic.\nThese retards deserve a 1-finger salute.",

They owe it to their troops, the military and indeed the very politicians they serve, fierce, honest and forthright advice on military matters.

That kind of bird is universally hated. It is an initialism for “buddy fscker”, i.e. someone who gets his buddies into trouble for his own benefit. Typical blue falcons are rats, thieves, snitches and incompetent soldiers who attempt to cover their own incompetence by pushing the responsibility of their own screw-ups on someone else.The bully. Unfortunately, these guys tend to settle as noncoms. They are universally hated. I did a nasty shenanigan to one of my drill corporals just before the boot camp ended. I was told to polish his parade shoes, and so I did. I squeezed then a liberal amount of shoe polish inside his other shoes so that when he’d put those shoes on, his feet would get smeared with the shoe polish. It was too late to punish me anymore, and there would be no evidence it had been me who had done that shenanigan.The whiner. The one who complains all the time and whines and attempts to avoid service. Not only do they prove they are the weakest link of the chain, but their behaviour may get the other soldiers in trouble (in which case you have #1).The lazybum. The one who shuns and intentionally avoids the service, the hardships and the tasks, and pushes them on behalf of the others. See #1.The overtly intellectual. Yes, I was in trouble myself. The reason is that overtly intellectual soldiers (Stanine 9) tend not to blend in, they are easy to spot and they tend to question everything. While they will make excellent offficers and specialists, they are also potential troublemakers. I later got to know the Finnish military puts every recruit with Stanine 9 on special surveillance, to sieve out potential troublemakers, because a disgruntled intellectual can cause a lot of damage by sabotage. It gets better in the specialist training, though.The hygienically challenged. Keeping your personal hygiene is a must. Not only it is the most trivial form of being polite to your buddies, but bad hygiene on field will lead into diseases and other troubles.

I had later a hair-trigger temper boy in the platoon I commanded, and he was a real troublemaker.

They not only get the unit under suspicion, but can endanger the performance of the whole unit and cause unnecessary problems. Fortunately there is always the option of dishonourable discharge and getting drummed out.The rebel without a cause. Yes, conscription is basically slavery, and it is one of the greatest tragedies of the humankind. Yet negative attitude on everything and ‘in your face’ or ‘I don’t care a 5hit’ mindset is not only going to get you in troubles, but also the other servicepersons.

      "2": "The flight time for a nuke from Russia to the USA is about 30 minutes.\nThe US nukes will be launched before the Russian nukes are disabled. They will be launched while the Russian are still in space, unreachable.\nThat’s why the only winning move is not to play.",
      "3": "Yup.\nThe problem here is that the US will launch within just a few seconds after Russia launches (assuming they do). Which in turn means that we've launched before we can disable any of Russia's nukes.\nRussia launches\nWe launch.\nWe try to disable theirs.\nThey try to disable ours.\nIf the US gets lucky enough to disable all of Russia's nukes, ours are still in the air.\nAnd they'll land too.\nI suppose the US might have an ‘abort and self-destruct without setting off the nuke’ button installed, but they certainly don't run around telling me about it.\nAnd that button would have to work properly too. Or booms happen.\nBottom line: If you don't want to be nuked, don't launch. Else all bets are off.\nThat goes for us too.",
      "4": "Probably. A long-range nuclear missile arrives at its target so fast now that the leaders of the targeted country aren’t going to wait very long to respond. So the counterstrike might possibly go off as soon as enemy missiles are launched—if they’re detected—or at latest, as soon as the defending military’s computers determine where where they’re headed. I’m using the plural, missiles, because it makes no sense to launch just one. Why risk your own total destruction to take out one target? If you’re going to start a nuclear war, you go all out. I suppose a single missile could fly due to some accident or a commander’s insanity (See “Dr. Strangelove”), but even if it was a dud, that would feel like hostile intent to the recipient, who might not be willing to take a generous view of the situation.",

    "title": "Why do single men visit Pattaya Thailand",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Pattaya is famous for its nightlife and I have heard that it is better than that of Bangkok from the locals. Moreover, it is comparatively cheaper to stay in Pattaya than in Bangkok. For example, I am staying in a 4-star hotel overlooking the sea and this place cost 1,400 Baht or roughly 3,500 INR per night. Hostels come as cheap as 1,000 INR per night.\nAlcohol is cheap here. I went to a 7-Eleven shop, which is the like a one-stop solution for all your needs and the beer prices looked quite cheap. However, I don't drink alcohol and therefore cannot vouch for the taste or quality of these but these shelves are the most visited portion of the store. So I think they are in demand.\nFood is not very expensive either. If you are on a very tight budget, you can microwave meals at 7-Eleven for as low as 100–150 bahts. Otherwise, local street food stalls serve delicious meal options as well and as long as you are avoiding Indian food, you won't burn a hole in your pocket.\nNow coming to the main point as to why Pattaya attracts so many single men, making it the world's 14th most visited city by tourists - it is Pattaya’s nightlife. Getting a girl for a night is very easy; a loser or a nerd can also get action if he is willing to spend money. If you go to Walking Street, freelancer girls (that's what they are called) would approach you and you can take anyone you want.\nMost hotels in Pattaya are guest friendly as well. They will allow you to take a girl to your room for the night without charging anything extra. Plus there are pubs, dance bars, massage parlours and a lot of single men are attracted by all these.",
      "2": "Well come on… Why do you think? ha ha … I have been a frequent visitor, and for sure the girlie bars (and the girls within) have been a principal attraction. But that pales pretty quickly. The remorseless come on and hustle for drinks and your money gets wearying, to the point where I’m happy to leave and return to Bangkok - which I much prefer.\nI have friends in Pattaya too. Retired expats, Brits mostly. They are the other reason to visit. It’s on the coast too and unlike Bangkok gets those refreshing sea breezes which keep the temperatures down. Nothing like having ‘sun downers’ with mates (no girls) in the cool of the evening in a quiet little bar with a view of the sea.",

Admitting it shows that you're self-aware and willing to take responsibility.\nApologize Sincerely: Offer a genuine apology to anyone affected by your mistake. A sincere \"I'm sorry\" can go a long way in diffusing tension and showing your remorse.\nStay Calm: Even if you feel embarrassed or anxious, try to remain calm. Panicking or becoming defensive can escalate the situation.\nAddress the Impact: If your mistake has caused harm or inconvenience, express your concern and ask if there's anything you can do to make things right.\nLearn and Grow: Show that you're committed to learning from your mistake and improving. Mention how you plan to avoid similar situations in the future.\nUse Humor Wisely: In some cases, using humor can help ease tension and lighten the mood. However, be cautious not to make light of serious matters.\nRedirect the Conversation: If the mistake is causing discomfort, smoothly redirect the conversation to a more positive or neutral topic.\nOffer a Solution: If appropriate, offer a solution to rectify the mistake. This proactive approach demonstrates your willingness to make amends.\nMove On: Once you've acknowledged the mistake, apologized, and taken necessary steps, try to move forward and engage positively in the social situation.\nLearn from Experience: Use the situation as a learning opportunity. Reflect on what went wrong and how you can handle similar situations better in the future.\nRemember, everyone makes mistakes, and how you handle them can show your character and maturity. People generally appreciate those who can acknowledge their errors and take steps to make things right.\nThanks and Regards, Divyansh Dubey",

Apologies for that!\"\nThe Light-Hearted Blame Shift: \"My evil twin decided to join the conversation for a moment there.

      "6": "Fixing a mistake in a social situation can depend on the nature of the mistake and the dynamics of the situation. However, here are some general steps you can take to address and rectify a mistake:\nAcknowledge the Mistake: If you realize you've made a mistake, it's important to acknowledge it rather than ignoring it. Pretending the mistake didn't happen can sometimes make the situation more awkward.\nStay Calm: Take a deep breath and remain calm. Panic or getting flustered can make the situation more uncomfortable for everyone involved.\nApologize: If your mistake impacted someone else or caused inconvenience, offer a sincere apology. Be straightforward and genuine in expressing your regret.\nTake Responsibility: Accept responsibility for your mistake. Avoid making excuses or blaming others.\nOffer a Solution: Depending on the nature of the mistake, offer a solution if possible. This shows that you're committed to making things right.\nLearn from the Mistake: Use the mistake as a learning opportunity. Understand what went wrong and how you can avoid making a similar mistake in the future.\nUse Humor (if appropriate): In some situations, using light humor can help diffuse tension. However, be cautious not to make jokes that might make the situation worse.\nMove On: Once you've acknowledged the mistake and taken steps to address it, try to move on. Dwelling on the mistake excessively can prolong the discomfort.\nGive Space (if needed): If the mistake was more serious or sensitive, give the other person or people involved space if they need it.\nMaintain Perspective: Remember that mistakes are a natural part of life. Most people understand that mistakes happen, and they're often more forgiving than you might think.\nIt's important to tailor your approach to the specific situation and the people involved. Genuine communication, empathy, and a willingness to make things right can go a long way in resolving social mishaps.",
      "7": "Open Communication and Honesty\nFixing a social faux pas is often an incredibly awkward and uncomfortable experience and it can be a delicate operation, but it doesn't have to be.\nI've learned from previous experience that by addressing an issue head-on, and being able to acknowledge your role and your culpability pertaining to the issue at hand is the most important criteria to successfully move forward.\nApologize, do it sincerely, and succinctly. Offer a genuine heartfelt apology to anyone who may have been affected by your wrongdoing. Be specific about what you did or said wrong, express regret, and show remorse for any harm or offense caused. This, above all will show your willingness to make amends. Furthermore, it shows that you respect the feelings of the others involved and demonstrates your willingness to atone for your actions.\nShow empathy by allowing the affected individuals to openly express their feelings and concerns pertaining to the mistake. Be an active listener and make an effort to understand things from their perspective. This will prove that you value their opinion, and are committed to repairing the situation.\nDepending on the nature of the mistake, consider taking every reasonable and appropriate measure necessary to rectify the problem. In some cases, it may involve offering assistance, providing compensation, or learning what you can do to change potentially offensive actions, beliefs, and/or behaviors to prevent similar social ills from happening in future interactions. Your willingness and ability to take these tangible steps will help to make things right and start to rebuild trust.\nI think of mistakes as opportunities. Reflecting on the gaffes, missteps and social indescretions you have made in the past allows you to identify what could been done differently. It helps to foster personal growth and reduces the liklihood of making similar mistakes over again.\nUnderstanding exactly what went wrong and why will help you to avoid repeating negative interactions in the future. Proving a commitment to self-improvement can possibly help to mitigate the impact of your error, depending, of course on it's severity.\nKeep in mind that everyone is different and people process information at different rates. Understand that resolving an issue in a social situation may take time. Allow those involved time to process their emotions and remember to give them space if needed.\nThe approach to fixing a social mistake may vary depending on the specific situation and the individual people and personalities involved, but the key takeaways here are to approach the process honestly with integrity, humility, and sincerity. An insincere desire to make amends will always be felt and will ultimately have the opposite effect and destroy any shred of trust that remained.\n“Tell the truth, and tell it always, cost you what it will. For, those who hide the wrong they do, do the wrong thing still.” - Betty Taylor",
      "8": "The easiest way to fix a mistake in a social situation is to simply acknowledge it, apologize, and move on. Here are some tips:\nBe honest and direct. Don't try to make excuses or minimize your mistake.\nBe sincere. Apologize genuinely, without sounding sarcastic or dismissive.\nMake it up (if possible). If you can, offer to do something to make amends for your mistake. For example, if you accidentally spilled someone's drink, you could offer to buy them a new one.\nDon't dwell on it. Once you've apologized, move on and try to enjoy the rest of the social situation.\nHere are some examples of how to fix common social mistakes:\nIf you say something offensive: \"I'm so sorry for what I said just now. That was completely insensitive of me.\"\nIf you forget someone's name: \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot your name. Could you please remind me?\"\nIf you arrive late: \"I'm so sorry for being late. Traffic was terrible.\"\nIf you bump into someone: \"Excuse me. I didn't see you there.\"\nIf you make a mess: \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll clean that up right away.\"\nIt's also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes. If you make a mistake in a social situation, don't beat yourself up about it. Just apologize and move on. Most people will be understanding and forgiving.",

We say something insensitive, we forget someone’s name, we spill a drink on someone’s shirt. It happens.\nBut instead of trying to cover it up or make excuses, the best thing we can do is to admit our mistake and say we’re sorry. This shows that we care about the other person’s feelings and that we respect them.\nOf course, saying sorry doesn’t mean we’re off the hook. We still have to make amends and avoid repeating the mistake. But it’s a good first step to repair the damage and restore trust.\nSometimes saying I’m joking doesn’t mean I’m joking.\nI’ve learned that some people use humor as a mask for their hostility and insecurity. They say something rude or mean, and when they get called out, they claim they were just kidding. They weren’t.\nNow, if they immediately apologize and take it back, it can go better.\nBut if they keep doing it, it’s a sign that they don’t respect you or themselves. They’re trying to put you down or make themselves look better by making you look worse. That’s not funny.\nOne thing you can also do if it’s your partner, and god forbid this happens. If you lose your temper and snap at your spouse/gf/bf in front of people, the best thing you can do is apologize right then and there. Do it in front of people. It saves face for both of you — and spares you from a blowout when you get home.",

      "4": "The positive way:\nwe can stick a piece of tape to our lock so that we can ask some of neighbours to check the status. If it as intact then we are happy to know no one tried to alter. If something changed r altered r removed then we should be alertive.\nThe Negative way:\nIf it stuck by someone , then we should be aggressive and assertive. Any how the culprits will observe for few days and they need to come to ur home to check that. Before they catch us, we should try to catch them as we need to point our cctv or keep a secret cam pointing our lock.

      "5": "Finding a piece of transparent tape stuck on the lock of your front door can potentially be a bad sign. Here are a few reasons why it could be concerning:\nPotential tampering: The presence of tape on your lock suggests that someone may have attempted to gain unauthorized access to your home. Criminals sometimes use transparent tape to determine if a lock is regularly used or to mark it for later entry.\nLock picking: Transparent tape can be used as a tool for lock picking. By placing tape on the lock, an intruder may be trying to gather information about the lock's mechanism or create a template for future attempts.\nVulnerability: If you discover tape on your lock, it implies that your lock could be compromised. It could indicate that the lock is faulty, damaged, or easy to bypass, making your home more susceptible to break-ins.\nSurveillance: In some cases, transparent tape might be used as a means of surveillance. It could be placed to capture fingerprints or as a makeshift sensor to detect when the lock is being operated.\nRegardless of the exact reason, finding transparent tape on your front door lock should be taken seriously as it suggests a potential security breach. It is advisable to investigate further, consider replacing the lock, and consult with local authorities if necessary to ensure your safety and security.",
      "6": "I found only two reasons for this occurrence. The first was it was to see if the houses that were occupied. Or to see the hours when people come and go. For burglary purposes. But so many people have garage entrances there is doubt.\nThe second was for Jehovah Witness’. To let other members know the houses that have been hit or no one is home.\nNeither made sense to me.",
      "7": "Its an internet myth that someone is checking if the house is occupied. Its unlikely this would happen in real life as there would be no need to cover the lock and alert the property owner, a small bit hidden away at the edge of the door frame would do the same trick and you’d never see it. If you do find some its more likely to be someone else who read about it on the internet trying to wind you up / annoy you.",

      "5": "Wow. I have been trying to get my cat OFF of dry food for quite a while. He's even had all of his teeth pulled and still enjoys his kibble over wet food! Dry food is not very good for cats. It can cause kidney issues and obesity. Look it up for yourself. You can feed a little bit of dry food but try hard to make wet food their main source. What is quite annoying is that I finally started to get my one cat to start eating some wet food with his kibble. I slowly introduced more wet and gave less dry. He started eating the wet food just as much as the dry. However, he then came down with an as yet undiagnosed gastrointestinal disorder and now has to be given special prescription diet food. The wet food is like meat gelatin. It's awful. And it costs $95 for just 24 cans. The bag of kibble costs just under that. Luckily, I have been able to doctor it up enough that he eats it with no problem, but now he tries desperately to steal his brother's regular wet food! It is funny; the cat that once hated wet food would now probably give his left paw just to be able to eat regular, tasty wet food…\nI apologize for the extra story in there, but this struggle has been real for me. My cat Is obese, and we just discovered that he has kidney disease in one kidney. Please don't force dry food on your kitty. Wet food may cost a bit more, but at least it's not a prescription diet! And IF you end up feeding dry food, you need to invest in better, more expensive brands. Ask your vet what they recommend. Please don't feed the cheap kibble. It is like junk food for them.",
      "6": "Your cat is smart! Wet foods are better for hydration. Lack of hydration can lead to uti’s and crystals and stones forming. Urinary obstruction is expensive to treat. So, your cat is saving you dollars in the long run. Be smart like your cat.",

I know, I have had 15 cats over the past 60 years.\nI feed my cats both. You could get your cat interested in kibble by placing some of it on top of the wet food, but there are so many different manufacturers of kibble, some my cats have liked and some they have turned up their noses at, so I have tried sample packets often.\nI currently have one cat, Sugar, a Maine coon cat, and she loves kibble and is not that fond of wet food.

      "11": "Transitioning your cat to dry food can be gradual. Mix a small amount of dry food with their wet food and gradually increase the ratio over time. Ensure fresh water is always available. Choose high-quality dry food to entice them with flavors and textures that appeal to their taste.",
      "12": "You might go to your pet store and purchase the smallest bag of high quality dry catfood and try giving it to him one at a time (hand feed), as a treat to try getting him to like dry food. Then if, over time, he likes it, you can go from there. You might try some food toppers such as Temptations Creamy Purée with chicken (which comes in pouches), putting a little of this over the dry food, or human baby food in beef, chicken or Turkey flavors putting a bit of that over the dry kibble. Wet food is a little more expensive and less easy to use, but can be beneficial in cats prone to lower urinary tract disease ( especially males), constipation, and who are overweight. Dry food can be a very efficient way to try to provide calories in thin cats with food volume limitations and allows for the use of food puzzles and food toy dispensers. You could also try a little tuna fish juice ( canned in water) over the dry kibble. Good luck to you and your cat.",

      "20": "Some cats will eat kibble, some won’t. You can try various brands of dry food to see if there’s one your cat will eat, but if he simply doesn’t like kibble, there’s little you can do to change his mind short of withholding food to the point where he will eat it only because he’s starving, and that’s animal abuse.

Only use for lunch and supper snacks please.\nAs a Vet nurse I’ve seen painful horrible twisting of the intestine in cats only fed dried food. Some of those cats died.",
      "26": "Feeding a cat exclusively hard food isn’t great because it contains no moisture. Cats evolved to get their moisture from their prey (blood) and they aren’t prone to drinking water regularly because of that.\nI feed my cats canned food only, now. When I was younger I fed my cat hard food, because our family cat was always fed hard food. As I got older I read more about cats and switched to canned food. Now I feed my cat the more expensive wet food.\nI’d look at your budget and see if you can afford to feed your cat wet food. If you have only one cat I think you should try. From a full-sized can (5.5 oz.) of wet food that’s two meals a day, and that’s all a cat needs.\nI often sprinkle, say, some bits of cooked chicken if my husband and I cooked and ate chicken, on top of the cat’s food as a garnish. If your cat is hesitant about eating wet food, put a little of the dry food on top of the wet food or to the side of the wet food. Don’t feed the cat from a plastic bowl or plate. Cats can very easily develop acne on their chins from plastic because it irritates the skin.\nI use a small, ceramic plate (like a small, side plate/one big enough to puy a mug of coffee on) from my daily “china”. I place it on the floor, but if you have a way to elevate it to the cat’s head hight some cats prefer that. Put it out of the way of foot traffic. Cats like to eat in peace!\nDefinitely buy different brands of cat food and rotate them (brands AND flavors). Cats can easily get bored eating the same flavors or even brands of food. Also, check the ingredients (on the label). The cheaper brands list “chicken parts) and that means chicken beaks and feet, etc. Just meat is much better for them.\nI feed my cat the paté style canned food, but the other type is smallish pieces of meat in gravy. However, I think the paté is more filling.\nAgain, rotate to find out what your cat seems to prefer. If feedng paté, I slice the food across the middle with a fork, t...",

    "title": "Why do Western people use a knife and fork to eat foods",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Because it’s suitable to the kinds of dishes we eat.\nMany Western dishes come to the plate as large pieces of food: steaks and chops, whole or very coarsely cut vegetables like potatoes, carrots, or asparagus, sizable composite dishes like stuffed cabbage leaves, beef Wellington, or lasagna, and so on. Knives are necessary to cut these large items into bite-size pieces, and forks are a useful tool to hold the large piece in place while it’s being cut and then spear the smaller pieces to raise them to the mouth.",
      "2": "Using a mechanical digger doesn’t leave room for your guests.",
      "3": "Unlike in many Asian cultures, Western chefs don’t always cut food into bite sized pieces during food preparation.\nInstead of a bunch of bite sized pieces of beef or pork in, say, fried rice, we’ll cook an entire roast and then cut off big serving-sized slices for each plate. Or consider a steak. Those slices are too big to eat in one bite, so it must be cut up before eating.\nTherefore the “cutting up your food at the dining table while you eat” aspect of the meal then became a unique part of Western food culture that other cultures may not immediately understand.\nOf course, it’s more complicated than that. Dining forks, and their modern Western usage, are a relatively recent invention. For a long time Westerners cut up their meat with a knife and either ate the pieces with their hands, or transferred it to their mouths skewered on the end of the knife.\nWhen forks first began to be used at the dining table, they only steadied the meat for cutting — the knife was still used to bring the food to the mouth. They even had knives without points, but wide, flat tips — imagine a butter knife, but sharp — that they used the way we would use a fork today, to scoop up non-liquid foods.\n(A reproduction of an 18th Century knife and fork set, from Townsends. You can see the fork is not useful for scooping food. It was only used to hold down what you were cutting. The wide, unpointed knife was used to scoop food and bring it to your mouth.)\nBy the 19th Century, these ways of eating were seen as uncouth and somewhat barbaric. It became polite to eat in a cleaner, safer way, and that’s when using a fork as the main way to transfer food into your mouth became common.",
      "4": "It's how we’ve been doing it. Did you just notice?\nIt's effective for our style of meat and potatoes cuisine. How does that sound.",
      "5": "It's considered impolite to not cut up your meat into bite sized portions, and most westerners aren't taught early in life to use chopsticks, for example, for it to be of second nature.",
      "6": "We don’t like to have grease and un-cooked juices getting all over our hands and fingers, very messy.\nTo be fair, we do use a spoon when consuming soups, ice cream and for scooping avocado.",
      "7": "Knives are obvious; they are useful to cut up large pieces of food so that they're easier to eat. Table forks were a fashion that began in Italy in the 14th century and spread from there. Originally they were only used by the social elites, but people who could afford to imitated the elites because that's what people do. At earlier dates people mostly ate with their hands and most people still did for a long time after the posh folk adopted forks.",

      "13": "And a spoon. The right tool for the right job.\nIt’s hard to cut a steak with chopsticks. It’s hard to have soup with chopsticks. It’s hard to eat ice cream with chopsticks. It’s also hard to do any of those things with your fingers.",
      "14": "Different solution to a common problem. Far eastern cultures metals were at a premium and knives were considered weapons of war. Flat or rounded tips reduced stabbings. Common people could always find a chunk of bamboo for chopsticks, metal for forks & knives, not so much. Chopsticks are more sanitary and disposable and are effective for grabbing tidbits out of a hot wok. The cooking was often done at the table so the cooking fire could be used for warmth. Picking out tidbits also means no plates are needed - again saving costs for the desperately poor.\nIn the west, cooking utensils became a sign of wealth. Culminating in the Victorian era where place settings had dozens of marginally different utensils for each possible food item. Hence “pickle forks\" et al., ad nauseum. Silver was used for its natural antibacterial properties, and again, for its status. Ornate place settings were the order of the day with cut crystal, silver, and elaborate patterns in heavy abundance.",

      "2": "The helmets of the British Military during WWII certainly gave the wearer headaches…they were designed with a “raiser strap” to lift the helmet up to ease the pressure and relieve headaches…I exist because of that design feature!\nAt some point in the war, my grandfather was deriving a replacement radio to a front-line position when all he'll broke loose. The Germans spotted him and opened fire. He hit the deck.\nFortunately, he had a horrendous headache that day and had drawn the suspender-strap. A bullet should have blown his head off…instead it went straight through the helmet just above the brim, grazing across the top of his head…drawing blood, but completely missing his skull.\nWe did have the helmet, but unfortunately it was stolen from my gran when she was in care during her final years (along with a good number of other ‘heirloom items’). It would have been great to add a picture of it.",
      "3": "Update: Original question: Why did American soldiers in WWII rarely fasten their chin straps? They seem to have modified the question to the point of having little relevance.\nWhat we read over and over again is that American GI’s during World War II thought that a steel pot (M-1 helmet) with the chin strap fastened facilitated death by concussion from artillery. The fastened chin strap contained the concussion forces inside the helmet, increasing the likelihood of death. They certainly thought that; whether that is true, I don’t know. It drove General Patton crazy.\nDuring the Viet Nam era, our steel pots had an adjusting head band (I still have mine) and a neck adjusting band, which fit just under the round of the back of the head. The chin straps were buckled around the back of the helmet as they no longer had a function. Adjusted properly, the helmet fit like a glove and never came off. I ran through the jungle at full speed, dodging trees, etc., and the helmet felt like a part of my head.\nIn fact, all equipment became like this. Besides having new equipment, an FNG (a new guy) almost rattled with movement. Over time, one learns to adjust the equipment, including the helmet, to feel like part of one’s body and not catch on vegetation.",
      "4": "I asked my father about that when I was a young boy as he had served in the 335th Infantry Regiment of the 84th Division in Belgium and Northern Germany in 1944. He said they left the helmet unbuckled to avoid injury from the concussive force of close artillery explosions. I always kept my helmet loosely buckled in the marines because I wanted both hands free to handle my weapons and not holding my helmet when I ran like some little girl holding onto her hat. I never had any neck injuries from concussion with that secured ‘pot’ so it worked for me. I honestly don’t know the actual reason but I believed keeping my helmet secured offered me the best chance of avoiding a head injury from shrapnel. I hope that helps.",
      "5": "A veteran’s anecdote, obtained from my late father who served in 163rd Engineer (Combat) Battalion during WW2, provides a different explanation.\nMore than fifty years ago my father, who was remarkably open and candid about his wartime experiences, told me that the American troops did not fasten the chin strap because they believed that a fastened helmet provided an enemy soldier leverage to snap a soldier’s neck from behind in nighttime infiltration and hand-to-hand combat situations.\nDad contended that a German reaching over the helmet and grasping the forward brim could break an American’s neck with a quick up and rearward pull with one hand while the other hand (or knee if grappling on the ground or attacking a sleeping soldier) was braced against the American’s upper back near the base of the neck.\nI’ve no reason to doubt my father’s belief. Whether or not it was a valid concern I cannot say, being neither a veteran of hand-to-hand combat nor an anatomist.\nA buddy and my father (skinny guy on the right who moved during the exposure) clowning with a store manikin in a blasted German town close to the end of the war in Europe. Note that no one, including the German manikin, has their helmet secured.\nLess than a month after this picture was snapped, Dad would be among the troops liberating the Dachau Concentration Camp.\nI only have a couple of Dad’s photos actually taken “in theater.” The 163rd were strafed on several occasions. I know that they lost numerous trucks; and I remember Dad telling me that many of his photos and souvenirs were lost to at least one of the resultant fires.\nWARNING, Graphic description follows:\nDad never mentioned a decapitation concern related to the buckled helmet and explosive concussion. However, he did have a gruesome observation about the concussive effects of aerial bombs. More than once, while commenting on the horrors of war, he mentioned seeing bodies, including those of civilians, whose lungs had been extruded out through their mouths by blast’s concussive pressure.",
      "6": "M1 helmet - Wikipedia\nThe WW2 M1 helmet wasn't very comfortable at all, and even when strapped, when looking down it fell forward to block vision.\n“Many soldiers wore the webbing\nchinstraps unfastened or looped around the back of the helmet and clipped together. This practice arose for two reasons: First, because hand-to-hand combat was anticipated, and an enemy could be expected to attack from behind, reach over the helmet, grab its visor, and pull. If the chinstrap were worn, the head would be snapped back, causing the victim to lose balance, and leave the throat and stomach exposed to a knife thrust. Secondly, many men incorrectly believed that a nearby exploding bomb or artillery shell could cause the chinstrap to break their neck when the helmet was caught in its concussive force, although a replacement buckle, the T1 pressure-release buckle, was manufactured that allowed the chinstrap to release automatically should this occur. “\nNot every M1 helmet had the T1 pressure-release buckle, so some soldiers did see that happen, broken necks by concussion force because the helmet was strapped. That was the main reason why the T1 pressure-release buckle update for the M1 helmet was created!\nGreen soldiers live to become veterans by listening to the teaching of veterans. Somewhere in the line, soldiers heard or saw the problem caused by the original wrong chin strap buckle, and they just passed it down.\n“In place of the chinstrap, the nape strap inside the liner was counted on to provide sufficient contact to keep the helmet from easily falling off the wearer's head. “\nIf adjusted right, you could run with the chin strap open without the helmet falling off.",
      "7": "I believe a lot of US soldiers did not wear their helmets with chinstraps fastened because of a rumor that blast from an artillery round would break your neck if you kept your chinstrap fastened. However, if you were close enough for blast to have any sort of effect on your helmet, you were probably close enough for concussive shockwaves to rupture the air sacks in your lungs (alveoli) and lead to a very rapid death anyway. It is possible soldiers saw other men killed in such a fashion, but without other marks on their bodies, might have assumed their necks had been broken. At any rate, most combat photography of German soldiers in combat show the Germans with helmets firmly secured by their chin straps.",
      "8": "My understanding was a fear of concussion from the blast. Big shells send out a pressure wave. I am not sure if this is a valid fear or urban legend. I read an interview with a Navy guy who said they were to avoid being on deck when guns fired. He said the Iowa type 16 inch guns sent a pressure wave that felt like being hit with a mattress. He said the 2 inch guns firing felt like being hit with bats.",
      "9": "There were several problems with the M1 GI helmet in WWII. For one thing, they were hot. Made of two parts, a steel helmet (often called “a steel pot”) and a lighter-weight internal liner, much like today’s hard hat, only made of lower quality metal. (In WWI, helmets were nicknamed “tin pots,” as they were made of very thin steel; they were also called “soup bowls,” as when inverted, they resembled this particular piece of tableware.) The outer steel cover of the M1 was a heat conductor, and in warmer climates or weather, they often became too hot to handle with a bare hand.\nThe second problem was that they were heavy. Combined with the inner liner, they weighed more than 2 lbs. As the average GI stood only 5′8″ tall and weighed less than 160 lbs., this was a formidable weight to carry around on one’s head. Military police, drill instructors, hospital personnel and general officers seldom wore the outer cover unless they were in a forward position, but only wore the inner covers. (A notable exception to this was George Patton, who always wore the full inner liner and outer covers, and he had the outer shell chromed, as well.)\nA third problem was that the helmets, unless covered with a fabric netting, which was not provided but had to be hand-fashioned until late in the war, were shiny. Reflections of sunlight, moonlight, or even flashes of tracer rounds or explosives provided enemy marksmen with ready targets. GIs found that camouflage and cargo netting worked well, as did leaves and grass from the surrounding geography, if some form of belt or elastic could be located to hold it on.\nThere was also the design of the inner liners. Although technically adjustable to fit “any size,” they were, in fact, very hard to adjust. In colder weather, GIs often wore fatigue caps or stocking caps underneath the liners, as well, which require readjustment of these stubbornly tight straps. The straps sometimes would shrink if they got wet, either from weather or sweat, and required readjustment, again. And, although designed not to so, they often stretched and became loose, and this led to another problem.\nThis was the lack of a balanced fit. When the inner liner was out of adjustment for any reason, the helmet itself wobbled and moved on the head unless it was secured by a chin strap. But the chin strap was the point of your question.\nFor a variety of reasons, some genuine, some apocryphal, the chin straps were not popular, and GIs hated wearing them tight and secure. The reasons varied from fear of their being a disadvantageous and dangerous hand hold for an adversary in the case of close or hand-to-hand combat to a belief that the concussive force of an explosion of artillery shell or bomb could wrench a man’s head back so violently as to break his neck. This was unlikely, although there were many reports of it happening. Military regulations, though, required that the chin strap be secure and tight and that it actually fit over the wearer’s chin, not under it. This was loosely enforced, except, again, by Patton, who would fine a GI and dress him down or even levy a fine or other punishment if he caught him with an improperly worn chin strap. Some other top officers also enforced this rule, even when behind the lines or in a rear area.\nThe M1 helmet was designed to prevent injury from shrapnel or flying debris, not bullets. They were far from bullet proof against German or Japanese rifles, and certainly not against heavy machine guns. It also was to protect against concussion. Many GIs falsely believed that it was a shield against gunfire, to their detriment. Many preferred not to wear their helmet unless they had to, and in the event of a surprise artillery attack or bombing, they sometimes paid the price.\nThe M1 was in service from the commencement of World War II until 1985. It was improved, most notably in the areas of a better inner liner with elastic straps and easier buckles to manipulate, a break-away chin strap in the event that a man needed to discard his helmet for any reason and to prevent the above-mentioned broken neck possibility. Lighter and stronger metals were used for both the outer shell and inner liner, and especially made camouflage netting, canvas covers, and duller, non-reflective paint was developed. Little could be done about the discomfort of wearing them, though, and throughout the period GIs serving in war, wet climates complained mightily about their helmets, and, when they could, they refused to strap them down to their chins.",
      "10": "The Army has protocols for when helmets will be worn and not worn. In general, in combat helmets are worn without the chin straps tightened down because people have been known to have their necks broken when explosions go off near somebody wearing a helmet with tightened down chin straps. When a small unit goes on a patrol, they are allowed to wear caps instead of helmets because of the noise factor helmets can make when they hit walls, trees or fall off of a guy’s head.\nWhen paratroopers jump from airplanes they are required to wear helmets with chin straps tightened down because their helmets help keep them from getting concussions when they hit the ground. Once you have been in an infantry unit for awhile, you pretty much get to choose when you want to wear a helmet or not when you move outside of your perimeter. Some guys believe in them and others prefer not to wear them because of the weight. When you wear one of those heavy things for a long time, you can get “a helmet headache.”\nHelmets have their pluses and minuses like everything else has going for them. Most military people use common sense when it comes to wearing helmets. I had one guy swear that after the first time that he was in a gunfight he tried to completely crawl under his helmet for safety. Naturally, I think that he was overstating his case of trust or love for his helmet.",

His work include Tombstone (墓碑), a comprehensive account of the Great Chinese Famine during the Great Leap Forward , and The World Turned Upside Down (天地翻覆), a history of the Cultural Revolution . Yang joined the Communist Party in 1964 and graduated from Tsinghua University in 1966. He promptly joined Xinhua News Agency , where he worked until his retirement in 2001. His loyalty to the party was destroyed by the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre . [3] Although he continued working for the Xinhua News Agency , he spent much of his time researching for Tombstone . As of 2008, he was the deputy editor of the journal Yanhuang Chunqiu in Beijing. [1] [4] Yang is also listed as a Fellow of China Media Project, a department under Hong Kong University . [4] Tombstone: The Great Famine [ edit ] Beginning in the early 1990s, Yang began interviewing people and collecting records of the Great Chinese Famine of 1959–1961, in which his own foster father had died, eventually accumulating ten million words of records. He published a two-volume 1,208-page account of the period, in which he aimed to produce an account that is authoritative and can stand up to the challenge of official denial by the Chinese government . He begins the book, \"I call this book Tombstone . It is a tombstone for my [foster] father who died of hunger in 1959, for the 36 million Chinese who also died of hunger, for the system that caused their death, and perhaps for myself for writing this book.\" [1] The book was published in Hong Kong and is banned in mainland China. [5] [6] In 2012 translations into French, German, and English [7] (which has been condensed almost by 50%) [8] have been published. [9] [10] He was reported to be banned from leaving China to receive the award in a ceremony in Harvard University to be held in March 2016. [11] Reception [ edit ] Journalist Anne Applebaum praised the book as being the definitive account of the Great Famine. [1] [5] Yang was awarded The Stieg Larsson prize 2015 for his 'stubborn and courageous work in mapping and describing the consequences' of The Great Leap Forward. [12] Yang was awarded the 2016 Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism , selected by the Nieman Fellows at Harvard University . In the award citation, the fellows stated: \"Through the determination and commitment required for this project, Mr. Yang clearly demonstrates the qualities of conscience and integrity. He provides inspiration to all who seek to document the truth in the face of influences, forces and regimes that may push against such transparency.\" [13] Sun Jingxian, a Chinese mathematician, saw in the book a direct attack of China's political system asserting that Yang had done that by committing a distorted historical investigation.

[ citation needed ] He worked closely with Mao Zedong , Zhu De , Zhou Enlai , and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Chinese Communist Revolution , and was with these central Communist leaders at Yan'an . [ citation needed ] Later, he was imprisoned in solitary confinement , twice. [1] In his book \"The Man Who Stayed Behind\", Rittenberg stated that he was the second American citizen to join the CCP, the first being the Lebanese-American Doctor Ma Haide (born Shafick George Hatem.) Early life [ edit ] Rittenberg was born into a Jewish family in Charleston, South Carolina and he lived there until his college studies. [2] [3] He was the son of Muriel (Sluth) and Sidney Rittenberg, [ citation needed ] who was president of the Charleston City Council. After attending Porter Military Academy , he turned down a full scholarship to Princeton University and instead attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , where he majored in philosophy . [ citation needed ] While attending Chapel Hill , he became a member of the Dialectic Society and the US Communist Party . [4] When he arrived in China, he was sent to bring a $26 check to the family of a girl who was killed by a drunken US soldier. [ citation needed ] Despite the family's devastation, they gave Rittenberg $6 for his help. [ citation needed ] It was at that point that \"something inside Sidney Rittenberg shifted.\" [5] Interpreting for Mao [ edit ] Rittenberg befriended the communist leader in the Yan'an caves, which resulted in a lasting relationship with Mao until early days of the Cultural Revolution. He later worked for the Xinhua News Agency and Central Broadcast Administration . [6] First imprisonment [ edit ] In 1949, immediately before the formal surrender of Beijing to the Communists, Rittenberg said he was summoned to the capital and he went, expecting to play a role in promoting the Communist takeover to the rest of the world. In fact Rittenberg was arrested and placed in solitary confinement, because Stalin had denounced him as a US spy. Rittenberg attributes his survival in solitary confinement to a poem by Edwin Markham : [7] They drew a circle that shut me out Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout But love and I had the wit to win; We drew a circle that took them in. Cultural Revolution [ edit ] On his release in 1955 Rittenberg remained a strong supporter of Mao and actively and enthusiastically supported the Great Leap Forward . Later he was a supporter of the Cultural Revolution and briefly associated with Mao's inner circle, leading a group of rebels to take over the state broadcasting institution.

We will post links to obituaries and appropriate comments here. Obituaries: New York Times Washington Post The Film Sidney Rittenberg (whose Chinese name is Li Dunbai) arrived in China as a GI Chinese language expert at the end of World War II. Discharged there, he joined the Chinese Communist Party, and was an active participant in the Chinese communist revolution and its aftermath. An intimate of the Party's leadership, including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, he gained prominence at the Broadcast Administration, one of the most important agencies of government. But in the convulsions of a giant country constantly reinventing itself, he twice ran afoul of the leadership, and served a total of 16 years in solitary confinement. He returned to the United States in 1980. Rittenberg captivates the audience with his exceptional intellect, uncompromising honesty, and engaging personality. Over a five-year period, award-winning former-CBS journalist and China specialist, Irv Drasnin, interviewed Rittenberg to produce a compelling, complex and unique understanding of the 20th century's biggest revolution. From Sid first meeting Mao in the caves of Yan’an, to his becoming famous and powerful during the Cultural Revolution, to his battling insanity in solitary, his journey and his profound insight illuminate a much greater history—a history few Chinese are aware of, let alone many Americans, told by an American who was there. Please view our 2-minute trailer below: If you're having trouble watching this video, you can watch it on YouTube by clicking here . The Revolutionary was completed in late 2011, and has been reviewed by a number of China scholars. Here are two responses: \"This is a splendid documentary. It brings out Sidney Rittenberg's incorrigible search for social justice and idealism as well as his remorseless ambition to make a difference and his relentless honesty about himself. He comes across as a complex, fallible, but admirable man. His relationship with his wife, Wang Yulin is touchingly portrayed. In a larger sense, Rittenberg's part in history (which was improbable but not at all small) and that history itself are brilliantly evoked. The ending, in which Rittenberg's very American pragmatism and his Chinese wife's commercial instincts triumph, is worthy of Voltaire's Candide. This is a painless but poignant way for Americans and other foreigners to begin to understand modern Chinese history. My wife and I loved the film.\" -Chas Freeman Jr., former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Nixon's principal interpreter in China \" The Revolutionary is the remarkable story of Sidney Rittenberg, as only he could tell it.

The tale has been translated into over 100 languages. [1] \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" was first published with \" The Little Mermaid \" in Copenhagen , Denmark, by C. A. Reitzel, on 7 April 1837, as the third and final installment of Andersen's Fairy Tales Told for Children . The tale has been adapted to various media, and the story's title, the phrase \"the Emperor has no clothes\", and variations thereof have been adopted for use in numerous other works and as idioms . Illustration by Hans Tegner Two swindlers arrive at the capital city of an emperor who spends lavishly on clothing at the expense of state matters. Posing as weavers, they offer to supply him with magnificent clothes that are invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent. The emperor hires them, and they set up looms and go to work. A succession of officials, and then the emperor himself, visit them to check their progress. Each sees that the looms are empty but pretends otherwise to avoid being thought a fool. Finally, the weavers report that the emperor's suit is finished. They mime dressing him and he sets off in a procession before the whole city. The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all. The people then realize that everyone has been fooled. Although startled, the emperor continues the procession, walking more proudly than ever. Sources [ edit ] Andersen's tale is based on a 1335 story from the Libro de los ejemplos (or El Conde Lucanor ), [2] a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales, by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348). Andersen did not know the Spanish original but read the tale in a German translation titled \"So ist der Lauf der Welt\" (\"That's the way of the world\"). [3] In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father; whereas Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity. [4] [5] There is also an Indian version of the story, which appears in the Līlāvatīsāra by Jinaratna (1283), a summary of a now-lost anthology of fables, the Nirvāṇalīlāvatī by Jineśvara (1052). The dishonest merchant Dhana from Hastināpura swindles the king of Śrāvastī by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of illegitimate birth.

Why ? if there are no heirs that want them that can legally own them; then you could end up missing out on a lot of money! Cha-Ching!!! get it ? You need to find out what exactly did he own. Such as older Colts, Winchester's, original firearms from the civil war can bring a quite a bit of money. Don't just trust anyone.

      "38": "I’m very sorry for your loss. I understand that you don’t want to keep his guns, and I’m here to help you with some options for disposing of them safely and legally. there are four main ways to dispose of unwanted firearms:\nSurrender them to your local police. This is the easiest and most secure option, as the police will take care of the legal and safety aspects of handling the guns. You can call your local police station’s non-emergency phone line and ask them how to proceed. They may send officers to your home to collect the guns, or ask you to bring them in at a scheduled time. You will not receive any compensation for this option, but you will be free of any liability for the guns.\nSell them or donate them to a licensed dealer or collector. This option may allow you to get some money or tax deduction for your unwanted guns, but it also requires more effort and research on your part. You will need to find a reputable and licensed dealer or collector who is interested in buying or accepting your guns, and follow the state and federal laws for transferring firearms. You will also need to make sure that the guns are in good working condition and have not been reported stolen or used in a crime.\nTake them to a gun buyback program. This option is similar to surrendering them to the police, but with the added benefit of getting some cash or gift cards in return. Gun buyback programs are usually organized by local governments, community groups, or churches, and they aim to reduce gun violence by taking unwanted guns off the streets. You can check online or in your local newspaper for any upcoming gun buyback events in your area, and bring your guns there with no questions asked.\nDeactivate them and turn them into art. This option is for those who want to keep their guns as a memento or a decoration, but without the risk of them being used or stolen. You can deactivate your guns by making them permanently inoperable, such as by welding the chamber closed or the barrel to the frame. This way, they are no longer considered firearms by law, and you can display them as you wish. However, you should be careful not to damage any historical or sentimental value of the guns, and consult a professional if you are not sure how to do it safely.\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision about what to do with your husband’s guns. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more assistance. I’m here for you.",

      "40": "Talk to the owner of your local gunshop… Get them assessed for current market value.\nThen you can agree on a price for an outright sale or you can allow him to sell them on consignment for a percentage of the sales price or find another shop or individuals to sell them to and know a fair price.",

I have been a responsible gun owner since 1960… Or take them to a gunshop and sell them, or put them up for auction, or give them to your grandson, or one of your husband’s friends.

I know that inheriting someone's firearms is a matter of true honor. They would need to be someone responsible. If no one wants them, you can sell them. There are brokers and pawn shops you can easily find that will take them off your hands.\nIf none if these are appealing, call your local sheriff's office and explain the matter. They will help you dispose of them.\nAgain my condolences. Do what you feel is right on your own time.",

      "50": "My condolences for your loss. You should prioritise safety when handling your late husband's firearms and observe all applicable laws. You can get advice on the right ways to transfer or dispose of the guns from your local law enforcement or a licenced firearms dealer. You may have the choice to give them to someone who is eligible under the law, give them to a licenced guns dealer, sell them to them, or give them to police enforcement for disposal. It is essential to store the firearms safely and unloaded until they are handled appropriately. You can get the best advice in this scenario by speaking with legal and law enforcement experts."

    "title": "If all soldiers everywhere had to wear pink uniforms would it reduce war",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Probably not. Back in the 17-19th centuries soldiers tended to wear flashy brightly colored uniforms.\nThat never prevented wars from happening. At the beginning of the First World War, French soldiers wore light blue uniforms with red trousers. This made them easy targets for the Germans and the major early losses were attributed to the visible uniforms.\nThey later adopted a less eye catching “blue horizon” uniform to minimize visibility as they were able to blend in with the environment a bit more.\nDuring the Second World War, generally every military had adopted a brown or camouflage green uniform that is accustomed today.",
      "2": "In what alternate universe do you foresee this happening? Would it reduce war? No. Wars are not fought because of the color of one’s uniforms. It would, however, make things more colorful.\n** Here we have some parading Thai soldiers in their pink uniforms. No photoshop here.\nFor the sake of argument, if everyone were to wear pink uniforms, it would make it damn hard to seek cover and concealment. It would also be hard to differentiate friend from foe. Maybe we could have different shades of pink.\n** For a very short time, an Army testing facility fielded pink uniforms in an attempt to see if they would distract the enemy in combat operations. It didn’t work so well. They suffered 70% simulated casualties.\n** No, this is not a colorized photo from WW...",
      "3": "Do you really think that the sort of people who would willingly place their own precious mortal bodies between their beloved homes and war’s desolation would be deterred from their duty by wearing a color you deem shameful?\nBesides, we’ve already seen that when the shit hits the fan, soldiers and Marines will fight wearing almost anything.\nFurther, I would ask…who is going to make them wear pink anyway? If their own governments aren’t issuing pink uniforms, what body is going to force compliance with such a maliciously stupid edict?\nOriginal question-If all soldiers everywhere had to wear pink uniforms would it reduce war?",
      "4": "No and I can’t believe this is a serious question.\nFor one, soldiers don’t start wars they just have to fight them.\nTwo, if you think someone will choose not to fight because of what they are wearing, well not only is the answer “no” but it’s completely ridiculous to even expect that to be a possible outcome.\nThree, not all wars are fought by professional soldiers. International law requires use of a uniform or in the case of irregular forces that they wear something to identify themselves and carry arms openly, yet what we get is insurgents that hide among civilians. Realistically you’ll never even get nations to agree to make their soldiers do something stupid like this but even if you did, it wouldn’t affect everyone that fights in war.\nFinally, if soldiers had to wear pink all the time, they would pretty quickly come to see it as normal and not something unmasculine. Not to mention that not all soldiers are male or would be expected to be bothered by masculinity issues. In fact, making pink part of all militaries everywhere is a good way to make society in general associate pink with strength and masculinity but that’s about it.\nPink does not stop soldiers from being soldiers.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "It’s clear what NATO membership could do for Ukraine but the question is what’s in it for NATO? Accepting another country, already in conflict with Russia, is an enormous risk. Even sympathetic analysts estimate, at its current pace, it would be ten years before Ukraine meets the criteria for membership. My best guess is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with NATO, train with NATO, bring its legislation in line with NATO and try to get as many benefits as it can without actual membership. Analysts also seem to agree that NATO would not even consider accepting Ukraine unless it made dramatic progress in preventing and responding to corruption - that includes defense procurement.",
      "2": "That would mean the end of civilization on Earth.\nThreats of Nuclear War from Russia or North Korea or both, with weapons of Mass Destruction is the last resort. Nobody wins in that scenario. Just massive annihilation of everyone on Earth.\nRemember what happened to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden ?\nMilitary assassination of those Evil Russian Dictators and Oligarchs is quite probable for the horrendous and disgraceful murdering of innocent Ukrainian Civilians and Children.\nWhat goes around, comes around.",
      "3": "If it become apparent that NATO is about to accept the Ukraine, then Russia will invade. It will be very quick. The rest of the world will be presented with a fait ( how’s my French?)accompli. The west will make a lot of noise, but do nothing.\nIf for some obscure reason the Russians allow the Ukraine to slip into NATO,…that means NATO troops in the Ukraine… then they will cry foul, make a lot of noise and invade Georgia(?)for their own ‘protection’.\nThe fact is, Putin wants all he can get and he’s not going to stop ‘till he has the old empire back. He’s seen the Western response to The Crimia. Past is prologue. He thinks he can get away with it.\nIt will take extraordinary Western leadership,…I don’t see that in current(Trump) white house…to get the Ukraine secure and into NATO before the Russian bear bites.\nRussia “needs”The Ukraine. The West “wants” The Ukraine it’s just a question of appetite and who moves first.\nA really good Kissinger kind of diplomacy could save the world a lot of anxiety. But, the west today, owing to the white house, is kind of rudderless,…which means unpredictable.\nAnd that IS dangerous. Nevertheless an actual war is unlikely",
      "4": "First off, the chances of a full-scale nuclear war are close to zero, regardless of the circumstances. All of the superpowers are a bit like teenage boys, puffing their chests and acting macho. But, none of the superpowers are complete idiots, not Russia, not the USA (though both come close)…\nSecondly, Ukraine, unfortunately, has little to no chance of ever joining NATO. The “western countries” have a history of leaving Eastern European countries to meet their fates alone. After the Second World War, they abandoned the Baltics to the Russians / Soviets. They most likely will abandon Ukraine.\nI wish Ukraine every success in their struggle against Russian imperialism, but, unfortunately, I see no chance of NATO helping them.",

Ukraine can be integrated into NATO without Russia having a say and being able to threaten to use its nuclear weapon as Putin is so fond of doing.\nRussia will even be paying for the reconstruction of Ukraine and will have to accept that Ukraine can fully express its sovereignty.\nRussia will not be worse off, because in the end, NATO is not a threat to Russia. NATO is simply a hedge against the expansionist madness of Putin and his eventual successors in Russia.\nWhat is happening in February 2022 is the ultimate proof of the usefulness of NATO to protect against Russia and the absolute necessity for all Eastern European countries to be part of it.\nIf NATO expands, Putin is solely responsible.

Which is precisely what would happen in this case.\nQuestions of this nature on Quora: Why can't the West accept the fact that a war with Russia is unavoidable and start a massive armament of the Ukrainian army and accept Ukraine to NATO? tell you all you need to know.",
      "11": "Putin’s attack on Ukraine has changed the equation of consequences if Ukraine joins NATO.\nNeed for a reload\nAfter many months bogged down in southern and eastern Ukraine, Russia has lost the capacity to wage an effective war with any country larger than Turkey. We need to re-arm. Ukraine has a window of opportunity for several years ahead, at least.\nAs we can remember from a few years back, Russia backed from direct military confrontation with what we considered hostile actions on the part of Turkey and Israel. That was before. Sevastopol has since lost its role as our primary naval base in the Black Sea, just as one example. We’re certainly not in a better shape now.\nWe still can start lobbing nukes in the Baltics and Poland. But before we regain strength in conventional forces, in terms of politics and the military, this will lose us more than gain.\nEasier partner\nThe recent spat about Ukrainian grain in Europe when the Ukrainians went about insulting the Poles, their prime allies in the war, has once again shown how immature and unpredictable the political class of Ukraine can be. Being tied by security guarantees to such a partner can lead to grave consequences.\nRemember how tiny Serbia unleashed an avalanche of hostilities that buried their mighty protector, the Russian Empire, in WW1? The guys in NATO certainly do.\nWhat is new here, is Ukraine getting very weakened now by the destruction of war and emigration. Its thieving oligarchs are impoverished. The political class is dominated by people whose power is dependent on continued help from the West. When the cannons fall silent and the reconstruction starts, the West will control the lifeline of the country’s economy and politics for a very long time. This will allow them to hold in reins the excesses of Ukrainian nationalism.\nMilitary integration\nThe daily interaction between the NATO military personnel and the Ukrainians has created a totally different level of interaction and trust across the border. The transparency this creates, along with the proliferation of fluency in English and familiarity within UAF with how things work in the West, create a whole new framework of cooperation. The Western politicians will meet much less resistance on the part of the guys in uniform and the bureaucrats in charge of the military back-office management who get to work on absorbing the UAF into the NATO structures.\nPlus the fact that the Ukrainians already have the NATO stuff on the battlefield and have gathered tons of experience as its end users. The hellish task of converting their entire war machine to NATO standards is already underway, and those in charge know the scope and the requirements of what needs to be done.\nSymbol value\nThe entire goal of the entire SMO on the part of President Putin was to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and the EU.

Do you really think that Putin and Co will nuke their children and multibillion estate? :)\nUkraine must join NATO to avoid tragedy of 2014–15 when the Russian bandits killed 10 000 people (most of them civilians), devastated two regions and annexed another one.

No country in the west is investing in this country and they have nothing to support themselves beside some agricultural production. Tourist are not coming because they are not feeling save, while visiting. [pickpockets, etc] Ukraine has a corruption invested industry . Foreign capital investment is also not secured and secure.\nIf Ukraine became NATO [== I doubt it with Trump as president ==], we will have a disaster in the making inside the Ukraine. Russia just shut off the oil and gas pipeline to this country and wait and see what will happened in the next episode.

All their Russian based knowledge industry [aeronautics, etc ] is not needed by the west and of course not anymore in Russia. Also these industries need energy from Russia. Their local energy production is not productive. Result: Steel industry is hampered and may become bankrupt. There is no energy industry or manufacturing industry, because of energy shortage. End result : EU will be receiving more refugees, but now from the impoverished Ukraine. Proof : since 2010 the population of Ukraine has decline by 8 millions——Where is the West now ?\nGermany will asked the EU to send food packages to Ukraine and worst of all may be will be asking the Ukraine, to receive the refugees from the middle east - a solution for the problems in the EU.",

      "23": "If Ukraine joins NATO and gets a nuclear arsenal, then Russia will be broken apart quite simply.\nI don't know all the factors that might cause this break, but they involve trade blockade, economic collapse, terrorism, information warfare, riots and coup. Or Russia would just let them install a western puppet government, but they would still break up Russia eventually for safety and control.\nIt's amazing how much pressure NATO has been able to put on Russia the last decade.\nRussia is trying to prevent Nuclear NATO Ukraine by any and all means. The stages of military conflict are roughly:\nNegotiations\nConventional war with Ukraine\nNuclear war with Ukraine (Terrible option, I know, but they can't hit back)\nIf Ukraine joined NATO (probably enough to break up Russia by itself), because of its positioning, it is still better to do:\n4. Conventional war with NATO Ukraine and other NATO countries (Hopeless and even more terrible)\n5.

      "30": "This is a “who would win in an US-Russia war without nukes” kind of question. The basic premise of Ukraine ever joining NATO is not possible at this point.\nAt least, as long as Donetsk and Luhansk are part of Ukraine. If they were cast off, then Ukraine joining NATO would actually become a possibility. Russia would then treat it like it does other eastern european NATO countries. With great care and with utter confidence in its ability to defend itself, while bolstering its buffer allies.",
      "31": "Nato wants Ukraine to be an anti russian mess. They don’t want to actually get that mess into NATO or the EU. But that’s a carrot to be used to get the ukraininans get on with Western anti russian policies until they get tired of the empty promises and the cost to the country. Occasional colour revolutions will help remotivate anti russian sentiment but won’t do much good for the development of the country. But that’s not a priority.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "Both lipid foods (fats) and protein have numerous benefits for the human body. However, the importance of each nutrient varies depending on individual needs and goals. Here are some key benefits of both:\nLipid foods:\n1. Energy source: Fats are a concentrated source of energy, providing more than twice the amount of energy per gram compared to carbohydrates or protein.\n2. Nutrient absorption: Certain vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are fat-soluble, meaning they require dietary fat for absorption and utilization by the body.\n3. Satiety and taste: Fats contribute to the feeling of fullness after a meal and can enhance the taste and texture of food.\n4. Insulation and protection: Fat deposits act as insulation, protecting vital organs and providing cushioning.\nProtein:\n1. Muscle development and repair: Proteins are the building blocks of muscles, and consuming adequate protein supports muscle growth and repair.\n2. Enzymes and hormones: Proteins are involved in the production of enzymes and hormones, which regulate various bodily functions.\n3. Immune function: Antibodies, which are essential for the immune system, are made of proteins.\n4. Satiation: Protein-rich foods tend to be more filling and can help control appetite and reduce cravings.\nUltimately, the benefits of lipid foods and protein are interconnected, and a well-balanced diet that includes both in appropriate proportions is important for overall health and wellbeing. The specific needs and preferences of an individual should be taken into account when determining the ideal balance of these nutrients.",

    "title": "Why did Kublai Khan meet with Marco Polo someone who was a nobody",
    "answers": {
      "1": "He might have been nobody in the West, but he was the only (or one of only a few) Westerners in the East.\nKublai khan, who ruled the East and the biggest Empire at the time, must have been interested in what was out there in the West.\nMarco, who was obviously great at telling stories, must have had been very interesting to the Emperor.",
      "2": "That’s a question which a number of historians have asked. Some have concluded that Polo never met the khan. We’ve only got Polo’s word for it, after all. He doesn’t appear in any Chinese records. Polo could be making the whole thing up.\nOf course, there could be a middle ground between “absolute non-person making things up” and “personal representative of the emperor.” The Polos were merchants. They were from a far off place, they followed a novel religion, and they represented trade. Kublai Khan was interested in all of that. So while Polo may not have had a position at court and acted as an agent of the emperor, it’s not implausible that he would have been presented to him at least once. After all, presidents and kings meet common people all the time. They don’t give them important positions, but they do see them from time to time.",
      "3": "Marco Polo was not a”nobody”. On the contrary, he was a Venetian merchant and explorer who gained considerable fame and recognition for his extensive travels to the East, particularly to China, during the 13th century.\nKublai Khan, the fifth Khagan (Great Khan) of the Mongol Empire, met with Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant and explorer, for several reasons:\n1. Exploration and Trade: Marco Polo's reputation as a skilled traveler and his knowledge of the Eastern world made him an interesting figure to Kublai Khan, who was known for his curiosity about different cultures and desire to expand trade routes. Kublai Khan hoped to gain insights into distant lands and establish profitable trade relationships.\n2. Intelligence and Diplomacy: The Mongol Empire was vast and diverse, encompassing various regions and peoples. Kublai Khan sought information about the territories under his rule, including China, which he conquered and where he established the Yuan Dynasty. Marco Polo's firsthand accounts and observations about the regions he had traveled to could provide valuable intelligence and aid in governing these lands effectively.\n3. Cultural Exchange: Kublai Khan was interested in learning about the customs, technologies, and societies of other regions. He wanted to foster cultural exchange and facilitate the flow of knowledge between East and West. Marco Polo's experiences and stories could offer a glimpse into European customs, technological advancements, and the political landscape of the time.\n4. Advisor and Emissary: Marco Polo's meeting with Kublai Khan went beyond a mere exchange of information. Marco Polo became a trusted advisor and emissary to the Khan, serving in various administrative and diplomatic capacities. He traveled extensively within the Mongol Empire and undertook several diplomatic missions on behalf of Kublai Khan.\nThe meeting between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo was mutually beneficial. Kublai Khan gained valuable knowledge, advice, and diplomatic support, while Marco Polo was able to explore distant lands, participate in important events, and document his experiences, which later became widely known through his book \"The Travels of Marco Polo.\"",
      "4": "The Emperor met Marco and his uncle because he had asked the uncle and his brother (Niccolò and Maffeo Polo), who were well known to him, to come back to China with certain people and information from the West. The Khan liked Marco who eventually rose high and from age 20 to 37 became an important emissary in SE Asia (as well as India) for the Emperor. If you read Marco’s book, you can trace the routes and towns he visited on behalf of the Emperor. His chronicle is extremely detailed and consistent, and confirmed by many other sources. He was sufficiently important and trusted to be chosen to accompany the Mongol princess Kokochin to Persia, on his way back to Venice. Lack of Yuan Chinese records of Marco in the archives means nothing. The Khan was not Chinese and the Chinese in any case never mention the contributions of foreigners at court. Even the Jesuits, who were highly influential for a century, are not mentioned.",
      "5": "Remember it is 13th Century. How many you think westerners could reach China at that time? He was nobody, of course. But, he was certainly a special person at that time. The Great Khan would like to hear about the cities and countries he and his groups had never seen. The possibility of new business, trading, it means money. Who will not be attracted?",
      "6": "Marco Polo, while not a prominent figure at the time, had several factors that likely contributed to his meeting with Kublai Khan:\n1. Exploration of New Territories: Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty and ruler of the Mongol Empire, had a keen interest in expanding his empire and gathering information about new territories. Marco Polo's travels to distant lands, including China, likely caught the attention of the Khan. Explorers and travelers were valuable sources of information about the world beyond the empire's borders.\n2. Reputation of the Polo Family: Although Marco Polo may not have been well-known individually, his family, the Polos, had established connections and a reputation as successful merchants and explorers. Marco Polo's father and uncle had previously traveled to Asia and had built relationships with Mongol rulers, including Kublai Khan. The family's background and credibility might have piqued the Khan's interest in meeting Marco Polo.\n3. Language and Cultural Exchange: Marco Polo was multilingual and had learned several languages during his travels, including Mongolian and Chinese. This linguistic ability made him a valuable intermediary for communication between Kublai Khan and foreign merchants or emissaries. His skills as a translator and cultural interpreter could have been a factor in his meeting with the Khan.\n4. Detailed Accounts of Travels: Marco Polo's extensive travels throughout Asia, particularly his time spent in China, provided him with a wealth of knowledge about the region. His detailed descriptions of the geography, culture, and riches of China intrigued Kublai Khan. The Khan likely saw value in hearing firsthand accounts from someone who had experienced and documented the wonders of the empire.\n5. Curiosity and Openness: Kublai Khan had a reputation for being open to engaging with people from different cultures and backgrounds. He was known for his interest in foreign customs, religions, and technologies. Meeting Marco Polo could have been a reflection of the Khan's curiosity and desire to learn more about the world beyond his empire's borders.\nIt is important to note that the exact circumstances surrounding the meeting between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are not extensively documented, and historical records can be subject to interpretation and discrepancies. However, these factors provide some insights into why Kublai Khan might have been interested in meeting with Marco Polo despite his relative anonymity at the time.",
      "7": "He wasn’t nobody - as his father and uncle were khan’s envoys to the pope - and they were sent back from the pope to khan taking Marco with themselves\nAlso they weren’t poor people but well-to-do-merchants\nBut first and foremost - the khan was probably curious of those exotic foreigners from Venice\nAlso we know very little about how many times Kublai saw Marco. It could be only once and it could be on regular basis dring his stay in China. - we don’t really know.\nAccording to Marco himself (or rather to Rusticello’s of Pisa record of what was told by Marco) - he held some important office in khan’s service\nWHich is not impossible. It was safer for Mongols to govern China through foreigners -as they were foreigners themselves.\nAlso an adventerous Venetian mechant had probably enough enterpreneuring spirit and vigour to execute khan’s will efficiently",
      "8": "There isn’t any Imperial records of Marco Polo. That is not to say he is outright lying, you have to remember that Yuan dynasty placed high emphasis of trading and there are a LOT of merchants passing through Dadu (present day Beijing) each day. The emperor sometimes held mass receptions to merchants and foreign delegates. Marco Polo may be present in one of those, but he is nobody important, so he did not warrant any attention from court historians.",
      "9": "Marco Polo started as a merchant in Venice. He traveled the Silk Road to China where he met the great ruler Kublai Khan. He was well-received by the royal court of Kublai Khan, who was impressed by his intelligence and humility. Marco was appointed foreign emissary and sent on diplomatic missions throughout the empire and Southeast Asia, such as present-day Burma, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. As part of this appointment, Marco also traveled extensively inside China, living in the lands for 17 years exploring and documenting much of Asia not yet explored by Europeans.\nMarco traveled much of China and the east, and his stories were written into popular books. His book would go on to inspire other explorers. Those exciting stories were a favorite of another famous explorer – Christopher Columbus.\nClearly, Marco Polo wasn’t a nobody!",
      "10": "While any account that says the author has done great deeds which are not witnessed by others is to be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe quite a few, it does not automatically mean it is a lie. A lot of weird things do happen. And other things are not as weird as they might look.\nKublai Khan was a foreign conqueror of a nation noted for its distaste of foreigners. So hiring other foreigners as minions ensured greater loyalty to the emperor. Of course, that doesn’t mean he was a high assistant instead of an assistant to an assistant of an assistant, but he did stay in China for some years and returned to Venice quite wealthy. The challenge that nobody else mentioned him really only rules out cabinet level positions. Khan ruled a massive empire that was largely illiterate. Even very powerful and famous people vanish under such conditions.\nOf course, if we do think of him as very powerful and successful, his return to Italy begins to look strange. Not at all unreasonable, but the less of a success he was in China, the more reasonable the idea is.",
      "11": "Thanks for the A2A.\nFirst of, Marco Polo is not a nobody. For someone who had travelled the lengths of some 6,000 km from Constantinople to Mongolia.. That is some explorer / survivor as this is by no means feat as in the olden days the roads were treacherous being laden with bandits and monsters (wildlife) and supply stations (villages) are few and far between.\nI understand Kublai Khan was an eager learner and the unchartered world would seemed a very interesting topic since he has sights on far west (Europe) at that point of time and anyone with information would be a great asset to feed his forever hungry Golden Horde.\nKublai Khan wants Marco Polo to be his eyes and that could very well added to the intelligence he had gathered from the west apart from his scouts and captured intelligence from the previous conquests by Genghis Khan. I would dare say that Marco Polo contributed very much to the conquests of Burma and China.",
      "12": "Mongols were always seeking people with outstanding knowledge to the extent, to even spare their life during the battle! They had scouts to point them out! Marco Polo must have been seen interesting to the Khan, since he could describe other lands and culture! That he was nobody, was immaterial..!",
      "13": "It’s far more likely that Polo met with a functionary of his court than with the man himself. Given the exaggerations and some outright falsehoods and outright impossibilities in some of this story, it’s certainly not a leap to think that this didn’t actually happen as he described it. If it did occur as described, it wasn’t apparently important enough for anyone on the Khan’s side of the fence to take note of. The mixture of fact, fiction and fantasy in Polo’s account makes it almost impossible to know for certain.",
      "14": "He might have been nobody in the West, but he was the only Westerners in the East. Kublai khan, who ruled the East & the biggest Empire at the time, should have been interested at what were out there in the West! Marco, who was obviously good at telling stories, should have had been very interesting to the Emperor!",
      "15": "Marco Polo was not a \"nobody\" at the time of his meeting with Kublai Khan. In fact, he came from a wealthy and well-respected family of Venetian merchants, and his father and uncle had already established business connections with the Mongol Empire.\nIn 1271, when Marco Polo was 17 years old, he embarked on a journey to China with his father and uncle, who were invited by Kublai Khan to serve as diplomats and trade envoys. Marco Polo accompanied them on this journey, which lasted over 3 years and took them through various parts of the Mongol Empire.\nDuring his time in China, Marco Polo impressed Kublai Khan with his intelligence, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. He became a trusted advisor and emissary of the Khan, and was entrusted with important missions and assignments.\nMarco Polo also wrote extensively about his travels and experiences in China, which became the basis for his book \"The Travels of Marco Polo.\" This book became immensely popular and influential, and helped to introduce Europe to the culture, customs, and geography of the East.\nIn conclusion, Kublai Khan met with Marco Polo because he recognized his value as a skilled and knowledgeable advisor, diplomat, and linguist. Marco Polo was not a nobody, but rather a well-respected and well-connected member of a prominent Venetian family, who proved himself to be a valuable asset to the Mongol Empire.",
      "16": "In ancient times, travellers from a foreign country were welcome in King's or in this case the Empror's court.\nThese travellers were very rare due to obvious reasons such as lack of transport.\nSuch travellers had their interesting chronicles for the Empror.\nMarco Polo was one such traveller. Similar to him there was Ibn e Batuta.\nSo in essence they weren't just a 'nobody' in those times.",
      "17": "Kublai Khan may have met with Marco Polo to instruct Marco to to accompany a Mongol woman who was being sent to Persia for the Ilkhan Arghun as a bride. This is mentioned on p. 168 of The Mongols by David Morgan. Much has been debated about Marco Polo’s claims about his time in China and the possibility of meeting Kublai Khan. Can anyone confirm or correct my very brief answer based on Morgan’s book?",
      "18": "If an alien from another planet landed on Earth and it turned out he was just an insurance adjuster from Planet X in the Andromeda Galaxy, you don’t think the President and government would still be interested in what he had to say?",
      "19": "I don’t think it takes too much to realize that Marco would have been at that time the only Italian person anybody in China had ever seen. So of course the empower would want to see him.",
      "20": "Seems the questioner doesn't know what was like to be in Mongol empire. Mongols classified people based on racial backgrounds and their ethnic backgrounds. White people and Central Asian Turkic were second class after the Mongols so Mongol Khan would have likely to see Westerners over other people. Beside, Polo was merchant from distant foreign lands. Kublai would never met a Chinese person as Chinese were the lowest caste under Mongol Yuan dynasty."

Which would make Putin look incredibly weak.\nBelow: picture of Putin at the CSTO meeting in Yerevan. Is this the face of someone who things are going well for?",
      "2": "Yeah, maybe, but is Armenia going to get wrapped around the axle about Ukraine taking back it’s own territory? How about the three “stans”, how are they going to punish Ukraine? And there is Belarus which is already up to their hubcaps in trouble with NATO. CSTO is a third rate attempt to belong to something resembling NATO. In fact, however, they are little more than a Boy Scout Troup with a few rifles.",
      "3": "No. Article 4 of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) establishes that an aggression against one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all.\nUkraine retaking Crimea would not be an offensive operation against Russia. Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Ukraine woukd be retaking it’s own territory back.\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev said that \"only in the case of a foreign intrusion and an attempt to externally seize power can we state that there is an attack against the CSTO\"\nHere there is no foreign intrusion into Russia. Only intrusion into Ukrainian territory.\nPlus many in the CSTO this past week have let Putin know of their disagreement with him and distanced themselves from him, figuratively and physically.",
      "4": "Russia might encourge it because they won't be capable of withstanding a concerted Ukrainian attack without a lot of assistance. However, considering Russia's Ukraine experience, it seems doubtful if any of the ‘Stans' would be interested in resisting Ukraine taking back territory to which they are legally entitled.\nWhen the time comes don't be surprised if Ukraine simple marches into Crimea without meeting the slightest resistance. The only possible stumbling block is Sevastopol, Russia's Black Sea naval base. Unlikely Ukraine will be willing to let that stand.",

In particular, we must rethink the linkages between three primordial principles: the sovereign equality of states, the territorial integrity of states, and peaceful coexistence between states.  \nThese three principles are \ninter-dependent. To respect one is to respect the other two. To undermine one is to undermine the other two.  \nAnd Belarus president Lukashenko is all talk and no action, playing the likeable fool to Putin.

Lukashenko has seen off mass protests and needs his troops to stay loyal and happy, sending them to Ukraine leave Lukashenko vulnerable.\nRussians fight to conquer teritorry, their friendly neighbours know that one day Russia might take a bite off them, just 10 years ago Ukraine thought Russia was their best ally, why send troops to die for Russia's twisted dream?",
      "6": "THE CSTO? Seriously?\nBwahahahahahah !\nWTF are they going to bring to Pukin's invasion?",
      "7": "Most of the CSTO states have already made it very clear they are not interested. The President of Kazakhstan (the largest CSTO member aside from Russia), in particular, has said that Kazakhstan believes in the territorial integrity of Ukraine and that Kazakh troops could not be deployed abroad without a UN resolution authorising so. The other central Asian states aren’t much more sympathetic.\nBelarus, on the other hand, is the one to watch. President Lukashenko has stated numerous times that Belarus will not invade Ukraine, but there is little reason to trust his word. He’s in a very tough spot. The Belarusians are overwhelmingly against both the war and his presidency, and he relies heavily on Putin to prop him up. Keeping Belarus out of the war (at least officially) is the only thing keeping him half-way ok with the Belarusian public right now. When it really comes down to it, Putin will likely twist Lukashenko’s arm hard enough to make him do what he wants him to do. If Lukashenko invades Ukraine, the Belarusians will revolt in large numbers as the unpopularity of the war and of Lukashenko himself become irreversibly combined. If he says no, Putin will deal with him in his own way and find a replacement that will be more obedient.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "It’s really hard to say, there’s a lot of dark shit\nHarry was horribly abused in a manner that, in real life, would lead to severe mental and emotional scars\nLove Potions are legal and unregulated in the Harry Potter universe, meaning.\nLove Potions are confirmed to lead to children who literally are incapable of feeling love, so you not only have an unregulated date rape potion, but the children of those unions are exclusively sociopaths.\nAlso like Love Potions, Polyjuice, even if Polyjuice is difficult to obtain it’s still available and unregulated, and could be used for all kinds of things\nGinny Weasley was possessed for a year, and there’s no indications that she ever got any kind of professional help for it\nThere are literal demons which suck the happiness, and souls, out of people and can’t be detected by 99.9% of the population. There is no known way to kill them, and only very very few individuals can repel them. They are sentient and they can breed. There is literally no reason why Dementors could not literally destroy the world.\nMuggle protection laws are very new and controversial. Wizards can shape shift, control minds and wipe memories. The implications of this in regards to sexual assault are disturbing.\nThere is a single wizarding school. Standards at that school are so low that they don’t teach subjects like math or science, it allows completely incompetent teachers like Trelawney and Binns to remain employed, it does nothing to curb it’s bullying and assault problems, or the fact it’s houses are practically a caste system, it’s had numerous teacher deaths, deadly creatures on the premises and allows teachers who are as abusive as Snape and Umbridge to continue teaching.\nThe Wizarding World is stagnated in the late Victorian era, it has no chance of effectively adapting to it’s inevitable discovery by Muggles in the 21st century.\nChild abuse appears to be normalized, accepted and common in the Wizarding world, just look at Neville Longbottom who is almost killed in an attempt to make him show magic, which in turn:\nLeads to the fact that the Wizarding World is an extremely bigoted society, bigotry towards Muggles, Squibs, Muggleborns, Magical Creatures, Hybrids and more are rampant, and while the books don’t focus at all on homosexuality or race, it’s not unreasonable to believe there’s likely discrimination based on those. Even the ‘good guys’ are bigoted, like Neville’s family’s hatred of squibs, Hermione’s treatment of her parents and Mr Weasley’s actions towards Muggles.\nThe Ministry of Magic is horrendously corrupt and useless, not only does this further confirm that the wizarding world is in trouble when it’s discovered, powerful devices and information that could be abused are kept in a ministry that can be broken into by schoolchildren.\nTime Turners exist, and are given out for such trivial reasons as taking extra classes, and if misused could lead to untold death, destruction and chaos. Not to mention there were no protections on the one Hermione used, anyone could have stolen it at any time.\nThere are next to no checks or balances in Wizarding Government, this includes Dumbledore who shows numerous examples of gross incompetence and negligence of his duties and charges, but nothing is ever done about any of it.\nLegilimancy has almost unlimited potential for abuse given that occlumency is a discipline that is rarely taught or even discussed. A legilimancer could easily have free range to steal the secrets of almost anyone, and mentally abuse and control vulnerable people.\nThe Wizarding World has literal truth serum, this could reduce crime almost 100%, yet crime is still a significant problem, and veritaserum is never shown to be used\nThe Wizarding World literally wipes the memories of Muggles as policy with no care for context. The side effects of this are assuredly worse than what’s portrayed on screen, this is at it’s worst in the World Cup scenes where a specific Muggle is repeatedly obliviated, then abused by Death Eaters, then obliviated again. We’ve seen that the obliviate spell can lead to literal brain damage, this poor guy effectively just got mind raped repeatedly, yet we’re meant to view it as a comic relief scene.\nAll in all, Harry Potter is fucked up, and I’m pretty sure that JK Rowling didn’t intend most of this to be half as fucked up as it is",
      "2": "MANDRAKES! and the fact that Professor Sprout raises these humanoids from infancy to adulthood, at which point she slaughters the sentient Mandrakes to create the Restorative Draught. Dark and MAJORLY ignored.\nAstute readers will note that Rowling intentionally humanizes the Mandrakes. This is less apparent in the movies.\nThe mandrakes have humanoid physiology, humanoid developmental patterns, humanoid conversations with Professor Sprout, and humanoid social growth patterns.\nAs humans are the only known species to have an extended puberty and develop acne thence, this is mildly horrifying:\nThe moment their acne clears up … it won’t be long until we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\nCoS Chapter 6:\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.\nNote the use of the male pronoun. Given that the series is GENERALLY told from Harry’s perspective, there’s only one way he was able to determine its sex … Think of the implications this has for the Mandrake’s reproductive habits. They also throw parties and move into their partner’s pot … This is no normal plant. Also note the baby human-like response to being uncomfortable.\nCoS Chapter 9:\nMandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but didn’t seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth[.]\nOnce again, they exhibit resistance, human-like emotions, and sentience.\nCoS Chapter 11:\n[It] was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\nThey are being raised like pigs for slaughter.\nCoS Chapter 13:\nMadam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. “The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for repotting again ... after that, it won’t be long until we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.”\nMoody and secretive?! Leaving childhood?! Acne?! Cutting them up and stewing them?! This is horrific. As mentioned before, humans are the only species to endure an extended puberty. This isn’t simple anthropomorphism, Rowling is intentionally humanizing the Mandrakes.\nCoS Chapter 14:\n[In] March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy. “The moment they start trying to move into each other’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told Harry. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.”\nWhile Professor Sprout was presumably “very happy” that she would be able to revive the petrified / potentially stop the Heir of Slytherin attacks, it’s extremely dark to imagine her watching, raising, and interacting with these teenagers / young adults and anticipating butchering them.\nSuspending disbelief, I’m fully aware that (1) these are plants and (2) people (myself included) eat meat and allow the slaughter of animals for survival. The question asks about dark elements in the series that are ignored—the nonchalant raising and slaughtering of humanoids is indeed dark and ignored.",
      "3": "The power of the Imperius Curse\n.\nThe Imperius Curse is one of the three Unforgivable Curses\n.\n(If anyone uses any of the three unforgivable curses on another human being, Muggle or wizard, they will receive a punishment in the form of a life sentence to Azkaban\n, unless there is enough evidence that the person who cast the spell did so while being under the influence of the Imperius Curse.)\nSo what does the Imperius Curse do?\nWhen cast successfully, it places the victim completely under the caster's control, though a person with exceptional strength of will is capable of resisting it. [1]\nLong story short:\nThe Imperius Curse can make anyone do anything.\nTotal control. I could make it jump out the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats.…\n-Barty Crouch Jr. as Alastor Moody on a spider he had put under Imperius Curse\nCarlos Osorio commented,\nThe Imperius Curse is by far the most messed up spell in the HP universe.\nAvada Kadavra? Quick, painless death. It’s a delete button. Terrible in the wrong hands, but not particularly dark, morbid, or depraved.\nCruciatus? Pure sadism, but practical as far as the use of torture goes and like AK there is a clear uninterrupted line between perpetrator and victim. It’s excruciatingly painful, but not especially unique in result. Just expedient.\nBut Imperius? Yikes. Rowling was wise not to display too much twisted creativity with the spell as the story could’ve gotten very dark, very quickly\nIncredibly cruel people, such as the Death Eaters, who are mean enough to use the Imperius Curse can make people do extremely terrible things unwillingly.\nThe following are a few examples to emphasize my point:\nWant to steal something valuable?\nHave someone do it for you.\nWant to destroy someone’s reputation?\nHave them do something very horrible in public.\nWant to kill a group of people in a particular place?\nUse an unwilling suicide bomber.\nWant to hurt someone deeply?\nMake them hurt the person they love the most.\nThat’s just what the Imperius curse can do - it can make people do terrible things against their will, and that is just truly dark.\nFootnotes\n[1] Imperius Curse",
      "4": "The result of Snape’s bullying caused a student to essentially GET PLASTIC SURGERY to fix her not even that bad teeth. When Hermione is hit by Malfoy’s jinx that makes her teeth grow past her collar bone and Ron tries to tell Snape he replies with “I see no difference”. He says that to a girl that is made fun of for who she is in the Wizarding World and has severe insecurities that are also glossed over (more on that later) and makes her feel even worse. It’s bad enough that students make fun of Hermione, but a TEACHER?\nSomething is seriously wrong (or should be wrong) with Hermione. Hermione is bullied for 6 years and has probably been doubted all throughout her career at the Ministry. Through close reading the book we can see that Hermione shows multiple insecurities because of how smart she is and because of her bullying. When her boggart is Professor McGonagall saying she failed everything, this is glossed over. Failing is Hermione’s biggest fear. Let that sink in. Hermione is more afraid of failing than death or zombies or anything else. It might be hard to imagine but think of what your worst fear is. Probably a close friend or family member dying, maybe death, heights…failing is pretty down on that list. This fear of failing is most evident around OWL time when Hermione is literally close to tears from stress and snaps at anyone.\nProfessor Trelawney is an addict. When Harry walks past her in HBP, he can smell cooking sherry, and that smell is strong. Later in the book, Harry also comments again on how much she smells like sherry. Even before he goes for Horcrux hunting he takes the time to realize that something is wrong. Professor Trelawney is seen with several bottles of sherry and also always seems tipsy. And when they walk away from the sherry, Harry can still smell it quite strongly.\nDumbledore doesn’t care for the well being of his staff. Harry mentions that Professor Trelawney has multiple bottles of sherry and hints at her having a stash and Dumbledore is unfazed. He doesn’t even bat an eye. Furthermore he tries to get Trelawney and Slughorn at the school because he needs them-I’m sorry-wants them.",
      "5": "Bellatrix Lestrange is THE crudest character\nShe was one of two female Death Eaters out of 28 in total. Imagine what it would have taken to reach this position in such a male dominant profession.\nShe, from head to toe, endorsed Voldemort’s ideology, and was ready to murder her family for it.\nRemember how pale Hagrid went when Azkaban was mentioned? Lestrange didn’t even flinch at the name but was proud to serve her sentence for 15 years.\nShe killed and tortured without an ounce of remorse.\nLongbottoms were tortured to insanity, Sirius was wiped out, Hermione was afflicted, and her bloodthirst ran high in the final battle. If she had lived longer, she might have created Horcruxes.\nShe stabbed Dobby in his chest when her wand failed, killing him.\nShe cheated on her husband, who was alive, having Delphi with Voldemort.\nShe had skills as good and high as Voldemort and Snape. Three people duelled with her at once, Draco learnt Occlumency from her, and she once fought while pregnant.\nAndromeda Tonks had THE saddest fate after the war; nobody cared\nShe lost almost ALL her family.\nA group of snatchers killed her husband.\nBellatrix, her sister, duelled her daughter Nymphadora to death.\nRemus got another extremely ungraceful and bland death by Dolohov’s wand.\nHer sisters — Narcissa and Bellatrix — were rather inclined to kill her.\nHer other sacrifices include daring to marry a muggle-born while being pure blood and being termed as a blood-traitor.\nHow FOOLISH and UNCARING the wizarding world is\n811 million.\nThat’s the population that goes to sleep with an empty stomach. The wizarding world can discreetly help them. But … they don’t care. Same thing with electricity, water and shelter.\nWho decided the curriculum and the education system? There is no option for higher education, no colleges for brainy humans like Hermione to learn better skills, no basic subjects like Maths and Language taught in school.\nElf labour — can I use the term slave? — is blatant and only Hermione cares. House-elves are like the illiterate peasants during the 18th century in France, waiting for someone to bring them to their senses.\nThe community is stagnating. Muggles will soon surpass them. There’s only one good news I can take out of this: Another series can be written with the Muggles as the antagonists.\nKnowing magic is perfect for being a criminal in the muggle world. You can do awful things to people, make them do actions out of their will, and obliviate their memories.\nHow LAX Hogwarts's security and system is\nDumbledore prohibits students to visit the Forbidden Forest without taking any measures. People like Fred and Harry would obviously be drawn to its mysteries.\nThe 4 pranksters of Hogwarts could “jokingly” make a map to show who everyone was with their position, but not a skilled wizard like Dumbledore to check any imposters? Overconfident?\nAnyone can get in or talk to a person inside the castle using Floo powder like what Sirius Black did in GoF.\nPortraits are extremely unreliable at times. Couldn’t sterner beings — armoured men, for instance — guard the dorms so no duel takes place at midnight?\nTeachers have no moral code.\nFilch can torture students, Snape can randomly take points from Gryffindor and give unfair detentions. And Dumbledore is a step ahead of him — his favouritism for Gryffindor is blatant.\nPeople can steal dangerous things easily. Hermione and Draco made Polyjuice Potion by stealing from the Potions’ cupboard; the forbidden section of the library isn’t exactly protected.\nThe Room of Requirements is (almost) infallible and perilous. Isn’t it scary that anyone, without a trace of them, can go there and do anything of their choice? This is a nightmare for teachers — if they care.",
      "6": "Hermione's parents.\nAt the beginning of the Deathly Hallows, Hermione casually mentions to Ron and Harry that she altered her parents' memories and gave them new identities as Wendell and Monica Wilkins who wish to move to Australia, to protect them from the Death Eaters.\nImagine for a second, doing that to your parents, whom you have known all your life, who you know loves you more than anyone else in the entire world. If something goes wrong, then Hermione is left parentless.\nHermione made the biggest sacrifice of them all, but no one even bothered to check how she was doing with it throughout the entire period. She left her parents in such a state to fight along with Ron and Harry.\nThat takes guts and a huge amount of bravery. For a child to do that to their own parents for whatever reason, is extraordinary I think.\nBut sadly, it is just ignored in the book and the movie. A mere bump on the road in the whole scheme of things.",
      "7": "Exposure to horcruxes affect people, but Harry was a horcrux too…\nWe have seen that Ron was affected while he was carrying the Slytherin's Locket. Ginny was also affected by the Riddle's Diary. But Harry was a horcrux too. And he's been living with the Dursleys since he was a baby. It could be possible that the Dursleys were affected by Harry and originally they might have been a little nicer to Harry. Although it is said that a horcrux can detect potential threat to itself and affect the people to defendd itself. However, we can't ignore the fact that it can affect people at its will. As Harry had been around many people who are a threat to Voldemort, the horcrux could have caused much more harm in the story.\nEdit: This point seems quite invalid given the explanations in comments. Although, Harry carrying a part of Voldemort in himself is a quite dark fact itself which is quite overlooked. That is why I'm keeping this point in my answer. Thank you everyone.\nBeing expelled is really worse than death\nThere are only 7 years of study in the wizarding world. If you are expelled then you have no permission to use magic yet you have to survive in the wizarding world which is quite impossible for someone who is not allowed to do magic. Moreover, he or she cannot go to the muggle world for not having any type of knowledge about how to survive in thehe muggle world. Thus, if you are expelled, your whole life is doomed as everyone is not as lucky as Hagrid to get a job because of Dumbledore.",
      "8": "The obliviate spell is pretty dark. Imagine all of your memories being wiped out, and having to rebuild your life up after being an adult. Just being stuck in a hospital like St. Mungo's for the rest of your life.\nSure, it's very comical when Lockhart loses all his memory and asks stupid questions. Sure, Lockhart can be funny. But he also rid several people of their memories and greatest achievements of saving their village. He also tried to rid the memories of twelve year olds!\nLockhart is definitely a dark topic.\nAnother example of the obliviate curse being overused is when Hermione rids her parent's memory of their own daughter.\nI know that she returns and gives them back their memories. But what if she was killed?\nYou can justify it all you want, but what Hermione did to her parents is still a dark concept. Whether it was for the greater good or not, what Hermione had to do was dark. It is a dark idea in general the pain that it may have caused her. It is dark that they had to unwillingly forget about their only child.\nOverall, obliviate is a dark concept for sure. Gilderoy Lockhart in general seems like a despicable human being.",
      "9": "There is a single line of dialogue in Harry Potter that has always kind of disturbed me\nʹI havenʹt looked at this for years. Thereʹs Phineas Nigellus… my great‐great‐ grandfather, see?… least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had… and Araminta Mehflua… cousin of my mothers… tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle‐hunting legal… and dear Aunt Elladora… she started the family tradition of beheading house‐elves when they got too old to carry tea trays… of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isnʹt on here. Maybe thatʹs why Kreacher wonʹt take orders from her ‐ heʹs supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him ‐ʹ\nThis paragraph is on page 95 of OOTP (Sirius to Harry)\nSo apparently, Araminta Meliflua (a cousin of Sirius Black’s mother) tried to force a bill to make Muggle Hunting legal.\nBruh?\nSo basically legal homicide.\nApparently the more “previleged” parts of the wizarding world seemed to think that muggles are somehow sup par or well beneath them and it just baffles me so much.\nThe only reason a wizard is superior is because of his wand, and as wandless magic is pretty unheard of, it makes them pretty weak and vulnerable in front of an armed (or even an unarmed muggle, as i’m pretty sure wizards are not trained in martial arts)\nSo to even think that you could release a muggle in an open field like a turkey and then shoot arrows at him is pretty fucking mad.\nIt is a relief that a better part of the wizarding society has a bit of humanity in them, or else they probably would have perished a long time ago.",
      "10": "The fact that a powerful r*pe drug is sold to minors without any law enforcement or parent ever batting an eye. I’m talking about Amortentia\nStudents need a parental consent to go on brief weekend trips to a nearby town. Ok, seems reasonable.\nWhat is completely nonsensical is that a school is able to house a literal hellhound\nSoul-sucking abominations\nA convicted murderer and torturer\nEither without noticing, without asking consent from the parents or the school board or without anyone raising even the slightest complaint.",
      "11": "One that I don't think I've seen people talk about much is the dragon situation.\nSo we know about dragons from the books. We know they exist in the wild. We know people breed them. We know Charlie Weasley works with them in Romania. We know they're generally illegal to keep, at least in Britain.\nThe wizard world seems to deal with them in the same way they deal with other magical creatures. That is, they try to confine them to their natural habitats, keep muggles away (obliviate ones that see them), and regulate their trade.\nBut then what happens when the Triwizard tournament comes around? Three (four in Harry's case) innocent dragons, nesting mothers no less, are captured and forced into an arena to combat a wizard in a no holds barred fight to, potentially, the death!\nThis is very reminiscent of bull fighting in Spain, or Roman colosseum combat. Horrible thing, but crowds of baying wizards seem to love this blood sport.",
      "12": "Amortentia: the perfectly legal and 100% acceptable date rape drug, that is freely (and equally) sold to adults and minors.\nDropping infants on their heads to see if they’re magical: not even frowned upon. What if the kid wasn’t magical? Would the resulting death be equally acceptable?\nA 100+ year old man intentionally exposing a minor to grave danger just to see if that child “has it in him” to bring about the downfall of the darkest wizard of his time\nPolyjuice: becoming anyone you want while retaining your mind and personality: don’t tell me no one used it just to see what their crush looked like naked…. Fleur had it right “I look hideous!”\nDementors: talk about cruel and unusual psychological punishment\nExtreme tolerance of bullies, both in the past and in the present\nAttempted murder has no meaning in the HP series\nNeed I go on?",
      "13": "What is something that is really dark in the Harry Potter series that is really just kind of ignored?\nFrankly, the darkest thing in the series that is kind of ignored outside of the fanfiction corner of the fandom is how badly abused Harry was at the Dursleys, and how much more his life was f***ed up after the end of the Triwizard Tournament.\nMost people never really stop to think about how tragic Harry’s life was for the first 17 years of his life.\nIt somehow escapes people how horrifying Harry’s abuse at the hands of Dursleys was. If Vernon and Petunia had been caught out, they would have likely faced some prison time (even back in the 1980’s) and Harry and Dudley would have been put in Foster Care.\nOutside of the fanfiction community (which—despite how large it is—is really just a fraction of the larger fandom) the majority of fans are like, “Yeah, the Dursleys are kind of mean, but Harry didn’t have it that bad—not as bad as people who are really abused”.\nAnd a few people in that group (a small minority—most of whom seem to be Snape Apologists) go as far as to say (in essence) that “The Dursleys were financially burdened by Harry’s presence, and Harry was a juvenile delinquent so he kind of deserved to be punished.”\nAnd somehow most people seem to miss Harry’s PTSD and how hellish Harry’s fifth year was (and it really didn’t get any better for him in sixth and seventh year).\nThe majority of fans seem to fall into one of two categories: One group asks, “Why is Harry all caps in OotP?” because they are honestly confused. … The other people say, “Fifteen year old Harry is a typical angsty teen acting out and behaving badly,” because they’re not paying attention but they think they actually know what they’re talking about (they don’t).\nThere really isn’t enough room in one answer to make the case for both point 1 and point 2, so I’ll focus on point 1.\nHere is the link to the case for point 2:\nNathan Beard's answer to What would Harry Potter be diagnosed with if he went to see a therapist?\nThis is the “short” version of the case for point 1:[1]\nSome of the abuse Harry suffered would violate the Geneva Conventions if he was a prisoner of war, and they certainly violate the UN’s Rights of the Child and many laws in the UK and the US. This is all the evidence for extreme child abuse in the series which I have collected to date:\nChild Abuse in Harry Potter\nMy blog post is too long to post in full, so I will try to focus on a few key scenes which rebut some of the claims made by one or two particular Snape Apologists (and which are then repeated by many others who believe the claims). One might well ask, why focus on rebutting the arguments of these particular Snape Apologists?\nBecause they are prolific, and well-known Quorans. They spread disinformation, and more often than not misquote the books without providing the citation or textual evidence to support their assertions. And they justify and downplay Harry’s abuse at the hands of the Dursleys in aid of their goal to downplay and excuse Snape’s abuse of Harry. All quotes are taken directly from some of their answers.\nSnape Apologist: He suffered from emotional abuse and moderate physical neglect, not extreme neglect.\nThis is the claim by some that Harry was “only” emotionally abused and neglected by the Dursleys as a way of dismissing the severity of such abuse.\nHere is what some actual experts have to say:\nChild Abuse and Neglect by Leah Davies, M.Ed.\nEmotional abuse happens when adults thwart a child's mental health and/or his or her social, emotional and/or cognitive development. It may include using extreme or bizarre forms of punishment, such as locking the child in a closet…\nChild abuse: Types, signs, and reporting possible abuse\nChild neglect is when a parent or caregiver persistently fails to meet the basic physical and psychological needs of a child, resulting in impairment of the child's health or development. It can involve:\nlocking a child in a room or closet\nLocking a kid in a closet is SO bad that it is apparently considered extreme and bizarre by some experts. We’ll be coming back to the closet after tackling the next part of the false claims:\nSnape Apologist: He wasn’t starved (except for two or three days following the incident where the family thought he had deliberately wrecked the dinner on which their whole financial future depended),\nFirst, just to be clear, the notion that the Dursleys’ “whole financial future” was on the line, is just completely made up—talk about fanfiction. Vernon was hoping to buy another house with the deal.\nCoS ch 1:\n“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.”\nSecond, note how the starvation Harry suffered following that incident is also being presented as if it was justifiable.\nThird, it’s presented in a dismissive manner—”except for two or three days”—as if it wasn’t really that bad.\nAnyway, here is what the books have to say about the topic of starvation.\nCoS ch 2:\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day.\n[…]\nDobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d probably starve to death anyway.\n[…]\nThe cat flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it.\n[…]\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.\n[…]\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.\nThe excerpt indicates that Harry was indeed occasionally deprived of adequate food to the point of starvation for extended periods as punishment. To be at the point of Exhaustion when you haven’t exerted yourself is a serious and dangerous sign of malnutrition.\nWhich belies the claims of those who point to the quote that Harry “had never exactly [been] starved” (PS ch 7) and say that means that Harry had never deliberately been deprived of food to the point of starvation. … Such claims are intentionally designed to present the Dursleys in the best light and dismiss their abuse of Harry as inconsequential and/or indicate that they had never abused Harry at all.\nIn fact, the phrase “not exactly starved” is simply another way of stating that sometimes Harry was nearly starved.\nThis is further evidenced by an excerpt from Philosopher’s Stone, following the Zoo Incident (Uncle Vernon was apparently too angry that afternoon to immediately lock Harry in his cupboard).\nPS ch 2:\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\nAnd that’s not the only time that Harry was punished by not feeding him:\nCoS ch 1: The Worst Birthday\n\"Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself… maybe he didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts…\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.\n“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven,\n“Eat quickly! The Mason’s will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.\nHarry was put to work just after breakfast—so Harry had to work 11 or 12 hours—in the heat—with no food (and no indication that he was given anything to drink). …….. (And note that this also rebuts the idea that Harry never had excessive chores. Sometimes he WAS given excessive chores as a punishment).\nWhen he was finished with all that work, what did Petunia give Harry for dinner? … Certainly not the pork loin sizzling in the oven. Harry was given two slices of bread and a lump of cheese! … Happy twelfth birthday Harry! :P\nAnd, in Goblet of Fire, when Dudley was put on a diet, Harry was given even less food, to make Dudley feel better about his diet:\nGoF ch 3:\nTo make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley's morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.\nAnd then there is this, in Deathly Hallows:\nDH ch 15:\nThis was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had experienced periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’.\nSo now, maybe we can lay to rest the claims made by some (certain Snape fans in particular), that Harry was never starved by the Dursleys. These claims are categorically false. Harry was sometimes starved by the Dursleys—intentionally.\nSnape fan: He wasn’t starved (except for two or three days following the incident where the family thought he had deliberately wrecked the dinner on which their whole financial future depended), or beaten, or made to do excessive chores - all that stuff comes from fanfiction.\nSo, when it comes to physical abuse, including beatings, that Snape fan (and others) simply chooses not to see the evidence in the text:\nPS Ch 3:\nHe [Uncle Vernon] looked so dangerous with half his moustache missing that no-one dared to argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding to the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the backseat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up when he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\nRight! Well, if this is how Uncle Vernon treats Dudley, aka Diddykins—the prized son who is spoiled rotten and doted upon, while Harry is neglected and despised—when Vernon is irate, are we then to presume that the hated Harry is treated better than Dudley, and never struck by Uncle Vernon?\nOf course not!\nThis is clear evidence that Uncle Vernon is a violent man, and most certainly had struck Harry in anger on more than one occasion.\nTo continue:\nPS Ch 4:\n“Now you listen here, boy,” he [Uncle Vernon] snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured—and as far as all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion—asked for all they got, getting up mixed up with those wizarding types—just what I always expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end—”\nNow, one might well ask why include this piece of dialogue? Because this is a piece of dialogue that some people claim proves that Uncle Vernon never hit Harry. But anyone who is being honest can see that it proves nothing of the sort.\nVernon isn’t claiming that he never hit, or beat, Harry, only that Harry hasn’t been beaten “good.” Which is a common theme expressed by abusive parental figures who are self-aware enough not to beat a child so badly that they need medical attention.\nCoS ch 1:\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.\nIf that “heavy blow” had connected with Harry’s head, Voldemort could have won without ever lifting a finger himself. A heavy blow to the head with a frying pan can cause Traumatic Brain Injury, even death.\nCos ch 2:\nAunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\n“No,” croaked Harry. “Please… they’ll kill me…”\n“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school—”\n“Dobby… please…”\n“Say it, sir…”\n“I can’t—”\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\n“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good.”\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our nephew—very disturbed—meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs…”) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.\nSome people may scoff, and claim that it is an empty threat, but, as indicated in chapter 3 of Philosopher’s Stone wherein he hit Dudley, Vernon is given to bouts of violence when enraged.\nI see another response (from someone other than the Snape fan) to this question that claims that Harry wasn’t scared of the Dursleys. I’m not sure whether to face-palm or head-desk at that claim. This is just one of a number of instances in which Harry is afraid of the Dursleys. In the scene above, Harry is so scared that he’s trembling.\nCoS Ch 2:\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic gleam in tiny eyes.\n“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. “Go on—read it!”\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\n[…]\n“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic outside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam in his eyes. “Forgot to mention it. … Slipped your mind, I daresay. …”\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ... I’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that school...never...and if you try and magic yourself out—they’ll expel you!”\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry upstairs.\nNo wonder Uncle Vernon is laughing like a maniac. He now knows that Harry cannot protect himself with magic without risking expulsion.\nWe’re never told explicitly that Vernon gave Harry a beating once he physically “dragged Harry upstairs,” but at this point, given the context provided in Philosopher’s Stone when Vernon hit Dudley “round the head,” it would be more than reasonable for us to safely conclude, with certainty, that Vernon did hit Harry a few times, more than a few times really—i.e. that Vernon gave Harry a beating.\nThen we come to this famous incident:\nOotP ch 1:\nHarry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.\nSure, it’s reminiscent of the Simpsons—but strangulation is no joke! … And we’re meant to take it seriously.\nNote that Vernon’s not afraid of physically assaulting fifteen year old Wizard Harry. Just as Petunia aiming a heavy blow at nearly twelve year old Wizard Harry’s head is very telling. It shows that the Dursleys are not particularly afraid of Harry, even when he has a wand and could take a chance of defending himself.\nThey feel comfortable physically assaulting Teenage Wizard Harry, because they had clearly been doing it for some time, long before he went to Hogwarts, when he was weaker.\nThere is another critical piece of dialogue in Order of the Phoenix—clear evidence that Uncle Vernon had hit Harry on more than one occasion—perhaps the only time that Harry let slip to Hermione just how awful things were for him at the Dursleys.\nBut in true Harry fashion—like a number of abused kids who try to keep it to themselves and/or have grown somewhat inured to the violence and come to view it as a normal part of their life—Harry plays it down and makes a bit of a joke out of it:\nOotP Ch 29:\n“Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?” said Hermione absently. She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS? “You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!”\n“You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.”\nFinally we come to this point in Half-Blood Prince, which really brings it all home.\nHBP Ch 3:\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist length silver hair and beard.\nIn conjunction with all the other evidence up to this point, this really is definitive proof that the adult Dursleys—especially Uncle Vernon—physically abused Harry on a regular basis before he attended Hogwarts, and even on some occasions after Harry had started Hogwarts. Sixteen year old Harry is STILL scared of being within arm’s length of Uncle Vernon, even with Dumbledore standing in the doorway.\nOkay, that’s another False Claim by the Snape Fan in question thoroughly debunked.\nNow for the cupboard-under-the-stairs:\nSnape Apologist: The notorious cupboard under the stairs was big enough to hold Harry, Vernon and a proper bed at the same time, so it was a small room, not a tiny cupboard. If it had been all that was available, and properly decorated, it would probably have been adequate, even cute, for a child’s bedroom. What was abusive was that a huge difference was constantly made between him and Dudley, and Dudley got two full size rooms and piles of birthday presents, while Harry got this tiny room and 50p (enough to buy himself a few sweets or a comic).\nOkay, this is absolutely revolting to read!\nIt’s all well and good to note that “What was abusive was that a huge difference was constantly made between him and Dudley.” … But the context of the (SEVERE) abuse of forcing a child to live in a cupboard for ten years makes “the huge difference” look petty, and not such a big deal—it’s a way of minimising the abuse that Harry suffered.\nNot to mention that ‘Snape Fan’ felt it necessary to add “(enough to buy himself a few sweets or a comic)”—which is their way of saying, “Well, at least he got a few sweets or a comic.” Another sickening display of downplaying Harry’s abuse.\n‘Snape Fan’ said something very similar in one of their other answers:\n“[Harry’s] cupboard was a small room, not the little thing you see in the films - it held Harry, a proper bed and Vernon at the same time without apparent difficulty.”\nFirst things first:\nMaking a small child live in a cupboard for ten years is already criminal child abuse—in many jurisdictions nowadays that’s practically a guaranteed prison sentence for the abuser.\nIt’s also worth pointing out, that unlike in the films, Harry’s cupboard didn’t even have a light—it is consistently referred to as a dark cupboard in the books.\nThe claim is also often made that Harry was never locked in the dark cupboard, the following passages demonstrate that the cupboard was dark, and that it was sometimes locked:\nPS ch 2:\nHarry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n[…]\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.\n[…]\nThe Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.\n[…]\nNext morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n[…]\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.\nA whole week—in a dark cupboard. Harry already slept in the cupboard, so the text is telling us that Harry was forced to stay in the cupboard for all of his waking hours too (except for school).\nPS ch 2:\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started.\nDudley’s birthday is June 23rd. In the UK, schools generally let out for summer holidays in the third week of July. Harry was forced to stay in a dark cupboard all of his waking hours (except for school) for FOUR WEEKS!!!\nBut wait, there is more. There is another piece of strong evidence in Prisoner of Azkaban—in the very first chapter—that Harry was locked in his dark cupboard:\nPoA Ch 1:\nHarry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow.\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\nWhen Harry risked the wrath of the Dursleys to get his homework done, he was worried that they might actually imprison him in the cupboard under the stairs again for weeks, behind a locked door.\nSo the evidence is clear: The cupboard had no light and sometimes Harry’s extended periods of incarceration were enforced by locking the cupboard door.\nOkay, let’s back up a bit:\nPlease, someone tell me exactly where in Philosopher’s Stone Harry’s “proper bed” in the cupboard was mentioned?\nCan someone tell me where in Philosopher’s Stone it says that the cupboard which allegedly held Harry, Uncle Vernon, and the contrived “proper bed” all at the same time “without apparent difficulty” was actually “a small room, not the little thing you see in the films?”\nNothing could be further from the truth. There is no mention at all in Philosopher’s Stone of a “proper bed” in the cupboard, and the-cupboard-under-the-stairs is never described as “a small room” in Philosopher’s Stone (more on that below).\nAs to the apparent difficulty of fitting Vernon, Harry, and the “proper bed” in the cupboard, this is what the book has to say:\nPS ch 3:\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me?\"\nHmm… “squeezed through the door.”\nDoes that sound like “without apparent difficulty” to you? “Squeezed” sounds quite difficult to me.\nIn fact, here, right in the text, is an actual description of the cupboard-under-the-stairs:\nDH ch 4:\n“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. “We’ll never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. ...”\nHarry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.\n“And under here, Hedwig”—Harry pulled open a door under the stairs—“is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then—Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. ...”\nHarry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once—Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it—a flying motorbike...\nThere was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.\nLet THIS sink in for a minute:\nHarry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame.\nHuh! … “Low door frame” … The next time you hear someone on Quora claim that Harry’s small cupboard-under-the-stairs was a “small room,” shove this in their face.\nThere is no possibility of Harry’s cupboard under the stairs being a small room. That is why—in the books—it is called a cupboard instead of a “small room.”\nThis is the standard size for all cupboards under the stairs. The movie gets it right (except for the light—Harry’s did not have a light, as I pointed out above). No cupboard under the stairs can ever be big enough to be considered a “small room”—there just isn’t the space.\nFor comparison:\nThe CIA classifies this as torture:\n10 CIA torture tactics revealed\nCramped confinement\nThe suspect is placed in a dark and confined space. Confinement in a larger space can last up to 18 hours, in a smaller space it is supposed to be less than two hours.\nSo Harry was living under those conditions for ten years, and sometimes Harry was LOCKED in his SMALL DARK CUPBOARD as punishment for EXTENDED periods of time.\nThe Dursleys straight up TORTURED Harry.\nIt’s remarkable how well he turned out, all things considered. But kids aren’t all the same, and they don’t all react the same to abuse.\nNathan Beard's answer to Why doesn't Harry Potter have any significant mental health issues given his abusive upbringing?\nFootnotes\n[1] Nathan Beard's answer to Why is Harry Potter's abuse never touched up on that much? He at least suffered from extreme neglect, so why isn't it brought up all that much?",
      "14": "What is an extremely dark element of the Harry Potter story that gets completely overlooked?\nThe absolutely stark blind faith every wizard and witch seemed to have in Albus Dumbledore, despite the headmaster providing pretty much no answer to stopping Lord Voldemort over the course of almost thirty years.\n“It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.” (Remus Lupin)\n“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s wrong about Snape —”\n“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.”\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix — J.K. Rowling\nIt’s somewhat haunting and not just a little bit frightening, when you think about it — that no one who spent any amount of time with him ever came away questioning Albus Dumbledore.\nActually, that’s not completely true. There were a few Dumble-doubters. Cornelius Fudge. Dolores Umbridge. Rita Skeeter. Rufus Scrimgeour.\nNow… Umbridge and Skeeter…. okay. They were both a couple of conniving, rhymes-with-witches. Rita never went near Albus, anyway.\nCornelius Fudge? Yeah, he was nothing but a hanger-on, letting Dumbledore do his dirty work for him, until it started to reflect badly on Cornelius. Then, Cornelius turned on Albus.\nBut Rufus Scrimgeour? I think most people who have a reasonably open mind could see, Rufus and Albus could have been allies. Should have been, really. But instead, they ended up locking horns. And not because Rufus didn’t try. It was really because Dumbledore couldn’t easily influence Scrimgeour, and that was dangerous for Dumbledore’s plans for Harry Potter.\nStill, whatever their motives, these four were among the few wizards who questioned Dumbledore’s motives and secrecy.\nAnd they all shared something else in common — none of them spent a whole hell of a lot of time with Albus Dumbledore.\nThe rest of the wizarding world? Hey, if you worked at Hogwarts or were an Order of the Phoenix member, well, then, whatever Dumbledore said, so it went. Heck, Albus even has that affect on the majority of Potter fans.\nBut here’s the thing about Dumbledore vs. Voldemort. We, the readers, always had our theories as to why it took so long for Dumbledore to bring down Voldemort. The most popular theory is that Dumbledore didn’t want to bring a final end to Voldemort until all of the Horcruxes were found.\nThere’s a lot of holes in that idea, but it’s the one that most easily explains why the greatest wizard who ever lived took somewhere between a quarter- to a half-century to finally bring down the most evil wizard who ever lived.\nBecause some of us think Albus knew about Tom Riddle’s Horcruxes going all the way back to the early 1940s, when Dumbledore urged Armando Dippet to do away with the textbooks that discussed how to create a Horcrux.\nOthers think it was later, perhaps by the time Voldemort interviewed for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position. Yet more of us think it wasn’t until Harry Potter survived Voldemort’s attack at Godric’s Hollow. And then, there’s the standard, which is, he figured it out when Harry brought him Tom Riddle’s mangled Diary.\nThe problem is, none of the witches and wizards in the Potter universe were privy to what we know. They just kind of went along with Dumbledore because he was Albus Dumbledore, and no one ever questions the great Albus Dumbledore, right?\nBut didn’t any of them ever wonder how he intended to ultimately defeat Voldemort? Didn’t anyone want to know what the plan was? Why didn’t anyone ask or express any doubt?\nWe could say…. maybe they did, but only in private. After all the story is from a single point of view, Harry Potter’s, so it’s possible it just occurred off screen. That’s a popular explanation for some of the more gaping plot holes — that (fill in the blank here) happened off-screen, we just never saw it.\nExcept, no one ever hesitated whenever they were called on to perform a task at Dumbledore’s bidding. No one ever said, “I had my reservations, but I did what Dumbledore asked anyway,” or “I did as he said, but I still don’t really get why.”\nIt was always, “I trust Dumbledore, therefore, I do what Dumbledore says I should.” There was something almost Stepford-Wife-ish about it.\nAnd the thing is, they all had good reason to question Dumbledore. Because the good guys were losing during the First Wizarding War. And badly.\nRemus Lupin mentioned that towards the end of the First Wizarding War, the Order of the Phoenix was being overwhelmed by Voldemort’s Death Eaters.\n“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one....” (Remus to Molly at 12 Grimmauld Place)\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix — J.K. Rowling\nIn the First Wizarding War, the Order was losing members left and right, yet, no one questioned what Dumbledore’s plan to stem the losses was, even just within the Order itself, let alone the magical community at large. Everyone just kept going merrily along with whatever Dumbledore said.\nEven when the Second Wizarding War started, the remaining and new Order members and even a couple of Aurors who weren’t involved in the first war, they all fall in line and just continue to put themselves in harm’s way on behalf of Albus Dumbledore.\nIt was like everyone gave Dumbledore the credit for destroying Voldemort at Godric’s Hollow, despite the fact that Dumbledore wasn’t within a hundred miles.\nSo, if we were to kick around some theories about what appears to be a really dark aspect of the Harry Potter universe, one of us might say, maybe, it wasn’t Voldemort who was the greatest Legilimens the world had ever seen.\nMaybe his old Transfiguration instructor at Hogwarts was.\nAnd maybe Albus Dumbledore was using his immense powers to \"persuade\" a great many witches and wizards to get onboard the Dumbledore bandwagon.\nNot necessarily confunding or memory altering. Just kind of nudging people in the direction he wanted with his Legilimency skills.\nAnd if you were one of the few who couldn't be moved, suddenly, you were made to look like the bad guy.",
      "15": "One thing that is both dark and ignored:\nRowling’s theme of tolerance is quite clear. Good guys are fine with Muggle/Wizard interbreeding, bad guys are not. The problem is that this is not at all reflected in the text. Almost every single character is either Muggle born, or pure wizard. There are virtually no examples of a character with one muggle and one wizard parent. I think the only exceptions are Voldemort, Snape, and Dean Thomas.\nIt’s frankly hard to imagine how such pairings could even happen. Nobody in the Wizarding world has any Muggle friends. Even such paragons of decency as Hagrid and Mr. Weasley are dismissive of Muggles and their problems. Weasley is fascinated by Muggles, and collecting their artifacts, yet he doesn’t seem to actually know a single thing about them. He’s sort of like a guy who loves collecting African masks, and then tells every black person he knows how amazing it is that they can use electricity. Paternalistic and patronizing seems to be the attitude, and those are the good guys!\nRowling does little to help her theme by depicting almost all Muggle characters as hapless buffoons, like the Prime Minister, villains like the Dursleys, or relegating them to the background altogether, as in the case of the Grangers. In the entire series, I can’t think of a single Muggle character who is written as an actual human being, let alone one who interacts with wizards as an equal.",
      "16": "THE DEMENTORS.\nI know, they’re meant to be the good guys, making sure the prisoners don’t escape Azkaban. But these are literal happiness-draining soul-sucking demons we’re talking about here. But more absurdly, the ministry actually uses them!\nIt’s even shown in HP4 that Fudge has his own personal dementor to accompany him when needs be.\nIt’s just something that’s really dark and also really stupid. J.K. Rowling said herself that her least favorite magical creature was the Dementor. I know these creatures are meant to guard prisoners and drain them of the energy they’d need to escape, but come on. They may be criminals but they are still humans. And there are people in there who have genuinely realized that they need to change, and want to repent, but we as readers forget about these people because the majority of the attention we have on Azkaban are the death eaters, the people who have sworn themselves to an eternity of evildoing. We never think about the damage being done to people who are wrongly accused, or are only here for a short amount of time, or actually want to repent and show that they are sorry. It’s so dark when you put it into perspective. We just ignore it because we direct all our attention to the minority of Death Eaters who have been locked up in Azkaban.",
      "17": "In universe: Polyjuice potion.\nSomeone can just grab a single fallen strand of your hair, and that’s enough to allow them to turn into an exact copy of you. They could do anything during that time. They would have free access to your bank account, to your workplace, to everyone you love. They could ruin your entire life in minutes. The possibilities are many and highly disturbing.\nAnd wizards basically seem to be… okay… with… this?? There are two moments in the entire series where someone seems to remember that, oh, right, people can look like totally different people (when the Order of the Phoenix members question each other post-escape from Privet Drive, and the anti-magic waterfall in Gringotts, which is located way too deep in the bank to be helpful).\nOther than that, nobody is double-checking that people are who they seem to be. Not in the Ministry. Not in Gringotts. Not in the super-secret underground resistance group. Even after a death eater masquerades as someone else for an entire year. The response seems to basically be “oh well, hope that doesn’t happen again.”\nwhy would anyone do that again just because it was incredibly effective?\nLike, they know that Voldemort is back, they know he’s actively trying to kill Harry Potter, and yet nobody is taking any precautions to make sure a random death eater can’t just transform into Seamus and Avada him?\nIf anything like Polyjuice potion existed in the real world it would change everything. Nobody would so much as give their spouse a welcome-home kiss without double-checking their identity. Hair nets would be a constant. It would be standard to schedule regular check-ins where you have to contact a certain person and give a passcode, just to make sure nobody can take your place unnoticed.

      "18": "Pictures\nAll across Hogwarts and the rest of the wizarding world, sentient pictures are hanging all over the walls. The Fat Lady, as seen above, is condemned to an actual eternity of being kept inside the confines of her painting, with nothing to do except a 24/7 duty of allowing Gryffindor’s students in and out of the common room if they say the correct password.\nNow, it is established that paintings can move around to different frames, almost, I suppose, like a network of portals set up across the globe. But they very seldom move beyond their corridor, unless they are ordered to like slaves (like when Dumbledore ordered one of the old headmasters to give news to the paintings in St Mungos), or when they are stolen (when the Fat Lady went missing).\nPaintings can be bought or sold completely against their will. They are slaves as much as Star Wars droids, except Star Wars droids have the ability to move around independently of their masters. Once installed, they are expected to sit there looking pretty like some kind of, well, oil painting, or else face the extreme disappointment, or even the wrath of their masters. After all, why buy a painting if it’s just going to leave? There has got to be something preventing the paintings from moving around according to the free will which they so clearly display when they interact with the human characters, perhaps doing so with a tinge of sadness that they shall never know the freedom that the humans do. When founding SPEW, did Hermione Granger never consider the possibility that paintings had it far, far worse? Perhaps she would have achieved more had she founded SPPW instead?\nAnd this never had to be the case. Muggle paintings are completely inanimate, showing no more signs of life than the repetitive motions of a GIF (which, to be fair, is an accurate description of a lot of printed wizard photos). All across the world, wizards and witches are deliberately painting these portraits, knowing that they will from the moment they bring life, to the moment the picture is destroyed (I would hope), the figure who has been painted will be bought, sold, hung up, and given freedom of movement so restricted it makes North Korea’s border control look like the Floo Network.\nThis is cruelty on a massive scale, and it must not under any circumstances be allowed to continue!\n#freethepaintings #portraitlivesmatter",

No, they get their heads cut off when they're too old to be useful, as mentioned in the order of the Phoenix.\n\"His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother.\nThese intelligent species, that can communicate with humans, are reduced to slaves in this society. And when Hermione mentions this, she is treated as radical, despite of how common they are to humans.\nThe treatment of house elves is something really dark, but only gets mentioned by Hermione, and a bit by Dumbledore.\nThanks for Reading;~)",
      "20": "This might anger a few fans — soz…\nHarry Potter’s conviction that he’s right\nI hear you — he’s our main character, oughtn’t he be the moral compass in the series?\nWell, if he were, that would be one rather malfunctioning compass.\nAfter all, it’s largely thanks to his conviction that he alone knows what’s really going on that Sirius died. This is just a single example of Harry’s honest belief that he knew far more than any of the adults in the series — observe how easy it was for Voldemort to manipulate him because of it. Imagine if the stakes had been higher? Or if Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna and Ginny had been killed/seriously injured? As it was, Hermione nearly died.\nWhat about when Malfoy was tasked with getting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and offing Dumbledore? Whilst the road to hell was definitely paved with good intentions, Harry could have forced Malfoy to concoct something even more disastrous than his cursed necklace plan. His sheer lack of concern for any other than getting to the root of what Malfoy was up to could very well have got people killed.\nPlus, I suppose attempting an Unforgivable Curse on someone is fine when it’s against an antagonist? When it’s Bellatrix or Amycus? What message does that send out — that the good guys are above reproach when they’re angry?\nAnd what about mouthing off at your friends when you’re in a generally disagreeable mood? Instructing your owl to claw your best mates until you receive the sort of response you’d like for your letters? Isn’t it awfully sadistic to enjoy the presence of wounds on your friends’ hands — that you indirectly put there? I think Ron and Hermione are much better friends than Harry deserved, in that regard.\nJust because Harry’s the main character, we’re expected to think of him as the shining hero of the story.\nI’d go so far as to agree that he’s a hero — but he’s certainly no white knight.\nHe’s impulsive and reckless, has a tendency to treat his friends like sh*t when he’s in one of his moods, and often sees things as either entirely black or entirely white.\nIf you ask me, the darkest thing about the Harry Potter series is how easily its main character could have been a serious antagonist.",
      "21": "To be quiet honest, once you look deeper into it the series does take a rather nightmarish turn.\nI mean, look at the world. Things that, for us, are the stuff of pure nightmares and deep phobias are just jokes to wizard. Make someones tongue so big he nearly chokes on it? That is, for them, literally just a joke because to them, it has no consequence. Now, how many of us are disturbed by body-horror again?\nA broken leg and a cracked skull? It does not matter. There are no consequences.\nI bellieve there is a statement of JK where she says that there is nothing muggles contract that they cannot cure. That alone makes them pretty much completely beyond understanding for us. Imagine getting your freaking arm de-boned and seing it as a joke.\nA wizard, even if a bit messed up and without help, could just stand up and go into the library to look up his cure.\nBut a muggle cannot do that. He cannot do magic. He will need to go and another wizard to help him. Imagine how frustrating that would have to be.\nLove potions, obliviations and yes, even unbreakable oaths and “slavery” are completely normal things for wizards and witches.\nOne of these things would already be enough to start a war.\nMuggles (and most wizards) have no way to defend themselves from any of this. Someone wants to sleep with you, but you said no? Lovepotion Number 9 and the problems dealt with.\nYou could commit any crime you want and just obliviate the victim.\nIt would for one also be very very hard for muggles to accept House Elves. Especially since noone actually has a clue if they are really enslaved or just symbiotic. (Because Dobby folks, is the ONLY elf that seemingly wants to be free. The others don’t want that for their life.)\nAnd it just gets worse with a single word:\nLegilimency.\nJust how many of us actuallly have nightmares of having your most private thoughts read? Worst of all, the single and sole countermeasure, Occlumency, is not only rather unpopular since it can make you immune against truth serum (and isn’t THAT another discussion in it’s entirety?) it is also obviously magical and therefor cannot be learned by muggles.\nAnd “Magical Beasts” pretty much proves that a good Legilimence can read your entire mind like freaking book, even without eye-contact.\nThen we come to the physical stuff, like Metamorphmagi and Animagi. What you could do with these things. As Rita Skeeter proves, you could literally be the fly on the wall, everywhere, everytime.\nMetamorphmagi don’t even need to be explained. Yes, gender bending on comand has to be a dream for some, but imagine forgetting what you actually looked like.\nOr, you know, a metamorph just taking your place. Combine that with Legilimency and you will have a unstoppable, unfindable nightmare that can also teleport.\nAnd make himself well and truly unfindable via muggle repelling, notice-me-not or even Fidelius. Add to that the Imperius curse and you can pretty much never trust anyone again. It does not even need to be THEM. If anyone in your country is up to bad stuff, say goodbye to trusting anyone that left your field of view for more than 5 seconds.\nOf wait, you could just have been obliviated.\nExistential dread, much?\nWorse has to be this however:\nWizards tend to generally have not that much of a clue about muggle stuff, but the ministry has to. However, no matter how hard they work, it seems like they will be discovered in just a few decades, maybe one or two hundred years.\nJudging by the state of nonmagical people right now, it’s gonna be war.\nNonmagical comunities will pretty much demand that wizards and witches do their shit for them, since they can break the laws of physics and we, well, can’t.\nSooner or later, there will be threats against them.\nAnd then Muggles will just be wiped of the face of the earth if they start a war. There is no way to win a war against wizards. Even a single one of them could wipe out the entire human civilization. There is nothing you can DO against a teleporting physics breaking monster that you cannot even perceive.\nThat war will be pretty much inevitable with how different a set of value WaW have compared to us. I mean, read above. Everyone will start to blame them and noone will be able to prove or disprove it since technology does not work around magic, so not much chance to build something to detect magic.\nJust imagine the court of law. There would literally only BE wizards viable to judge wizards and you can guess three times where that would would go over with the global population.\nThen the jelousy over their massively longer lifespans. They live for nearly double our life expectation with seemingly no end in sight. There is a wizard that is 755 years old and it is not Nick Flamel.\nThe far worst however, comes to the last:\nTime Travel.\nThe Cursed Child is pretty much the summation of why this is a nightmare in and on itself. Albus just wiped billions of people from existence because he was that much of a stupid little piece of garbage. That is the penultimate nightmare. If even a single villain ever gets his hand on a Super-Time-Turner that is the end. He will be completely unstoppable and some shmuck was capable of making them in his basement, so it is bound to happen again.\nImagine that: As long as a Villain or Madman even has a SINGLE person left that believes in them they are really never truly gone. They might just turn back the pendulum a hundred years and wipe out all the time between to get their “hero” back.",
      "22": "The first book opens with the double murder of a married couple and attempted murder of their one-year old child.\nThe first book ends after Harry kills Quirrel. It was self-defence, of course. But at the tender age of 11, our hero has become a killer. To say nothing of the fact that Quirrel essentially boiled to death.\nHarry Potter didn't ‘get' dark as the books went on. They just got more obvious.",
      "23": "Dumbledore.\nThe man had a one sided attraction to wizard Hitler and possibly killed his own sister. He abandoned his brother after the fact.\nHe lets Sirius take the fall for something EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER knows he would never do (and let's face it, Pettigrew isn't intelligent enough to set up a frame job like that on his own). He had more than enough sway with the government to secure a trial.\nHis hiring choices leave much to be desired, two Death Eaters (one disguised as an unstable, paranoid PTSD-ridden veteran), a werewolf, Voldemort himself, a self absorbed lying actor, an alcoholic Seer with only one known prophecy, a half giant who's been expelled, an old man who just wanted to stay in hiding, and continuing to let a ghost keep teaching a class no one learns anything in.\nHe leaves Harry on a doorstep IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN NOVEMBER. He leaves Harry with the Dursleys at all, against Lily and James’ wishes.\nHe refuses to do anything about the abusive situations both Harry and Riddle are in outside of Hogwarts.\nBlatant manipulation of Harry via praise and rewards, and lessened punishments.

The third floor corridor was out of bounds, punishable by expulsion.\nHe hides the information about the horcruxes, their effects and his own death.\nHe orchestrates his own death via manipulating Snape and Malfoy.\nHe does and allows awful things.",
      "24": "Many things. I can’t really think of and list them all, and even just 57 points took me hours to write.\nVoldemort was almost certainly far more brutal in the First Wizarding War. He may have been more powerful too, as he seemed awfully rusty for the “Most Dangerous Dark Wizard of All Time” in his new body.\nDolores Umbridge almost certainly soul-murdered hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of Muggle-borns from August 1997 to May 1998. This was when Voldemort controlled the Ministry and the Dementor’s Kiss was a possible punishment for resisting arrest.\nThe single worst deed of any character was performed by one of James Potter I’s best friends, that being when Wormtail brought Voldemort back.\nMinister of Magic Cornelius Fudge was arguably even more evil to soul-murder Barty Crouch Jr. than Voldemort was to kill his victims outright.\nHarry lived with a physically violent delinquent until the Dementors mellowed Dudley out.\nPetunia could’ve easily killed Harry if she hit him with the frying pan, although she promised to protect him despite treating him horribly.\nMarge’s dog chased Harry into a tree, and she wouldn’t even call Ripper off until well after midnight.\nA wild animal like a fox, wolf or bear could’ve carried Harry off if Petunia hadn’t arrived first.\nThe Black Lake probably has a tunnel connection with the ocean, as the Giant Squid probably couldn’t live in freshwater.\nSirius tried to choke Harry in the Shrieking Shack. He was really THAT reckless.\nDolores Umbridge actually intended to soul-murder Harry and Dudley with Dementors, and she would’ve probably damaged her soul if she succeeded. See Nathan Beard's answer to Did Umbridge intend to kill Harry with the dementors, and did she know he could conjure a Patronus to save himself if needed?.\nSeverus Snape was physically abused as a child AND mentally tortured as a teenager. It was stated on Wizarding World (formerly Pottermore) that Tobias abused Severus, and there’s almost no way Severus didn’t get stripped naked by Prongs.\nSome of our supposed heroes were much crueler and nastier bullies than the supposedly villainous Draco Malfoy. This included Prongs. Sirius, Fred I and George were even worse than Prongs was, as they were still very cruel but also murderously reckless on top of that.\nRon and Percy were unknowingly sleeping in the same bed as one of the most evil wizards of the age for almost thirteen years, almost every night. Molly, Arthur, Fred I, George, Ginny, Charlie and Bill were also sleeping in the same house as said wizard off and on during that same time.\nNagini - a former human - has been known to eat dead humans.\nAriana may very well have been sexually assaulted, perhaps even raped. See Peter Ramirez's answer to What exactly did the Muggles do to Ariana Dumbledore?.\nAnyone who knew how to cast the Imperius Curse and/or brew a Love Potion could rape whoever they wanted to.\nAnyone who knew how to brew a Love Potion could have as many psychopathic children as they wished.\nNatural-born Legilimens exist, like Queenie Goldstein was. So there are almost certainly other wizards that have peeked into everyone’s minds since they were babies. This would also mean that many of these children have probably seen things so disturbing that even most adults will never have to imagine it.\nIf a Basilisk was set loose uncontrolled, it could kill a whole city pretty quickly.\nFor executions, MACUSA uses a potion so corrosive that it burns through not only humans and soft things, but also some hard things like chairs. Dumping it everywhere on the Muggle world would not only kill every Muggle but could also eliminate any trace of their existence and certain entire species, perhaps even ecosystems. See Death potion\n.\nThere must be extremely strong wards, Muggle-repelling Charms and Disillusionment Charms on all Wizarding locations for them to remain hidden, even with the advanced Muggle technology and some wizards who are discontent with hiding.\nMental health is largely dismissed in Wizarding Britain and Ireland, although we’re not sure about other Wizarding governments.\nThere’s a good chance that once someone gets the Dementor’s Kiss, their soul is trapped inside the Dementor in a sort of hell and/or their body becomes another Dementor. I personally believe both to be true.\nFenrir Greyback was a cannibal and probably a paedophile.\nMaledictuses may well be stuck in their animal form without ageing, as Nagini was at least in her 80s and probably even 90s or 100s when Neville finally killed her. If so, then this means Nagini could’ve been trapped for eternity if not for Neville.\nNagini couldn’t talk, eat human food, wear clothes, live in a house, etc. once she succumbed to her final transformation. Only when she met Voldemort was she finally able to talk to someone who could understand what she said.\nYoung Voldemort and the other Wool’s Orphanage orphans would have lived through the London Blitz and been nearby to experience it. I bet that would’ve been absolutely terrifying, and especially for Voldemort.\nIt’s not known what kind of spell Pandora Lovegood tried to invent, other than that it can kill if it goes wrong. It’s entirely possible that it was a very brutal death, maybe even much worse than Sectumsempra, all happening right in front of her 9-year-old daughter.\nThere are almost certainly all kinds of totally horrific, disturbing spells we never see nor hear about. For example, there may have been spells to rupture someone’s internal organs selectively, draw blood with no wound, squash someone’s skull to crush their brain, etc. that sadists like Bellatrix would’ve enjoyed using.\nThe Horcrux ritual is said to involve something even more disturbing than the soul-damaging murder and soul-splitting end result, so the intermediate phase is clearly something awful.\nIf you tried to summon an astronomical body like a moon, planet, star or solar system, you could well be pulled towards them instead of summoning them. If you somehow weren’t, you’d potentially destroy the entire Earth.\nMost British/Irish Ministry of Magic employees supposedly can’t cast a decent Shield Charm, or at least couldn’t during the Second Wizarding War. If this was so, Death Eaters could’ve easily murdered hundreds of Aurors and high-ranking Ministry officials, which for all we know they probably did.\nAmycus Carrow taught the all-destroying Fiendfyre, which means he probably knew how to properly control it, which in turn means he probably demonstrated it in the classroom.\nIf blood can have immense magical power, it’s entirely possible that other bodily fluids could’ve too. I could imagine spells to enchant one’s saliva to hurt whoever the spitball hit, or to enchant one’s stomach acid to either instantly destroy or completely spare someone, and so much more other potentially difficult to deal with spells.\nAs Shrinking Solution can be reversed and is taught to early Hogwarts students, and there are also Engorgio and Reducio spells, it’s entirely possible that Death Eaters could’ve also shrank their victims and swallowed them whole and alive. This also goes with point #30 to some extent, except it’s less barbaric and could even be performed by many ordinary wizards, maybe even as a “prank gone horribly wrong”.\nIf someone has a House-Elf, they could almost certainly get the House-Elf to commit a murder for them and leave no evidence of damage, given how powerful Elf magic is.\nThe potentially-fatal Unbreakable Vow was supposedly common magical knowledge and easy to perform, as 7-year-old Fred and George Weasley were prepared to use it on 5-year-old Ron.\nIt’s entirely possible that Fred and George Weasley have killed people recklessly and we don’t even know about it. The same could be true of James, Sirius III and even Remus. See also points #36 and #38.\nSeverus Snape probably had to kill at some point to maintain his cover, even though he would’ve felt remorse and thus immediately repaired his damaged soul. The same is probably also true of Draco Malfoy, however horrified by DE activities in general he was.\nGiven what happened to Antioch Peverell, all you need is a knife and an encounter with the right person in their sleep both to commit murder and to master the most powerful wand ever.\nSanta probably has to use Time-Turners and House-Elves to get his job done\n, even though he would be careful to not be seen by his other selves and naturally treat his House-Elves extremely kindly. He’s also almost certainly in possession of the Philosopher’s Stone (or Sorcerer’s Stone), meaning Albus Dumbledore destroying that one Philosopher’s Stone of Nicolas Flamel’s didn’t get rid of every Philosopher’s Stone for good.\nSirius Black III has almost certainly pooped in his dog form many times, as have werewolves in their wolf forms and Wormtail in his rat form. It’s also highly likely that Prongs in his deer form did at some point.\nRodolphus Lestrange managed to escape from Azkaban a third time by 2020, so he was probably an unregistered Animagus. This could be a good exposition for a sequel to the Cursed Child.\nDraco Malfoy was probably suicidal throughout much of the period from September 1996-May 1998, and he may have even continued to be afterwards. His sheer horror at what every other Death Eater was doing would’ve surely taken a toll on him for life, so he may well have become severely, incurably depressed.\nRemus Lupin was probably suicidal many times throughout his life. His sheer self-hatred would’ve surely taken a toll on him for life, so he may well have become severely, incurably depressed.\nHarry Potter was probably severely, incurably depressed after the trauma from the Battle of Hogwarts.\nSeverus Snape almost certainly had severe PTSD. See points #12 and #40.\nHermione trapped a human being in their Animagus form in a glass jar for several days in a row, which is arguably worse than simply torturing and/or imprisoning someone. It’s barbaric. This also has disgusting implications, mentioned in point #43.\nWrackspurts could very well be actual magical microorganisms with powers similar to the spell Legilimens at high concentrations, rather than simply made up by Luna. If this is true, Harry was probably still having nightmares between 1998 and 2020, although less vivid and frequent. Even Occlumency wouldn’t stop someone from having nightmares because of Wrackspurts (Occlumency wouldn’t be applicable during sleep), so it’s likely that even known Occlumens like Severus Snape, Albus Dumbledore and Draco Malfoy would’ve had truly awful nightmares by adulthood if they were sufficiently traumatized (which in those cases, they were).\nVoldemort enjoyed mental torture more than physical and was supposedly the best Legilimens out there, so the visions he could’ve produced in his victims could’ve been 100% disturbing. He could’ve possibly even driven them insane like the Longbottoms and only finally killed them then. I could imagine things like inflicting visions of his horrid future state in Limbo upon the victim, forcing them to witness the Horcrux ritual (see point #31), producing monstrous noises and light shows that would give almost any epileptic or autistic person a seizure and even forcing them to falsely experience being in the middle of the London Blitz, Hiroshima explosion, Holocaust, etc. He could’ve even come up with things unimaginably worse than that.\nHarry accidentally and unknowingly Apparated when he was only a single-digit age, not even getting splinched in the process.\nIt’s likely that more people than Herpo the Foul and Voldemort created Horcruxes without us knowing, given that Owle Bullock was able to write a detailed book about Horcrux creation and destruction. There’s also the fact that Raczidian was supposedly devoured by maggots for casting Expecto Patronum while not being “pure of heart”, even though Dolores Umbridge could cast one at a time that her soul was almost certainly damaged (see point #2).\nVoldemort probably unknowingly, wandlessly and non-verbally used the Imperius Curse and Legilimens on Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop. He probably also inflicted a disturbing vision even we could hardly imagine on them; see point #51.\nIf Avada Kedavra is capable of killing absolutely any living thing, then using it on even what appears to be a tiny little seedling could potentially kill a whole forest, savanna, shrubland or grassland if it’s a species that produces plant runners; it would kill the entire root system. If it also leaves no trace of bodily damage as with animals, then someone could go and kill your plants and you might not know for a while; quite possibly even months or years if it’s a plant with tough evergreen leaves like most conifers, some hollies, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms or some camellias.\nThere were almost certainly wizards with OCD, ADHD, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, etc., and they were almost certainly bullied for it not only in the Muggle world but the Wizarding World too; also see point #23. Also, it’s highly unlikely that magic could cure them, as they aren’t diseases/injuries and are something you’re born with (I was born with autism, OCD and ADHD, and I was bullied for my autism). Combine this with the lack of mental health facilities in Wizarding Britain/Ireland, and you have a strong likelihood that these unfortunate people were being bullied horribly, even when you consider that many autistic people would probably get high marks on their O.W.L.s and even N.E.W.T.s.\nDementors were supposedly the least horrific thing found when Azkaban was discovered by the British Ministry of Magic.",
      "25": "Morality of the Wizarding World is very fucked-up.\nRemember Dobby, the house-elf:\nHe badly pounds himself every time he thinks he is remotely doing anything against his master’s wishes. He has been mentally tormented to the extent that he has internalized his serfdom and slavery.\nEven though, house-elves are shown to be sentient-beings with fully-realized feelings, wizards never look at them and ponder, ‘Hmm… what we are doing seems a lot like slavery, and even muggles figured out slavery is bad, like hundred years ago.’\nEven Dumbledore, a grand man, full of great wisdom and compassion doesn’t seem to recoil at the plight of elves.",
      "26": "When Voldemort comes back from Albania he is in the body of a baby, which looks so horrible that war veteran Frank Bryce screams in horror at the sight of it.\n\"It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone, and revealed something ugly, slimy and blind — but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face — no child alive ever had a face like that — was flat and snake-like, with gleaming red eyes.”\nWhere did he get that body from? The only thing that’s mentioned in the books is that Voldemort used “a few dark spells of [his] own invention” and a potion made from unicorn blood and venom from Nagini. It’s of course possible that this created a kind of vessel for him to attach his soul to (even Fullmetal Alchemist states that the ingredients to make a human body are cheap; it’s the soul binding that will cost you). Still, there might be something more, because JKR has stated that one of the things she will never reveal is how Voldermort made his rudimentary body, as the process is too horrible. This has, of course, caused fans to speculate, and one of the most popular theories is that Voldemort possessed a fetus in Bertha Jorkins, and that became the “frame” of his horrible baby body.",
      "27": "The fact that Hogwarts is very, very dangerous.\n“First-years, please do not enter the Forbidden Forest, or else you’ll get detention and your punishment is to go into the Forbidden Forest, even if we know that it is Forbidden for a reason, we’ll let you go in there because it’s for educational purposes. Oh, and you will be split up to add more danger, too!”\n“Oh no, people are getting petrified, what shall we do? Well, not close the school, not yet, we need to send a famous faker that keeps bossing us around for the mission and we clearly know he will not get the job done, just to get rid of him. So, someone was possessed for an entire school year? Oh, not to worry, shove her a warm chocolate and she’ll be good to go, no need for help or anything at all. Also, you didn’t learn anything anyway, so all exams are cancelled!”\n“A mass murderer escaped? We’ll guard Hogwarts with Dementors, which will clearly risk sucking souls out of students if they decided to go outside. But we’ll still let them go to Hogsmeade even if the murderer could be lurking in there, and we’ll completely ignore the fact that some stupid man made an excuse to execute Buckbeak (Except Dumbledore). Also, we’ll allow monster books!”\n“So someone underaged entered the tournament, eh? Well, we’ll let him get chased by dragons, get drowned in the lake and completely overlook the portkey in the maze which someone will use to end his childhood! And while all that we just sit on the wooden benches and wait. And there is an imposter teacher too? Blimey, DADA teachers are sure to be running out…Ooh, yes, I remember hearing the imposter teaching how to kill at some point.”\n“Someone (hem, hem) is in the castle and is so visibly making Hogwarts hell? Do nothing, that’s the answer! And leave the castle unprotected while the Headmaster fled, let’s torture students and force the truth out of them which is apparently illegal!\n“Oh dear! Someone in the school’s a Death Eater who’s trying desperately to kill someone by creeping in cursing objects, and no one tries to find out who! Oh, poison? Whatever, we’ve treated vanished bones anyway.”\nThat pretty much sums it all up.",
      "28": "One, the contempt for muggles. Pureblood arrogance is one thing because bigots are bigots and you don't expect better from them. On the other hand, Hagrid called Harry's terrified relatives the most muggle muggles he’d ever seen and freely hexed a child who hadn't even spoken because he didn't like his father.\nDumbledore was willing to threaten them while offering no help or advice on raising a magical child.\nThere's a whole department devoted to misused muggle objects and at least some of the people dealing with them can't name muggle artifacts properly (sorry, Arthur. Learn the lingo.).\nThen there's the lack of human rights, setting aside the acceptance of elf slavery. Azkaban is designed to destroy the prisoner, not reform them. Their soul can be fed to a monster, but trials don't always happen. Remember how they intended to deal with Sirius Black? Escaping earned him a death sentence.\nBarty Crouch was given the same sentence, arbitrarily carried out without questioning him.\nThe wizarding government seems pretty corrupt (Death Eaters used the Imperius defense and apparently a bribe was enough for them to be believed). At the end of the series, the good guys “won”, but remember that they were defending the status quo. The time skip showed their families sending their children off to Hogwarts, good guys and surviving bad, without any hint that society's changed at all. I find that it felt like a hint that the cycle, with another Dark Lord or Lady in another generation or so, is bound inevitably to continue.\nTell me that ain’t dark.",
      "29": "To me, it’s the central theme:\nThat a boy who is barely a teenager is told by everyone around him that he is the only thing standing between good and evil, and failure will mean not only his death, but the death of the nonevil portion of the wizard world.\nThat kind of gets glossed over, I think. Harry goes through a lot of dangerous tests and adventures, some of which cause him great emotional and physical pain. He is basically expected to accept that he could die or fail without flinching. He is expected to be prepared to fight the most powerful evil figures in the wizarding world by the adults around him. Those adults at times in their zeal to get Harry prepared seem to forget Harry is only a boy—he is lectured, pressured to endure training and to learn fast, and at times his mentors and supposed protectors push him to the breaking point. There are few instances in the book where his mentors appear to have any sympathy for him when he fails to meet their standards.\nAnd now as a preteen/early teenager, the wizarding world looks to him to save them.\nA twelve-thirteen year old boy. A boy who is forced to grow up too soon with no regard for what all those expectations are doing to his mental or physical condition.\nHarry’s whole life is pretty dark. He isn’t allowed to be a child. He has already grown up unloved by his relatives who make it very clear he is unwanted. He was an orphan pretty much from birth, he never really knew his parents. He isn’t allowed any kind of normalcy, he is constantly reminded that he cannot be like the other kids. He has to be brave and stoic beyond his years. He has to be smarter than an evil grown man and his henchmen/henchwomen who have years on him as far as powers and cleverness, or he will lose his life and the wizarding world will suffer.\nHarry cannot be a kid.\nIf that isn’t dark, I don’t know what is.",
      "30": "The wizard criminal justice system is fucked up. As in, China, Russia, and the U.S.A would say “isn`t that a bit much?” So, wizard criminals get sent to Azkaban, an isolated fortress guarded by miserable beings that suck the joy and life out of the surrounding environment, when they`re not literally sucking out someone`s soul. Just give me the firing squad already. Not only is that legal, it`s not even questioned by anyone, even Dumbledore, Hermione, or Harry, the official SJWs of the books. Also, wizards do not have fair trials, or at least not during the post-Voldemort days. Barty Crouch sent his own son to prison, just because Igor Karkaroff said he was a Death Eater, and the dude didn`t even get to be represented in court. Karkaroff was on trial, you know he would say anything to get off. Crouch, Jr. was a piece of shit, but still. Not to mention this was before the government got all corrupt in the 5th book, and openly anti-Muggle in the 7th. So, that`s where we draw the line, not at people just getting sent to prison without counsel to go insane from being around dementors.\nI guess this isn`t completely ignored, since it`s kind of implied that Sirius was mentally shaken from his 13 years in Azkaban, but there was never a sit-down conversation about it. That`s a pretty inhumane thing to let slide, guys….",
      "31": "The missing Horcrux.\nAlthough The Dark Lord is thought to be dead, there is actually an eighth Horcrux which Harry and his friends — and even Dumbledore himself — have totally missed.

      "32": "What is something that is really dark in the Harry Potter series that is really just kind of ignored?\nLOVE POTIONS\nLove potions, for the most part, aren’t really addressed all that seriously, except the incident in which Ron stuffs himself on love potion-spiked chocolates that had been given to Harry, which is played for laughs(and serves to set up the later, much less funny incident where Ron is accidentally nearly poisoned to death).\nThey’re sold over the counter in joke shops like Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, can be brewed at home, and are apparently entirely unregulated. The only other known possible incident of a love potion being used is, of course, the incident with Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle, in which it is speculated that Merope slipped Tom Riddle a love potion, causing him to elope with her, then later abandon her.\nBut the story never really implies that there’s anything particularly dark about love potions in and of themselves, and yet they are. Because love potions, essentially, are foolproof, legal date-rape drugs.\nIn the real world, the kind of stunt pulled by Merope Gaunt on Tom Riddle or Romilda Vane on Ron(though Harry was the intended target) is a FELONY. Actually, in the case of Merope Gaunt, probably multiple felonies.\nImagine if you could walk into a convenience store and pick up Rohypnol or GHB over the counter, no questions asked. That’s the Magical world of Harry Potter. Yet nobody seems to particularly care - Merope is painted as a tragic victim of her circumstances, and as I mentioned above, the Ron incident is mostly played for laughs.\nThat kind of disgusts me.",
      "33": "In the Harry Potter series, there are several dark and disturbing elements that are explored to varying degrees. However, one aspect that is often overlooked or downplayed is the use of memory modification or erasure, specifically through the spell known as Obliviate.\nObliviate is a powerful charm used to erase memories from a person's mind. It is primarily used by the wizarding community to maintain secrecy and cover up any magical occurrences witnessed by Muggles (non-magical people). While it is portrayed as a necessary tool for protecting the wizarding world, the implications of memory modification can be quite troubling.\nThe use of Obliviate raises ethical questions about consent and the violation of personal autonomy. In the series, characters such as Gilderoy Lockhart and Newt Scamander are shown using Obliviate to erase memories, often without the knowledge or consent of those affected. This raises issues of erasing someone's experiences and potentially altering their sense of identity.\nAdditionally, the long-term effects of memory modification are not thoroughly explored in the series. The erasure of memories can lead to significant psychological trauma for both the person whose memories are erased and those who perform the spell. It is mentioned that repeated use of Obliviate can cause damage to a witch or wizard's mind, yet this aspect is not deeply examined.\nFurthermore, Obliviate is sometimes used as a means of avoiding accountability or evading responsibility. It allows individuals to erase their own mistakes or wrongdoings from the memories of others, effectively escaping consequences for their actions. This aspect highlights the potential for abuse and manipulation that comes with such a powerful spell.\nWhile the use of Obliviate serves as a plot device and adds complexity to the wizarding world, its implications raise thought-provoking questions about the ethics of memory modification and the consequences it can have on individuals and society as a whole",

      "37": "Snape’s childhood. I know we don’t get much information about his childhood, but we know he had an abusive muggle father that shaped him into who he was.\nSnape is often viewed through rose colored glasses where he is this tragically misunderstood good guy who did everything out of love for Lily; with his famous word “always,” one of the most overused overhyped symbols of love in all of fiction. But let’s take off those rose tinted glasses, and look at the facts.\nFact: Snape has an abusive father.\nThis likely led to his obsession with the dark arts; as he probably fantasized about using dark magic to rid him and his mother of his father’s abuse.\nHis abusive father is also why Snape was never able to form healthy attachments to people. Lily as we know was unwaveringly kind. Her and Snape met as kids, and she was probably the first friend he ever made. Because she was so nice to him it led to Snape forming an unhealthy attachment to her (aka an obsession).\nThis also led to another internal conflict. Thanks to his father Snape hated muggles. He joined like-minded muggle haters called Death Eaters where his ideas were cemented and expanded. In his mind all muggles and muggle borns were evil like his father. He was convinced that Lily was an exception to the rule. (Most people have heard of a racist person that says “except you. You’re not like other blacks.)\nWhile many people believe he does everything out of love for Lily anyone who knows how love works understands there’s no way Snape loves her. If you love someone you don’t join a hate group that specifically targets the person you claim to love. That’s like someone in love with a Jewish girl joining a neo-Nazi group. He didn’t love Lily he just had an unhealthy attachment to her, which led to his fighting with James, because he didn’t want James taking his property.\nThe same tattered relationship with his father led to his lifelong hate of James and Sirius and anyone associated with them. Like his dad James and Sirius didn’t respect him, and thought they were better than him. They abused him and embarrassed him, and like his father he would never forgive them for what they did. Anyone who associated with them would be guilty by association.\nAlso because of his father he never could trust people. His life experiences compounded on this. He thought he could trust Voldemort, but Voldemort betrayed him and killed Lily. He thought he could trust Dumbledore, but Dumbledore failed to protect Lily. That’s why he spends the whole series questioning every decision Dumbledore makes; from hiring Lupin to making Snape kill him.\nThe key to Snape’s broken mind can be found in two ways. 1 how he treats children. No well adjusted person can be cruel and spiteful to innocent children. 2 how he never got over Lily. Imagine if a grow man tells you, “I’m madly in love with this dead girl. We were friends when we were kids, but when we were teenagers she stopped hanging out with me since I joined a racist gang. She ended up marrying this guy I absolutely hate that I used ...",
      "38": "That Dumbledore knowingly left Harry with abusive relatives. The family treated Harry like a slave and deprived him of any shred of love and care. He was beaten and mistreated by his so-called relatives and Dumbledore never made a move. It wasn't even clear if he checked up on Harry until his 11th birthday\nSure, you could make the point that Lily's charm works and will protect Harry against Voldemort. However, Albus Dumbledore is literally the most powerful wizard alive at that time wielding the most powerful wand. It is also noted that he was the only one that Voldemort was afraid of.\nYou can't tell me that he couldn't have protected Harry. It was 11 years that he let this boy be stuck in an abusive home and would send him back every year until he was 17.\nThat's just plain dark.",
      "39": "A lot of the answers cover the darker aspects of the series, especially Nathan Beard’s answer and I don’t know how I can follow that. But let’s see what I can come up with.\nIn previous answers of mine, I have argued how, through his actions and Rowling’s own words, Grindelwald is the true wizarding equivalent of Hitler. I think the evidence solidly backs that up. However, the obsessional beliefs surrounding blood purity by many, especially the Death Eaters, is sort of glossed over. Yet when you really think about it, it’s downright terrifying. In this aspect, Voldemort and his followers mirror these beliefs.\nThe Gaunts.\nMarvolo, Morfin, and Merope are the last surviving pureblood descendants of Slytherin.\n\"Marvolo\n, his son, Morfin\n, and his daughter, Merope\n, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.\" (HBP)\nFrom the limited data we’re given about these three, it is clear that they are not completely mentally healthy. They kept to themselves, having lost all of their fortune years before. Marvolo was abusive, especially towards Merope, preventing her from being able to use her magic. Merope then goes on to drug, rape, and continue to control a man she was obsessed with for years. Their ancestors weren’t all that better (as House of Gaunt\npage goes into).\nThe obsession this family had with maintaining their blood status causes the development of mental instability, abuse, rape, and all around crazy. Yes, this family was seen as outsiders even within the Pureblood community, but the idea of keeping their blood status still remains.\nThe Blacks.\nYeah, this family is crazy. They disown members who don’t uphold the family values of purity (Sirius, Andromeda) and adhere to ancient practices, such as close marriage and the practice of owning house elves. Their family motto - Toujours Pur - demonstrates this as well. Sirius mentioned that his parents were never actually Death Eaters, but without fail, they still supported those beliefs. One of their members attempted to make a Muggle hunting bill legal. They saw themselves as royalty and were willing to do anything to maintain that.\nSacred Twenty-Eight\nThis is a list of families that were considered to be pureblood by/in the 1930s. If you were to take a look at the names, at least 20 of the 28 families have connections to the Dark Arts, whether that be to Voldemort or even Grindelwald. We know that Voldemort had a significant number of followers but these are the names of his inner circle. Those same families have power in wide range of position in the Ministry of Magic.\nYou might be saying, hold on. We all know that these people are crazy, that their beliefs aren’t the same that we have, that we know that marrying cousins and hunting Muggles is bad. But really think about it. How much does Rowling condemn their beliefs? She glosses over the fact that Merope used a date rape drug, she skims over how families disown their children for negligible reasons, she ignores what the Weasleys and Prewetts must have practiced in order to maintain their blood purity.\nLet’s talk about the Weasleys. They are able to maintain their status of being pureblood (Molly being a Prewett). They obviously don’t support the Death Eaters. Yet some of their statements are semi concerning. Knowing that red hair is a recessive trait, these two families must have had to intermarry in order to maintain their status. They clearly loved Harry and Hermione, regardless of their blood status. However, Ron mentions offhand that one of their cousins is a Squib, yet they never have any contact with him. They are seen as outcasts by the majority of other purebloods, but regardless of that, they still are. Yes, Harry’s generation ends the pureblood line and they do everything they can to fight against Voldemort. (Don’t get me wrong, I love the Weasleys.)\nBut most importantly, Rowling fails to discuss how much influence these families truly have. Muggle born or even half blood children at Hogwarts are bullied. Squibs are seen as even less than that. Children like Neville are seen as a disgrace to being pureblood if they are unable to maintain a level of powerful magic. Being pureblood and the power that comes along with that permeates the entire wizarding world. Rowling tries to argue that it’s okay to not be - and makes a valid attempt to. Yet to make “the brightest witches” both Muggle borns appears to simply cast more diversity, to attempt to lessen the power of the purebloods. I think we all know that these pureblood families are twisted and their beliefs are wrong. But I think we overlook just how powerful they all are and how their beliefs affect nearly every aspect of the wizarding community.",

To erase someone's memories is to erase who they are. To deprive someone of their own free will, their personality, their sense of self.\nThe whole Obliviate thing, remember that it is supposed to be white magic, good magic, is as dark as it can get.",
      "41": "That Harry is equally, if not more abusive to the Dursleys, than they are to Harry.\nNow I’ve only read the books ages ago and I don’t remember them, so I’ll be talking about what I saw in the movies.\nEverybody agrees that the Dursleys are mean, abusive parents, than no child should have growing up. I agree with that. But because Harry is the main protagonist of the show, everybody also ignores of how abusive Harry is to this “muggle” family.\nLet’s start with movie 1 and look at things from the Dursleys perspective:\nImagine you’re sitting at home, and suddenly there is a baby at your door step. Do you have to take it in and adopt it? No. That is not your responsibility, you can bring it to a foster home, or try finding someone else to keep the baby. Hey, if you’re evil, you can just abandon it. The Dursleys don’t do any of that and they take it in, because it’s the child of the mother’s sister, and even though they didn’t like each other, they still keep the child left at the door step.\nNow, fast forward untill year 1 of school, as we don’t see how Harry grows up.\nThe Dursleys kid, Dudley, is having a birthday party. They go to the zoo, to spend some quality family time together. The father tells Harry to not do any pranks. Guess what, the moment the father looks away from his son, as he turns back, he sees him trapped in a snake pit, behind the glass. Then he looks at Harry, who is laughing about this event. What a wonderful birthday present!\nNow, tell me, would you honestly believe, that Harry did not intentionally trap Dudley in a snake pit, when you see him laughing, and defying the order to not do any pranks? Why do you think Vernon gave this order? I think, it’s because stuff like this had been happening for all of their life, since they took Harry in, and this is definetely not the first time.\nNow let’s go to year 2. Another encounter with the day of Harry and the Dursley family. Guess what’s gonna happen? Will harry prank them again, or I don’t know, maybe throw a cake on a guest during an important meeting? BINGO, we have a winner! You just cost your muggle father a promotion, or perhaps even a job.\nNow, I know, that Harry did not intentionally drop a cake on a guest, he even tried to prevent that from happening, but remember, we are looking at this from the Dursley’s perspective. They did not see an elf. They don’t know it was there. All they saw is Harry, right next to the guest, with arms wide open, as if he was carrying the cake. If I was Vernon, I would totally assume Harry did this. After all, things like this have been happening every time we see them together in the movie. So from this, we can possibly conclude that this happens on a daily basis. This is likely the reason, why Harry is locked up in a small room, under the stairs. Every time he seems to get out, pranks happen.\nAnd don’t even get me going on year 3. Dude straight up uses magic in the house, to lighten up his book with Lumos, because he wants to read it at the middle of the night, instead of waiting for the day. The result? He keeps waking everyone up, and stressing them out. Those people have jobs man. Oh, and guess what. He straight up sends another guest flying like a baloon. I don’t even know if they survived. So did Harry literally kill his guest in year 3, or are we just going to brush it off, as he’s the main protagnist and the guest was being mean to him, so he can do whatever he wants.\nJudging from all the encounters we see with Dursleys and Harry, it clearly looks that Harry is intentionally pranking, or even abusing them.\n*Edit* Perhaps I wasn’t fully clear. What I wanted to say is that it LOOKS like Harry is abusing the Dursleys from THEIR perspective and theirs only. Harry doesn’t actually abuse anyone, and all the events that happen are accidental. Think of Harry as a cursed kid, that tries to just live his life, and without his control he ends up doing things that appear to be abusive. For example, the zoo and trapping the kid in the pit. It LOOKS abusive from Dursleys perspective because Harry is laughing about it and their beloved son is trapped in danger, but from Harry’s perspective it was a complete accident, where he had no control over it. Harry gets blamed, because the Dursleys think Harry abused them intentionally, even though that is not true.",
      "42": "Polyjuice potion\nA potion that Allows a human drinker to temporarily assume the form of another person.\nMost notably used during the battle of the seven potters.\nThough, the idea of transforming into another person might seem fun, people fail to think of the very dark side and privacy risks.\nThe real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own.\nEven Harry was disturbed with the way his body was being displayed by his friends.

They’re not even bothered by it.\nKeep in mind that this is a magical society where magic takes care of virtually every single kind of chore that you might care about, if you want it to. You can use magic to cook food, to travel, to generate clothing, appearances, clean (as we see Dumbledore and Slughorn do in his house), observe, basically anything. Owning slaves isn’t a necessity; it’s an affectation. It’s something you do simply to show your worth.\nAnd who owns slaves? The most evil old pureblood houses…and Hogwarts.",
      "49": "Everyone focuses on Harry’s issues in the wizard world, but everyone overlooks how he was emotionally abused by the Dursley’s for his entire childhood. They only gave him what he would need to survive, what they would legally have to give him as guardians. In the real world, the kind of treatment he received would easily be considered trauma and emotional abuse, but everyone overlooks it because of the other things in Harry’s life. Yes, Voldemort and all that was awful, but the Dursley’s were supposed to be his family, and their home was supposed to be the safest place he could stay. But he was never very safe there.\nOn top of this, no one in the books themselves really cared. When Dumbledore said he was going to leave Harry there (despite knowing literally nothing about them), McGonagall begged him not to because after observing the Dursley’s for only a day she knew it was a horrible home for Harry. Instead of listening to her logical reasoning, Dumbledore sat down and started eating lemon drops, saying he thought anything was better than Harry growing up famous. So he made him the victim of years of emotional trauma just to avoid the same amount of fame he would have to face in 10 years anyway. If anything it made him more unprepared, but Dumbledore just really didn’t seem to care at the time (check the first chapter of the first book).",
      "50": "A dark thing I noticed in Harry Potter, is that there is a lot of abuse.\nHarry himself: Being negligent is a type of abuse.\nSeverus: was emotionally and physically neglected and repeatedly beaten by his father.\nMerope Gaunt: physically, emotionally, and maybe even sexually abused by her brother and father.\nTom Riddle Sr: Sexually abused.\nRon: neglected by Molly.\nNeville: not really abuse, so to speak, but it’s not responsible to hold an eight-year-old out a window.\nSo, as you can see, Harry Potter is pretty dark things."

Before the civil war, there was a Political Consultative Conference held by all poltical parties at that time to discuss peaceful plan to construct the country. Acutally, KMT and CPC reached the agreement that ROC would adopt parliamentary system afterwards and among 1800 members of the congress, other parties even agree that KMT could reserve 240 non-elected seats.

If Chiang does not have the support of the people, no matter how many advanced weapons he possesses, it will be of no use. Mao once helped Chiang point out the problems of the Kuomintang:\nLet the whole nation denounce the Wang Ching-weis. Now that the traitor Wang Ching-wei has gathered his gang together, betrayed his country, attached himself to the enemy and signed traitorous secret pacts, playing the jackal to the tiger, all our countrymen demand his death. But this only takes care of the open Wang Ching-weis and leaves out the undercover ones. The latter are either craftily seizing key posts and swaggering about, or working obscurely and worming their way into all walks of life. In effect, the corrupt officials are part of the Wang Ching-wei gang and all the friction-mongers are its underlings. Unless there is a national campaign to denounce the Wang Ching-weis, a campaign in town and country and from top to bottom in which everyone is mobilized, including all political parties, government organs, armed forces, civilian bodies, the press and the educational institutions, the Wang Ching-wei gang will never be eradicated but will persist in its nefarious activities, doing incalculable damage by opening the door to the enemy from without and by subversion from within. The government should issue a decree calling on the whole people to repudiate the Wang Ching-weis. Wherever the decree is not carried out, the officials should be called to account. The Wang Ching-wei gang must be extirpated. This is the first point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nStrengthen unity. Nowadays some people talk not of unity but of unification, and the implication is that unification means nothing short of liquidating the Communist Party, disbanding the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, abolishing the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and demolishing the anti-Japanese forces everywhere. What this kind of talk ignores is the fact that the Communist Party, the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region are the staunchest advocates of unification in all China. Was it not they who recommended the peaceful settlement of the Sian Incident? Is it not they who have initiated the Anti-Japanese National United Front, proposed a unified democratic republic and worked really hard for both? Is it not they who are standing at the forefront of the nation's defences, resisting seventeen enemy divisions, shielding the Central Plains and the Northwest and defending northern China and the regions south of the lower Yangtse, and resolutely applying the Three People's Principles and the Programme of Armed Resistance and National Reconstruction? Yet the moment Wang Ching-wei openly came out against the Communists and sided with the Japanese, sorcerers like Chang Chun-mai and Yeh Ching chimed in with tendentious articles, and the anti-Communist and die-hard cliques joined in by stirring up \"friction\". Autocratic rule has been imposed in the name of unification. The principle of unity has been discarded and the thin end of the wedge of disruption driven in. This Szuma Chao trick is obvious to every man in the street. The Communist Party, the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the Border Region stand firmly for genuine and against sham unification, for rational and against irrational unification, and for unification in substance and against unification in form. They advocate unification for resistance and not for capitulation, for unity and not for division, for progress and not for retrogression. Unification on the basis of these three--resistance, unity and progress--is genuine, rational and real unification. To seek unification on any other basis, whatever intrigues or tricks are used, is like \"going south by driving the chariot north\"; with that we beg to disagree. All the local anti-Japanese forces should be looked after equally well, without discriminating against some and favouring others; all of them should be trusted, provisioned, supported, and encouraged with rewards. There should be sincerity and not hypocrisy, large-mindedness and not pettiness, in dealing with people. If things are really done in this way, all except those with ulterior motives will unite and take the road of national unification. It is an unalterable truth that unification must be based on unity and unity in its turn must be based on progress, and that only progress can bring unity and only unity can bring unification. This is the second point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nPut constitutional government into effect.. The long years of \"political tutelage\" have yielded nothing. \"A thing turns into its opposite if pushed too far\"; hence constitutional government is now on the order of the day. There is still no freedom of speech, the ban on political parties has not been lifted, and constitutionalism is violated everywhere. If the constitution is drawn up on these lines, it will be a mere scrap of official paper. Such constitutionalism will be no different from one-party dictatorship. Now that there is a profound national crisis, with the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei harassing us from without and the traitors disrupting us from within, our existence as a nation and people will be placed in jeopardy unless there is a change of policy. The government should immediately lift the ban on the political parties and encourage freedom of opinion to show that it sincerely intends to put constitutionalism into practice. Nothing is more urgent for winning the full confidence of the people and shaping the destiny of the nation anew. This is the third point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nPut an end to the \"friction\". Since the \"Measures for Restricting the Activities of Alien Parties\" were introduced in March last year, the clamour for \"restricting\", \"corroding\" and \"combating\" the Communist Party has reverberated throughout the country, there has been one tragic incident after another, and blood has flown freely. As if this were not enough, the additional \"Measures for Dealing with the Alien Party Problem\" were introduced in October last year. Then there are the \"Directives for Dealing with the Alien Party Problem\" in northwestern, northern and central China. People have been saying, and quite justifiably, that \"political restriction\" of the Communist Party has been succeeded by \"military restriction\". In fact, restricting Communism equals anti-communism. And anti-communism is the cunning and pernicious scheme used by the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei for subjugating China. That is why the people are suspicious and shocked and are telling one another about it, and are afraid that the bitter tragedy of a decade ago is being re-enacted. Matters have gone far enough, with the Pingkiang Massacre in Hunan, the Chuehshan Massacre in Honan, the attack on the Eighth Route Army by Chang Yin-wu in Hopei, the attack on the guerrillas by Chin Chi-jung in Shantung, the ruthless slaughter of between five and six hundred Communists by Cheng Ju-huai in eastern Hupeh, the large-scale assaults on the garrison forces of the Eighth Route Army by the Central Army in eastern Kansu and, more recently, the tragedy in Shansi where the old army attacked the new army and invaded positions held by the Eighth Route Army. If such incidents are not immediately prohibited, both sides will be doomed, and what hope will there be then of victory over Japan? For the sake of unity in the War of Resistance, the government should order the punishment of all the perpetrators of these massacres and announce to the whole nation that no such incident will be allowed to recur. This is the fourth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nProtect the youth. Concentration camps have recently been set up near Sian, and people have been horrified to learn that more than seven hundred progressive young people from the northwestern and central provinces have already been interned there, subjected to mental and physical bondage and treated like convicts. What crime have they committed to deserve such cruelty? Young people are the cream of the nation, and the progressive ones in particular are our most precious asset in the War of Resistance. Everyone should enjoy freedom of belief; ideas can never be suppressed by force of arms. The crime of the ten years of \"cultural suppression\" is known to everyone; why should anyone desire to repeat it today? The government should immediately issue a nation-wide order for the protection of youth, for the abolition of the concentration camps near Sian and for the strict prohibition of the outrageous attacks on young people in various places. This is the fifth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nSupport the front. Troops who are fighting in the very front line and with fine records of service, such as the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and certain other units, are receiving the worst treatment; they are thinly clad, badly fed and kept short of ammunition and medicines. Yet unscrupulous traitors are allowed to slander them. There is a deafening din of countless absurd slanders against them. Merit goes unrewarded and distinguished service uncited, while false charges and malicious plots become more and more brazen. This fantastic state of affairs dampens the ardour of our officers and men and wins applause only from the enemy; on no account must it be allowed to continue. To lift up the hearts of the troops and so help the war, the government should adequately provision the front-line troops who have good service records and at the same time strictly prohibit the treacherous slanders and accusations against them. This is the sixth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nProscribe the secret service. People are comparing the secret service agents to Chou Hsing and Lai Chun-chen of the Tang Dynasty and Wei Chung-hsien and Liu Chin of the Ming Dynasty because of their lawlessness and violence. Ignoring the enemy and concentrating on our own countrymen, they are committing innumerable murders and insatiably taking bribes; in fact the secret service is the headquarters of the rumour-mongers and a breeding ground of treason and evil. Ordinary people everywhere recoil and turn away in fear from these fiendish brutes of agents. To preserve its own prestige, the government should immediately proscribe these activities of the secret service and reorganize it, defining its duties as exclusively directed against the enemy and the traitors, so that the people's confidence may be restored and the foundations of the state strengthened. This is the seventh point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nDismiss corrupt officials. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, there have been cases of officials netting up to 100 million yuan out of the national crisis and taking as many as eight or nine concubines. Conscription, government bonds, economic controls, famine relief and war relief, all without exception have become money-making opportunities for corrupt officials. With such a pack of wolves running wild, no wonder the country's affairs are in chaos. The people are seething with discontent and anger, yet none dare expose the ruthlessness of these officials. To save the country from collapse, drastic and effective steps should immediately be taken to clear out all corrupt officials. This is the eighth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nPut the Testament of Dr. Sun Yat-sen into effect. The Testament says: For forty years I have devoted myself to the cause of the national revolution with the aim of winning freedom and equality for China. My experiences during these forty years have firmly convinced me that to achieve this aim we must arouse the masses of the people.... A most remarkable statement indeed, and we the 450 million people of China are all familiar with it. But the Testament is more often chanted than carried out. Desecrators of the Testament are rewarded while those who honour it in their acts are punished. What could be more preposterous? The government should decree that anyone who dares to violate the Testament and who tramples on the masses of the people instead of arousing them will be punished for profaning Dr. Sun Yat-sen's memory. This is the ninth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.\nPut the Three People's Principles into effect. The Three People's Principles are the platform of the Kuomintang. Yet many people, making anti-communism their first duty, are giving up the war effort and doing everything possible to suppress and hold back the people as they rise to resist Japan, which is tantamount to abandoning the Principle of Nationalism; officials are depriving the people of all democratic rights, which is tantamount to abandoning the Principle of Democracy; they are ignoring the people's sufferings, which is tantamount to abandoning the Principle of the People's Livelihood. Such persons pay only lip-service to the Three People's Principles and either ridicule those who seriously try to put them into effect as busy-bodies or severely punish them. Thus, all sorts of fantastic abuses have sprung up and the government's prestige has reached rock bottom. An unequivocal order should immediately be issued for the strict carrying out of the Three People's Principles throughout the country. Those who violate the order should be severely punished and all who carry it out amply encouraged. It is only in this way that the Three People's Principles can at long last be put into effect and the foundations laid for victory in the war. This is the tenth point which we urge you to accept and act upon.",

      "40": "This monster getting caught finally!\nFor all those who do not know, Yaser Abdel Said is a fugitive who has been on the run from the law for 12 years. It has been so long that when he committed the crime I was less than half my age today, but I can still remember being very unsettled when I saw his story long back on America’s Most Wanted.\nWarning: Below Content may be disturbing. Reader Discretion is advised.\nHis story was so horrendous and many for many due to the nature of the story. Due to the nature of the crime, he was placed on the FBI’s top 10 most wanted list and even placed in the ‘dirty dozen list’ of America's Most Wanted.\nThe story:\nYaser was a radical Islamic extremist who was born in Egypt but later immigrated to Dallas, Texas, US. He worked mostly menial jobs in the US.\nHe met a teenager in 1987, Patricia Owens who was 15 at that time. They ended up getting married after only 2 weeks of dating when she was a minor of 15 years and he was 30 years old.\nIn the next 3 years, before she turned 18 she gave birth to three children in 3 consecutive years: Her son Islam and two daughters Amina and Sarah respectively.\nYaser with his family\nYaser was very controlling and abusive with Patricia. He treated her very bad and she finally had it enough and left him in 1997. He did not take kindly to this act.\nAs a way of retaliation and to manipulate her into submission, he picked up the children that day from school and drove them off. He called her to convey that he would be leaving with them to the Middle East and she would never see them again. She gave in to his demands and reconciled with him due to the fear of not seeing her children ever again.\nNext year, during October 1998, the story took an even more disturbing turn when Amina and Sarah(who were 8 and 9 years old respectively) told their grandmother that their father had been sexually abusing them. They said he had been sexually abusing them for around two to three years.\nAfter Patricia found about these accusations, she filed a complaint with the police and left Yaser. After the following up investigation, Yaser was subsequently charged with aggravated assault.\nBut the charges had been later dropped because Amina and Sarah later recanted their prior confessions. They made it all up apparently as they wanted to live with their grandmother.\nYaser worked mostly as a Cab driver now as he was getting fired from most of the menial jobs due to his aggressive nature and bad behaviour.\nHe was becoming increasingly aggressive and controlling with his wife and children and it ended up getting to a point when due to his physical abuse, his daughters ended up seeking medical help. He only consented to them being able to seek medical attention as he thought otherwise he may get in trouble.\nIn 2007, Amina became a senior at high school and Yaser started planning her marriage as he was expecting a big sum of money for getting his virgin daughter married to a rich Egyptian. Amina was not happy with this and rejected one such proposal, which enraged Yaser.\nOne day, Amina and Sarah came to meet their mom who was working at a convenience store as a cashier. They seemed pretty shaken up and told that their father had come to know about the fact they both had boyfriends and that he would kill them. So they hatched a plan and the Mother, two daughters and their two boyfriends left Dallas state and escaped to Oklahoma.\nAfter a few days, Patricia asked Amina and Sarah to accompany them to Texas as she wanted to lay flowers on her mother’s grave. The innocent girls agreed as little did they know that it was all a ploy to get the girls back to texas to meet their father. Unbeknownst to the girls, Yaser had called and convinced Patricia to come back to Dallas.\nHer mom told them en route to Texas that Yaser had forgiven them and wanted to meet them. Although they were reluctant and hesitant at first, she had convinced them that there was nothing to worry about and Sarah finally relented.\nAmina and Sarah\nAmina did not want to do anything with her father and left to meet a friend of hers. Her mother called her but she did not answer her calls, after which Patricia went to her friend's home and finally convinced her to come home to meet her father.\nAfter a few minutes of them reaching the home, Yaser arrived in his taxi and picked his daughters.\nAfter some time, on new year’s eve (Jan 1, 2008) a chilling phone call came in for 911. It was from Sarah. Her father shot her and Amina and left them to die in the taxi. Amina was dead from the bullet wounds, but Sarah was alive and hurt and managed to make the following heartbreaking call.\n911 call audio\nUnfortunately, Sarah also could not make it alive.\nYaser Abdul Said seemed to have vanished from thin air and was assumed to have thought to have flown to the middle east.\nFinally, after 12 years, when it started to seem that justice will never be served to the innocent girls, Yaser Abdul Said was caught on Aug 206, 2020 by the SWAT team. All these years, he was being protected and harbored by his Son at a location of 30 miles from the location where he murdered his daughters in cold blood as he was under the impression that by dating non-muslim boys they had dishonored the family and Islam.\nI smiled, not because I am happy(it still is perturbing as it was years back to read/write about this story where even one’s parent can turn out to be such monsters), but because the painstaking efforts paid off to catch a man who for no reason killed two innocent girls and justice being served. It took decades of hard work by police in pursuing thousands and tips and one agent even postponed his retirement to catch Yaser whose story shocked and disturbed millions worldwide.\nEdit 05-Sep-20:\nBased on the comments and messages, I had added a few of the details pertaining to this case.\nPatricia Owens was not charged with relation to any crime by the police (Although there seems to be some amount of uproar recently to interrogate her).\nAs per Patricia, family members of Said were not at all repentant, but on the contrary very supportive of the heinous crime committed by Yaser as they said that the girls were getting Americanised as they were going out to bars, dating American boys which was dishonouring Islam according to them.\nRegarding Islam Said; He moved in with the Said household and also proclaimed to Patricia that his siblings got what they deserved. Islam was the one who was harboring his father all these years.\nAfter his capture, Amina & Sarah’s Maternal side family made the following comment:\n“After 12 long and grueling years our family is relieved to finally begin the chapter to justice for Amina and Sarah! A deep appreciation is felt from every member of their maternal family to the Dallas FBI and the Irving PD for their relentless pursuit to bring about this day. The announcement of Yaser’s arrest brought tears of elation, and shouts of triumph for us last night. Finally, this monster is no longer free to roam about the world while Sarah and Amina's bright and promising lives were torn away from them by him. We look forward to seeing Amina and Sarah’s day in court.”",

      "2": "It’s got to be The Zipf's law.\nIt says that if you pick any language or a book and rank the most commonly used words then the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\nFor example…\nIf the most used words in a book are ranked as:\n1. The\n2. Of\n3. And\n4. To\n5. A\nthen the word \"Of\" will be used half as often as \"The\". Similarly the word \"And\" will be used (1/3) times as often as the word \"The\". All the words will follow the (1/rank) system.\nThe above image shows the graph of most used words in the book Moby Dick.\nThis law applies to every language, every book and many other things such as city populations, last names, number of phone calls people receive, etc.\nI took two random answers from Quora under the same question and made a word rank using the Internet.\nHere the example of Zipf’s law can be seen; the word “you” is used almost 1/2 as often as the word “The” and the word “of” 1/3 times as often and so on up to rank 5 (because the data is taken from only 1000 words). The more words you use, the more accurate this law gets.\nIt’s amazing how a simple law can define such a complex thing.\nEdit: Watch this video to get a better understanding, as mentioned by Nigel Shake and Raghav Bhandari",
      "3": "Consider a 256 pixels wide, 256 pixels tall greyscale image like below\nA greyscale image has a byte of storage for every pixel, so every pixel can range in value from 0 (being completely black) to 255 (being completely white), totally 256 values.\nThere are 256*256 = 65536 pixels in this image, and since every pixel can have 256 different values, there are totally 256^65536 possible images, from all black, to all white.\n256^65536 is an enormous number and most of these images would look like noise.

      "7": "You have never ever touched anything in your life.\nIf you're reading this, you're probably holding a cellphone right now, or the mouse of your computer, or your laptop is resting on your lap (serving its life’s purpose). You're probably sitting on a chair, in front of a desk or on a toilet seat or relaxing on your bed. Or hundred other things.\nI am sorry to shatter your misconceptions, but you have never actually touched any of ‘em.\nAs we all know, everything, including humans, is made up of atoms - the smallest constituent particles of matter. Every atom has a nucleus at the center, around which the negatively charged electrons continuously revolve. And …\nLikes repel.\nSo technically, whenever an object is seemingly touching another object, the repulsive force between the electrons of the two objects prevents the direct contact between them.\nOur brain perceives this repulsive electromagnetic force as the sensation of touching.\nSo whenever you sit on a chair or throw yourself on the bed, mind it that you are not touching it. You are hovering over it (by infinitesimal distance)!\nAlso, you can say that you have never touched yourself.\nEdit 1:- Electrons can not touch each other: this is a fact. We can not touch anything is a very interesting inference. I am not a scientist. I simply shared what I found extremely amusing and mindblowing. Please refrain from making disparaging comments.\nEdit 2:- Coming to the points raised in the comments section.\nVisibility - The distance of separation is very very very very very very small. Undetectable by the human eye.\nCutting/injury - It works somewhat like this.\nThe scissor blade (generally made up of metal) atoms are packed much more densely packed when compared to those of a cardboard. The force III of repulsion exerted by the atoms of the blade pushes the cardboard atoms away from the area of proximity - resulting in the cutting of cardboard. The density of the matter matters a lot (pun intended). Same is with the piercing of a needle or scratches. Or an unfortunate accident. The concept of force will almost remain the same and human body (the skin, tissues, bones) is relatively fragile compared to a road or falling from 60th floor.\nFriction - Brilliant one. Well, the basic concept of friction involves the consideration of extremely minute irregularities of the surfaces which are in contact. At this level, I think it is possible that the resistance is offered by the locking of crests and troughs due to roughness, despite of not actually touching.\nSensation of temperature - Harish Kolliparat explained it amazingly in his comment -> Heat and cold of an object is its property of atomic vibration. When you heat an object, its atoms vibrate due to excess energy flooding through their body, and they can’t sustain that energy, so to release it out they vibrate. And in the process, they might even give the energy away as photon particles (light) eg: light bulbs. And why do we feel cold objects? Cause, when you take an object at normal temperature, its atoms vibrate at a particular frequency and when you touch(or not?) that object, the atoms in your skin which are at the same frequency of the vibration of the object there is no exchange of heat and you feel no difference. But when it comes to a cold object, since there is loss of energy (heat), its vibration frequency will go down which will alter your skin's atoms’ vibration frequency, so you feel the difference.\nSome videos about the same,\nYou can't touch anything.\nWhat is touch?\nImage credits and information source: Cosmos(TV show) and then Why Physics Says You Can Never Actually Touch Anything\nNewbie on Quora.

      "8": "There’s a million answers to this already, but it looks like none of them have mentioned this one fact that I’m about to bring up, in spite of all the other cosmology stuff.\nThe current, most widely used version of the internet address system is called IPv4\n. It’s kind of like phone numbers for stuff on the internet, and consists of numbers like 192.168.254.254. Every device on the internet is technically required to have one. Its address space starts at 0.0.0.0 and can go all the way to 255.255.255.255, but for administrative reasons, these numbers are unusable, so they are not inclusive. This adds up to a total of\n, or 4,294,967,296 addresses, although again, some of those aren’t usable, so it’s a few less than that. With a human population of about 7.5 billion (and 3.5 billion of them already online\n, plus supporting infrastructure that also needs addresses), it’s pretty obvious that we’re going to need more than that. In fact, we’ve technically already run out of addresses for everything. One of the reasons that this hasn’t been an enormous problem already is thanks to special routers just like the one you use at home, that allow more than one\ninternet-connected device to use a single address.\nThe “next” version is IPv6\n, although it was first proposed in 1992 and is actually already in wide use in much of Asia and on newer cell phones. If you’ve got a 4G capable phone, you’re already using IPv6.\nBut here’s the mind-blowing part. IPv6 doesn’t just increase the number of possible IP addresses by a factor of two, three, or 10. No, these guys weren’t fucking around. The number of possible IP addresses in IPv6 is\nor\n, or if you can’t appreciate the space that scientific notation saves, 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (340.2 Untillion). This is nothing short of an astronomical number. While IPv4 can’t get anywhere near assigning one address to every living human, IPv6 can assign one to every square meter of the disc of the Milky Way galaxy!\nFinally, IP on everything.\nEdited to add:\nFor reference, there are somewhere around\ngrains of sand in the world\n. So yes, you can literally get all the sand on the internet with IPv6 and still have plenty of room to spare for every electronic device we’ve ever built.",
      "9": "There are parts of your DNA that were once parts of viruses.\nRetroviruses are types of viruses that insert their genetic material into the genome of their host cell. Then, the genetic integrated viral material will use the cell’s machinery to create new copies of the virus. Most retroviruses infect somatic cells, which play no role in reproduction, however, a retrovirus can sometimes (it’s really rare actually) infect a germinative cell, like a spermatozoid. In the unlikely case that this spermatozoid is the one to fecundate the egg, the organism developed will carry the viral genome in all of its cells.\nWhile it is unclear how those viral parts (called Endogenous Retroviruses, ERVs) became fixed to our DNA, the most accepted theory is that retroviruses infected our evolutionary ancestors, and evolution brought them to our Homo sapiens genome.\nHowever, these viral genetic segments, albeit of signicant proportion in the genome, comprising 5%-8% of it, are now mostly defective, permeated by mutations which make them harmless.\nNow, if you think this is kinda cool, prepare to have your mind blown…\nHave you ever heard about the 1% difference between the human genome and the chimpanzee genome? If so, have you wondered, if those genomes are so alike, why are we so different from apes?\nOne of the reasons for that is the difference in some of the regulatory regions of the genome. Much of the genetic material (in many species) is not actively coding, they are there just to control the expression of other parts. In other words, although having 99% identical DNA, humans have regulatory mechanisms, that modulate the expression of the genetic material, in a lifelong process that starts in the embryo, making us different from chimpanzees.\nAnd guess what? Among the regulatory regions that are likely responsible for that, many of the are ERVs. That’s right, the viral parts that penetrated into ours ancestors thousands of years ago.\nConclusion: The human DNA segments that were once parts of viruses have probably played an important role in human evolution.\nPS: I’m not sure if this is the BIGGEST MINDFUCK EVER, but it certainly was a big one for me.

      "17": "Can you guess, what are some factors which may lead to the extinction of the human race?\nYou say Global climate change, a disastrous epidemic breaking through the world, or nuclear warfare? Well, you're correct in guessing the above ones, but there's one more.\nHoney Bees. The disappearance of honey bees, to be precise.\nAs stated by Albert Einstein, if the honey bees of the world would go extinct, the human race would cease to exist in few following decades unless scientists invent robotic honey bees to do the task as it was originally done by the bees - pollination.\nHow so, you ask?\nOut of the 100 crop species that provide us with 90% of our food, 70% are pollinated by bees. Bees are the primary initiators of reproduction among plants, as they transfer pollen from the male stamens to the female pistils.\nSome plants are pollinated by the wind, but that rate is very low. Insects are the primary pollinators on the planet. Beetles and butterflies also pollinate, but bees are the most efficient insects for this purpose. Without bees, we wouldn’t be able to savor delicious apples, cherries, and many other fruits and vegetables (blueberries, avocado, broccoli, leafy greens, cucumbers, pumpkins, and much more). Almond trees would be among the first casualties.\nHerbivores animals, who depend on certain plant species, will be affected first. They would go extinct if plants ceased to exist. For example, many cattle used for milk and meat depend on alfalfa and lupins, both of which depend on insect pollination. If the cow’s food supply declines, then meat and milk production will decrease. This will seriously affect the human diet.\nDue to the declining population of herbivores, tertiary carnivores will also begin to suffer immediately.\nSince most plants would be unable to grow, grasslands would become barren and large-scale desertification will take place. Landslides would wipe out villages in one sweep. Ultimately, Earth will become one large plastic-laden desert.\nFurthermore, less production of food crops will ultimately lead to worldwide famine. Hunger and poverty will be very common. Freshwater will start drying up as well, as there will be fewer trees for water retention to occur. With less water and diminishing food, humans will die of thirst and starvation. Fertility would also suffer a setback, followed by a drop in the rate of reproduction. Ultimately, we wouldn’t be able to sustain and would be forced into extinction within a few decades.\nIt's bizarre how this tiny insect holds the reins of human existence, and yet go unnoticed.

      "18": "Straight line is not always the fastest route.\nLet me present to you a simple problem.\nWhat is the fastest path to come down rolling to ground from a height? Restriction is that you can only use gravity as force.\nSo you have to send a round object rolling down from a 5 m height to ground 12 m ahead. What do you think will be the fastest path?\nStraight line AC? Nope. Believe me its very very slow.\nOr something like below, which will accelerate the ball faster initially.\nWell this is faster than straight line for sure. So it establishes that straight line is not always the best way to go. But is there a better solution? Can we calculate the fastest path?\nThis problem of finding the path with least time is called Brachistochrone problem.\nThis problem was unsolved for a long time. Galileo proposed that the solution to the problem will be a circular path. His solution suggested connecting point A and C through a circular path.\nThis one beats all the solutions we discussed above. Galileo was happy and the problem was solved.\nIn comes Johann Bernoulli, with an ingenious (and supposedly final) solution to beat Galileo’s. He proved that a cycloid will beat all other paths.\nWhat is a cycloid?\nA cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as the wheel rolls along a straight line without slippage. Observe the gif below to get a clear picture: (You can view animating gif on desktop only. To watch on mobile just google “cycloid gif”)\nThe red path traced along the x-axis is cycloid. Now lets see how it fits to our problem with following gif: (For animating gif on mobile google “Brachistochrone gif”)\nIn this race, blue one is the cycloid(also called Brachistochrone curve). As you can see cycloid beats all the curves and our favourite “straight line” simply sucks.\nStill doesn’t sound like a mindfuck? No problem.\nGet this, no matter where you start an object on the Brachistochrone, they end up at bottom in the same amount of time. What this means is you can place 10 balls anywhere on the Brachistochrone curve, start the race and they all will finish together. Observe the gif below:(For animating gif on mobile google “Brachistochrone gif”)\nIsn’t it amazing? No other curve has this property but only the fastest one. So, no matter where you start, all will end up at finish line together. You see, Brachistochrone has spiritual meaning too :P.\nTo find out how Bernoulli arrived at this solution and to see Brachistochrone in real action check out the following video by Vsauce.\nI suggest you to surf around and subscribe to this channel for more mindfuck material.\nSources: Google, Youtube",

As Tom Stoppard put it: \"Make a fist, and if your fist is as big as the nucleus of an atom, then the atom is as big as St Paul's, and if it happens to be a hydrogen atom, then it has a single electron flitting about like a moth in an empty cathedral, now by the dome, now by the altar.\"\nIf you forced all the atoms together, removing the space between them, crushing them down so the all those vast empty cathedrals were compressed into the first-sized nuclei, a single teaspoon or sugar cube of the resulting mass would weigh five billion tons; about ten times the weight of all the humans who are currently alive.\nEvents in the future can affect what happened in the past\nThe weirdness of the quantum world is well documented. The double slit experiment, showing that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, is odd enough – particularly when it is shown that observing it makes it one or the other.\nBut it gets stranger. According to an experiment proposed by the physicist John Wheeler in 1978 and carried out by researchers in 2007, observing a particle now can change what happened to another one – in the past.\nAccording to the double slit experiment, if you observe which of two slits light passes through, you force it to behave like a particle. If you don’t, and observe where it lands on a screen behind the slits, it behaves like a wave.But if you wait for it to pass through the slit, and then observe which way it came through, it will retroactively force it to have passed through one or the other. In other words, causality is working backwards: the present is affecting the past.\nOf course in the lab this only has an effect over indescribably tiny fractions of a second. But Wheeler suggested that light from distant stars that has bent around a gravitational well in between could be observed in the same way: which could mean that observing something now and changing what happened thousands, or even millions, of years in the past.\nAlmost all of the Universe is missing\nThere are probably more than 100 billion galaxies in the cosmos. Each of those galaxies has between 10 million and a trillion stars in it. Our sun, a rather small and feeble star (a “yellow dwarf”, indeed), weighs around a billion billion billion tons, and most are much bigger. There is an awful lot of visible matter in the Universe.\nBut it only accounts for about two per cent of its mass.We know there is more, because it has gravity. Despite the huge amount of visible matter, it is nowhere near enough to account for the gravitational pull we can see exerted on other galaxies. The other stuff is called “dark matter”, and there seems to be around six times as much as ordinary matter.\nTo make matters even more confusing, the rest is something else called “dark energy”, which is needed to explain the apparent expansion of the Universe. Nobody knows what dark matter or dark energy is.\nBlack holes aren’t black\nThey’re very dark, sure, but they aren’t black. They glow, slightly, giving off light across the whole spectrum, including visible light.\nThis radiation is called “Hawking radiation”, after the former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University Stephen Hawking, who first proposed its existence. Because they are constantly giving this off, and therefore losing mass, black holes will eventually evaporate altogether if they don’t have another source of mass to sustain them; for example interstellar gas or light.\nSmaller black holes are expected to emit radiation faster compared to their mass than larger ones, so if – as some theories predict – the Large Hadron Collider creates minuscule holes through particle collisions, they will evaporate almost immediately. Scientists would then be able to observe their decay through the radiation.\nThe faster you move, the heavier you get.\nIf you run really fast, you gain weight. Not permanently, or it would make a mockery of diet and exercise plans, but momentarily, and only a tiny amount.\nLight speed is the speed limit of the universe. So if something is travelling close to the speed of light, and you give it a push, it can’t go very much faster. But you’ve given it extra energy, and that energy has to go somewhere.\nWhere it goes is mass. According to relativity, mass and energy are equivalent. So the more energy you put in, the greater the mass becomes. This is negligible at human speeds – Usain Bolt is not noticeably heavier when running than when still – but once you reach an appreciable fraction of the speed of light, your mass starts to increase rapidly.",

O’Brien, O’Malley, O’Bannon, and O’Connor. The apostrophe stands for the letter “S.” It made no sense to call themselves OsBrien, or OsMalley the way it did to say OsIrish, so they dropped the “S” and replaced it with an apostrophe.\nAnd since Osiris was traditionally associated with the colors green and gold, those are the colors that were kept.

      "27": "Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their abilities and to underestimate their incompetence. The more incompetent one is about something, the less aware of it, the more they believe that they are good at it and judge others about it. Also known as the Dunning-Kruger effect it is caused by an unrealistically favorable attitude towards themselves suggested at a subconscious level as a reaction to their ignorance.[1]\nBefore Dunning and Kruger other scholars had intuited this distortion of our mind. Charles Darwin\n, for example, wrote, \"Ignorance breeds confidence more often than knowledge;\" but the first that comes to mind, really is Socrates\nand his \"I know that I know nothing\" famous philosophical concept which exposes this cognitive bias brilliantly:\nI went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought they knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom — therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was.[2]\nThere are three broad categories of illusory superiority: the inflated valuation of oneself’s abilities, an unrealistic optimism for - or a distorted vision of - the future and the illusion of control. This superiority complex is the major cause of a lot of other mindfucks such as, among others, bias, intolerance, entitlement, discrimination, narcissism, manipulation, racism and sexism. All the bullies, warmongers, abusers, rapists, trolls, intransigents (and so on and so forth) out there suffer from this cognitive bias. I can’t imagine a bigger mindfuck than illusory superiority.\nFootnotes\n[1] Dunning–Kruger effect - Wikipedia\n[2] The Internet Classics Archive",
      "28": "THE UNIVERSE HAS NO EDGES\nA common inquiry by those pondering cosmology issues is frequently:\n“If the universe is finite, then where does it end? What's on the other side?”\nGo back to the days of “flat Earth\" believers. They speculated that at some point, the Earth must just “end\"… that if you were in a ship, for example, you would just “sail off”of the edge when you reached it.\nOf course, we now realize that this paradox is resolved by the Earth being spherical. If you have a solar powered drone and have it head north, eventually you'll see it returning from the south. If you send it west, eventually, it will return coming from the east.\nThis is fairly easy to understand because we get that it's not really traveling in a straight line, it's flying along the curve of the Earth's surface.\nIf you were in the middle of nowhere in outer space, things would be different. There's no Earthen surface to constrain your motion. So traveling in one direction means going off to infinity. Right?\n.\nRight?\n.\nNo\n.\nIt turns out that just as the Earth is curved in two dimensions, space is curved in three dimensions.\nSo, if you're in your space suit (and needn't worry about oxygen, heat, waste, food, water, aging, or utter boredom), let's say that you release a space marker that looks like a bicycle (with zero velocity so that it stays put). On its right side, it's painted red, on the left side, yellow, on top it's green and it's blue on the bottom, on the front it's painted purple and on the back it's painted orange. You then, floating just to the right of the bicycle, turn right and fire your thrusters briefly to go in that direction (momentum will carry you from there on out). As you move away from your marker you look over your shoulder and see the red side of the bicycle getting smaller and smaller. You now face forward and wait. Patiently. Perhaps billions of years pass. Eventually, directly in your path in front of you, you see a pinpoint. Slowly a shape emerges. It's a yellow bicycle!\nAs you get closer, you realize that it's only painted yellow on the side you were approaching. Of course, it's your bicycle marker.\nYou're bored, so this time you move to the front of the bike. You head in that direction and when you look back, you see the purple front of the bicycle. Eventually, you see the orange rear of your bicycle in front of you and you return again to where you started.\nNow, though, you decide to try something you couldn't do on Earth. You start slightly above the green top of the bike and continue “up\". As you get higher and higher, you look down and see the tiny green top of the bike getting smaller and smaller. You then look up in the direction you're headed. Eventually, above you you see the blue bottom of your bicycle.\nIn three different directions you've just circumnavigated the universe.

      "30": "We are slowly but steadily heading towards a global economic crisis- one that can neither be stopped nor be prepared for.\nYou may ask, what is new about another economic crisis? Well, in this case the magnitude!\nImagine the far reaching impacts of the 2008 housing-industry crash in USA . Add to that the 2011 Icelandic financial crisis. And the 2010 debt crisis in Greece that crippled their economy. And the 1992 Japanese market collapse. And finally add the mother of all-1939 Great Economic Depression to this deathly blend. Can you imagine the intensity of such an event? Quite like an earthquake measuring 9+ on the richter scale, correct? Well what is awaiting us is possibly a hundred times worse!\nSo how did mankind manage to destabilise the global economy so effectively ?\nAllow me to tell you the “interesting” story of how we “got there”.\nThe story starts with USA, the richest country, and probably the biggest influence on global economy in this planet. The country spends almost 3.9 trillion dollars on pensions, foreign aid, medical care, national security etc. annually. However, the income earned by the country (in the form of taxes, service charges, foreign returns etc.) is a little northwards of 2.1 trillion dollars annually.\nSo where does this deficit of 1.8 trillion dollars (annually) come from?\nSimple- the country does what most of us do when we are in a crippling financial crisis- it borrows money. This is where it gets more interesting. USA, or any country for that matter, doesn’t borrow money by signing documents and promising an EMI. On the contrary, it issues a bond, popularly known as the IOU bond or the I Owe You bond. The bond is issued against a sum lent with a promised rate of interest. The bonds are largely issued to investors-both domestic and abroad- or foreign governments.\nSince you are intelligent you must have already figured out that borrowing is a bad idea when you lack the means to run your house. Of course. I agree with you. But USA also being the intelligent country that it is, always figures out a way to jump hurdles. In this case, it borrows more and issues newer IOUs to pay the old ones.Intelligent? Not much, right? This practice of relentlessly borrowing helped the country amass a debt of 14 trillion dollars- exactly 14000 times the total number of stars in the galaxy.\nThe “galactic” debts eventually caused USA to run out of lenders who would sign more IOUs. Now, the wise solution here was for USA to increase the tax rates significantly or reduce spending. If taxes were increased substantially, this would have further crippled the economy by reducing the spending capacity of an individual and would have probably ousted the government. So what can USA do then? Take the other recourse- reduce spending/ expenditure. Now, this too would reduce the spending capacity of the average American and would also put medical care and security in a bad position.\nCaught between the devil and the deep sea, the government ran to the Federal Reserve-America’s central bank- and plead them to print more notes so that it may pay off the debts and live happily ever after. But happiness was not something written in Uncle Sam’s destiny. Printing more money, as most of you would know, devalues the currency since more of it is available in the market. This results in more dollars buying lesser goods (or goods becoming more expensive)- what we call Inflation.\nWhile USA was battling with inflation, the debts had spawned another demonic force. The foreign governments that had lent USA money had caused the value of the dollar to surge by making USA look rich on lent money. This caused the value of their own currencies to fall against the dollar. Thus, labour and industrial organization became cheaper at the lender country. Hence, the shrewd American industrialist seeing the opportunity, packed his bags and shifted his base to the “cheaper” countries. This led to the average American losing his job- what we call Recession. (If at this point you are wondering whether China- the major country where labour is outsourced from- is also a lender; then let me assure you that you are a hundred percent right. China is USA’s biggest lender). Thus, the dependency on our superpower-USA- increased again. Like we discussed earlier, more the dependency, more the expenditure. Ultimately, despite lending and signing newer IOUs and desperately running the dollar printing machine twenty four hours a day, USA was getting pushed further and further into debt. The debts eventually forced the country to borrow even more money since that was the only alternative left.\nSo debt bred more debt and more debt bred further more debt. This lethal cycle of debts will eventually force our superpower towards a major bankruptcy (economic crisis to be specific).\nMy non-American friends must be now wondering, why should they bother?\nUnderstand that the day the US economy collapses and the country stops paying its debts, the countries that lent it money- which is most probably yours too- will be unable to retrieve the large sums that they had lent and will themselves head towards an economic meltdown.\nWhere does this cycle of destruction stop?\nPossibly after it has consumed the economy of each and every country on this planet. That my friend, will be an economic collapse which will be the first of its kind! What the intelligentsia today are calling a global economic meltdown.\nWe can’t predict its magnitude or implications because mankind hasn’t faced one yet.\nWhat can you do ?\nAbsolutely nothing. At the most you can tell your friends this story and assure them that there are greater dangers awaiting us in this world than an alien invasion or a largescale meteor shower.

It is simply called as a point of no return.\nWhat will happen if you fall into a black hole?\nLet's assume that you start outside the event horizon of the black hole. As you look toward it, you see a circle of perfect darkness. Around the black hole, you see the familiar stars of the night sky. But their pattern is strangely distorted, as the light from distant stars gets bent by the black hole's gravity. As you go deeper into the black hole, space becomes ever more curvy until, at the centre, it becomes infinitely curved. This is the singularity. Black holes warp space and time to such an extreme that inside the black hole's horizon, space and time actually swap roles. In a sense, it really is time that pulls you in toward the singularity. You can't turn around and escape the black hole, any more than you can turn around and travel back to the past.\nAs you fall toward the black hole, you move faster and faster, accelerated by its gravity. Your feet feel a stronger gravitational pull than your head, because they are closer to the black hole. As a result, your body is stretched apart. For small black holes, this stretching is so strong that your body is completely torn apart before you reach the event horizon.\nIf you fall into a supermassive black hole, your body remains intact, even as you cross the event horizon.

If you can’t, there is no sense in playing along, but consider your mind prematurely blown because you don’t know what circles are.\nIf you can tell the difference, I wonder if you picked #5. That’s what I would pick. But the real circle is actually number four. I’m typing out the number this time, because I suspect if the four in this text registered while you were looking at the images above, it might unconsciously influence you. So why did I use a real number for five if it might influence the results? Well, I have to admit I want you to agree with me, but I think the notion that you can be influenced at all about which shape is the correct circle is interesting in itself. If that’s who you are, consider yourself a prematurely blown herd animal.\nHere is the point to this though. I’m a graphic designer, and I work with geometric shapes often. The circle is probably the shape I use the most. But one day, almost a year ago, I realized my circles don’t actually look like circles! If you look at the vector outline of a circle, you will see 4 nodes on the outer extremes in all four directions.\nNow, it could be that I’ve internalized these nodes, but this is essentially what I see with all circles; I see four extremes, and each curve between the nodes seems ever so slightly flattened (see #1, where the curves are actually flattened). So what I started doing was to ever so slightly bulge up the curves (#6 is a more severe example) so that it would actually look like a perfect circle.\nIsn’t that funny? I have to deviate from a circle to make it appear like a circle. But I started wondering if it didn’t have something to do with the vector outlines I was working with, so I looked at images of clocks online. But you know what? I saw the same effect!\nI figured perhaps it has to do with my perception of my screen somehow, so I looked at a physical circle, which again, didn’t look like an actual circle to me. I could still see the nodes, whereas a real circle shouldn’t have a preferred direction. I saw pseudo-circles everywhere!\nI then had to test this with others. If other people weren’t observing the same thing, I shouldn’t be bulging up my circles for logos and such, because my clients will see bulged up circular shapes where I see perfect circles. So I devised a test, which you can see here: Pseudo-circles\nI showed it to several people, and although some people did pick out the actual circle, I would say most people picked the one I preferred as a circle. The test group was small however, so I don’t know the statistical significance. But the fact that we can disagree on what a genuine circle is, is fascinating in itself.\nSince then I’ve theorized that it might have something to do with how we perceive faces, as they have clear verticals and horizontals which in a sense internalizes those nodes. Of course human faces are not circular, but I think there is something to how we process visual information—and (human) faces in particular.\nNow, I don’t know if my test actually worked on you (meaning you picked #5 instead of #4). If you read this far and think to yourself “What the fuck is he talking about?”, then I guess consider your mind blown to the idea that there are people like me in this world, who don’t see circles as actual circles. Consider then how I do see the world at large…\nMind blown? I’m stretching it, am I not?",

Now there exists a different universe in which you chose to wear the red one that day. Now the balancing figure here is that if there is no significant differences during the day in the two seperate universes, that the days went almost identical (A few extra girls smiling at you doesn't count (it's a fact that red t-shirts are more liked by girls)) then the branching universe would just merge back from the originating one.

There are colors that we cannot see or even comprehend because our eyes do not have enough cones/aren’t built to detect it.\nYeah, have you ever seen one of these?\nA thermal infrared photo?\nThat’s not what it actually looks like. Infrared is a completely different type of light than the “visible” light our eyes detect. These cameras just “translate” the infrared rays into visible light rays so we can “see” it. Infrared doesn’t actually look that way. In fact, we don’t have the slightest idea what infrared does look like. As with gamma rays, x-rays, radio waves, etc. The photos look that way because they are translated into something our brains can comprehend - red being the hotter parts and blue the coolest. So the next time you see a photo like this, know that the entire photo is a lie.\n2. The colors we can see technically don’t “exist”.\nEach color we see is just white light - composed of red, green, and blue light. These colors are either being absorbed, transmitted, or reflected - giving us the colors we see every day. For example: that red apple on the table you see over there? It’s just white light being split up - the green and blue light get absorbed while the red light is reflected and received by our eyes - making the apple appear red. Here comes the crazy part - we have no idea what color it actually is. There are no special glasses, you can’t get surgery on your eyes, there’s no magic that can make you be able to see what color it actually is. For all we know, it could be rainbow, or some color that we can’t see, outside our rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, in case you needed a refresher).\nA photo from Wikipedia. Not pictured: two people shining lights on a brick wall while the third one struggles to take a photo with their foot while holding the third.\nWhat about that black car you saw? If the white light is only red, green, and blue, why is it black? That’s because all three of the colors are being absorbed by the car, leaving us with no light. When this gets received by our eyes, it’s black. All the other colors are some sort of combination between red, green, and blue. The banana you ate earlier is just a mixture of red and green light being reflected, and the blue light is being absorbed. This is why in that one memory you have, when you went up to your TV as a little kid and smushed your face on the screen, you saw little tiny red, green, and blue dots (I was a weird kid - did everyone experience this, or was it just me?). That’s literally what I just explained to you. All the colors on your TV are being mixed in different ways, showing us the rainbow of colors you see every day. This may be less conspicuous on newer TVs, though.\nBut, Sarah, in art class, you couldn’t make yellow. The primary colors were red, blue, and yellow! What are these lie-\nThis is not art class.

    "title": "Why does General Milley say the world is in a dangerous situation if Putin wins the war in Ukraine",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Because Putin won’t stop with Ukraine. His ultimate goal is to try to restore the entire Soviet Union to where it was before it was broken up in 1991. That means that he would go after a number of other Eastern European states that were once part of the Soviet Union.",
      "2": "Because it will set the precedent that imperialism is not only acceptable, but still possible.\nAn aggressor nation can invade another nation, take what they want, and get away with it.\nIf Putin succeeds in Ukraine, then what’s to stop him from doing the same in Georgia (again), Moldova, or anywhere else?\nNot only that, but China will also become emboldened and the chances of them attacking Taiwan will increase.",
      "3": "Because it will show the world that the order, created in 1945 by the UN Charter, is failing, and every mad dictator can use force to achieve his goals in politics. China and Taiwan will follow soon. Probably, Iran will attempt to invade Israel. India and Pakistan still have some unsolved questions. And Putin, after a rest, will try to get something next - maybe Georgia, maybe Moldova, maybe Kazakhstan; but what if it will be Estonia, a NATO member? Putin have already demanded NATO to “withdraw to the 1997 state” - without all the Eastern Europe and France in Joint Command, making clear he’s interested in controlling the Eastern Europe with military force.",
      "4": "It seems fairly obvious that if any bigger country can be the bully without repercussions, and do what it wants to the people of another country, that the dangerous situation exists. All the smaller countries then say when is it our turn to be raped and murdered?",
      "5": "Vladimir Putin is the head of Russia, which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\nThe 5 member countries of the UN Security Council are supposed to set an example and help guarantee peace in the world by maintaining its stability.\nIf Russia acts as it has in Ukraine since February 2022, what signal is it sending to all dictators and autocrats around the world?\nRussia is sending the signal that might is always best.\nIf Russia loses this war in Ukraine, then everyone will draw the necessary consequences: democracies are ready to fight to preserve their values and freedom.\nIf Russia wins, then everyone will say that it is possible to act by imposing force without much consequence.\nFurthermore, once Russia has control of Ukraine, it is a safe bet that in the future, Putin or an even more extremist successor than him will say that it is time to attack a member country of NATO. It seems impossible today, but these dictators only understand force, they would say that their victory in Ukraine is a sign that they can go further.\nFor world peace, but obviously also for the Ukrainians, a humiliating defeat of Putin's Russia is the only viable option.",
      "6": "Because it will be the equivalent of Hitler and the Nazis threatening Europe after the dissection of Poland 1939.\nIn that era there were no intercontinental bomber planes, missiles or nuclear weapons to package any of them.",
      "7": "Because Russia won’t stop with Ukraine.",
      "8": "Wins the war in Ukraine? I guess he did not mention “the war”, and for some reason, you are not quoting him carefully.\n>> CBS' Norah O'Donnell asked Milley why funding Ukraine was worth the effort \"with all of the issues facing Americans at home.\" Milley responded: \"If Ukraine loses and Putin wins, I think you would be certainly increasing, if not doubling, your defense budget in the years ahead.” It looks like he is sharing his experience: “And you will increase the probability of a great power war in the next ten to fifteen years. I think it would be a very dangerous situation\" if the Russian leader's invading forces were \"allowed to win.\" <<\nThere is no war in Ukraine, there is Putin’s Russia committing a chain of crimes against the world trying to use Ukraine as a whipping boy.\nSeeing that, Gen. Milley wants to advise you that Putin’s actions there are against the whole world, including your country. But should you don’t care about the future, you could just ignore the opinions/precautions of experienced men.\nI would interpret his words in this way: “Sitting on your hands now you are giving Putin an opportunity to increase his military and “special operation forces” power and develop much more problems.”",
      "9": "Because it would be. Things that encourage bullies like Putin are not good for the world.",

      "11": "You can ask Hitler is the shortest answer.\nThe longest is that the unprecedented nuclear blackmail Russians used in order to facilitate it’s aggressive conquest of a 45 million people nation, could be used as an example for other nuclear capable countries in order to facilitate their own aggressive revisionism or expansion against other nations. It would also be the case of Western (or anyone’s for that matter) nuclear deterrence failing when it is needed the most, so there will be no (perceived) deterrence for followers or even Russia to repeat such aggression, which will definitely lead to more aggressive wars, other non-nuclear nations seeking their own nukes, eventually a nuclear Armageddon in the not so far future. That’s the nuke thingy about it.\nThen there will be a renewed or rather a worst Cold War than the previous one, with all that comes along with it, from economic and social to cultural and geopolitical, and many more wars to come as a result. We already have seen the results of this aggression as the worst humanitarian-refugee crisis, energy-food crisis, environmental-nuclear crisis, ever since the end of WWII, and not even a couple of years have past. We now see Russia promoting its declared threats globally, and others perceiving Western reluctance to finish off Russian aggression in Ukraine as a weakness or opportunity to initiate their own aggressive and violent agendas.\nThe World is already at the early stages of what a Russian victory in Ukraine would bring.",
      "12": "Because U.S. dominance depends entirely on the extent to which countries with resources are dependent on the U.S.\nIf Russia gets out from under the U.S., other subordinate countries will reach out to Russia. That is, Russia will become the flagship of the anti-Western movement, and the West will cease to exist in its present form.\nOf course, there is still a factor of natural decline in the efficiency of the capitalist system (money saturation, falling demand, etc.) that will hit the West without any war, but perhaps General Milley just does not know about it (after all, he is a general, not an economist).",
      "13": "What is Putin’s next step, being emboldened by victory against Ukraine and the West? Invade NATO countries, like the Baltics and Poland? Then we have a DIRECT confrontation. And where do suppose that leads?",
      "14": "Milly is not to be trusted, and everything he says should be questioned. This is a general who kept thinking the Russians would win in Ukraine.\nI get it; he was trying to make them look bigger than they are in order to ensure he has a job.\nHe should be honest because we are really prepping for war with China. The Russo-Ukrainian war is on cruise control unless something weird happens; it should be over in a few years.\nHaving fighting seasons is a major issue. The Russians are not out be a longshot the odds are against them.\nThe outcome of the war effects Europe for the next 100+ years.",
      "15": "Like all generals, when they make speeches, they instigate public increase of military spending, so this or this general buddy would get comfortable retirement. Otherwise, without such speeches, public would just move on with their lives. If, highly unlikely, Putin wins Ukraine, he would install puppet leader, like USA did many times in SAmerica. Such purpet will be well supported by pro Russian regions South and South East of Ukraine.",
      "16": "Danger here defined by any impediment to the US becoming the single unitary hegemon of the world , supported by its other Anglo-Saxon Western civilizational bigots and supremists and their ability to flip nations to go their way.",
      "17": "Because he is serving to the deep state. The goal of the deep state is to maintain US domination in the world to ensure cheap resources and properties for transnational companies. The main obstacles are China and Russia, because they are sovereign states. The deep state planned to destroy Russia. This plan failed. Now it applies plan B, to weaken Russia as much as possible. Therefore, USA and its vassals will waging proxy war on Ukraine as long as possible. Zelensky was told by his American and British masters to fight up to the last Ukrainian. He executes this order obediently and is exterminating Ukrainians in the meat grinder.\nBesides, Zelensky sold most Ukrainian lands and properties to transnational companies. If Russia wins, transnational companies will lose all.",
      "18": "Because he is the mouthpiece of US imperialism. The world is already in a dangerous position because the USA are the dominaring super power in this world and defend this position with all means including endless wars.",
      "19": "Because they are the biggest mafia organization on the planet, the size of a huge country, with the resources of a fairly large country.",
      "20": "Because it will prove that aggression, even in Europe, will be rewarded and a viable option to aggrandize power. Europe had been largely at peace since WW II. Retaking Ukraine as part of a new USSR or Russian Empire will make other parts of Europe seem open to invasion.",
      "21": "For once Milley is right. Having the male population of Ukraine as cannon fodder in the Russian army would become a real problem for any country attacked by the Russian empire. That was am important part of Putin’s plan from he beginning. If Putin had Ukraine it would take all of NATO to stop him and a huge number of people would die."

A couple of weeks ago I went to the piercers with the intention of getting number 4 in the right ear just above my 3rd. However, on deciding where it should go I asked for the mark to be made a little higher than the usual ‘4th’ lobe piercing. After agreeing where it would go I lay back and had a needle piercing for the first time. The slight ‘crunch’ sound as the needle went in was unusual after being used to the ‘gun’ approach. After the 2mm metal ball had been screwed onto the 10mm labret I was asked to take a look in the mirror.\nTo my slight surprise I had misjudged where the ‘higher’ pen mark had been placed and found my new ear stud half way up my ear! I was going to be even more adventurous when I first entered the shop and have a high helix piercing, but am now really pleased with what I have. I’m sure later this year I’ll go and get the obvious cartilage piercing done as it won’t look out of place with my other 4 in my right ear.\nUPDATE : Just added another to my left!

It comes in handy for when I lose one of a pair of ear studs.

      "28": "11 I want more though. 5 in one and 6 in the other. I do have nose stud. I can't wait for tax time! I'm getting 3 more then.",

      "30": "Currently a piercing in each lobe, a tragus in my left and an upper cartilage in my right, however I used to have 4 in each lobe and 3 upper cartilage piercings. I was addicted to getting my ears pierced!!",
      "31": "One in each ear. I am giving my body when I die to a medical school and want to get a small tattoo saying “Handle with care”.\nThis way there are no funeral costs and maybe it will help someone. Sorry to get off the subject a bit.",
      "32": "My earlobes are both pierced twice and I have a piercing in my right upper cartilage/helix. I had my lobes done with guns which isn't the wisest choice but I was younger and didn't know better. I got my helix pierced with a needle at a professional piercing parlor and I wear a small gold hoop in it that I really love :)",
      "33": "I have four piercings. Two that I got when I was ~two months old and two that I recently got. So that means I have three earlobes percings in my right ear and another one on my second. It looks kinda cool.",
      "34": "Original question: how many piercings do you have in your ears?\nI only have one in each ear.\nI want more though… a Helix definitely. And probably a daith.\n(A2A)",
      "35": "As of now none. I had 9 in my right and 5 in my left before. I now have a chronic medical issue that requires me to be put to sleep every 6 months so I got tried of removing them and just left them out.",
      "36": "One piercing in each lobe and one in the top left. I do not wear the right one for sometime now per Wife, I do not know why.",
      "37": "Sadly none. I always have liked how other people can get tattoos and piercings, but i kind of never had anything like that. I think i was always told you wont ever get a job if you have something like that. What will people think etc. And later i just felt like it was not that important. But my inner goth always wanted something like that.",
      "38": "One in each ear and I only wear simple gold hoops.",
      "39": "Currently three in each (including stretched lobes to 3/4 inch). Used to have six in one and four in the other.",
      "40": "Going by how everyone else is answering, I'm going to say six, three in each earlobe. I did really try for my tragus on my right ear, but I was fighting a massive blister for almost 6 months that stopped it from healing. It was making it hard to wear earbuds or use a stethoscope but I wanted it so bad. Then I had to take it out for surgery and well, it wasn't going back in. I like the look of industrial piercings and the triple helix/triple forward helix combo (not on the same ear, obviously) but I'm worried I would have to same blister problem again and that I wouldn't ever be able to sleep on them or wear my favorite headphones anymore.",
      "41": "My first piercings were my right ear - a helix (cartilage) and a lobe piercing in November. Several months later I got my other lobe pierced. Now (the August after getting pierced) I plan on getting a helix piercing just above the original one as it looks a bit lonely on my ear (and a septum piercing, but that’s not ear). In a few months I’ll get my tragus on my left ear pierced after the helix is healed. So currently 3, planning 2 more",
      "42": "I only have the ones I got when I was born. BEen thinking of getting more because I LOVE piercings too much but I have problems with my ears so I’m a bit shaky.",
      "43": "Four total now.\nFirst hole on both side stretched to 3/4″, two more 14G holes in the left lobe.\nI used to also have an industrial in the left side but had my ears pointed so that went bye.",
      "44": "I only have three. My left earlobe is pierced and stretched to 1/2 an inch and my cartilage is pierced. My right ear is pierced and stretched to 2g.",
      "45": "Once upon a time I had one.\nIn college I removed my ear piercing for good. I had my tongue pierced at one point in time as well, but I swallowed the ball on accident, took the ring out, and didn’t put one back in so it filled up.\nI heal amazingly quick when holes have been added to my body.\nI had “re” pierced my ear in the exact same spot 3 times prior to just removing it altogether and it had grown too much of a pain in the butt to continue having it.",
      "46": "My dad thought it’s inhuman. I have one in each ear though. It’s better to avoid using heavy earrings for long time & protect earlobes from splitting.",
      "47": "I have 0 piercings on my ears. I have 0 anywhere on my body. I don’t mind piercings but I’m not into it.",
      "48": "I currently have 3 separate piercings: 1 forward helix and 2 lobe piercings in each ear. I use to have two helix piercings, but I took them out years ago.",
      "49": "I personally have two on the lobe on each side, but many people of course have many more than this everywhere on the ears, to each his own .",
      "50": "I have a pair of lobe piercings, a tragus, and a conch.\nI had a pair of tragus before, but one of them was infected badly I needed to have a surgery.\nAfter this I want to have a daith if it's possible, because mine is pretty small."

    "answers": {
      "1": "I shot a perfect score in basic and I got an expert badge to hang on my uniform. They also asked me if I could do that in combat and I said no. On my first assignment at Fort Huachuca, which was basically a country club. The first time we had to qualify I sight in my rifle and put three dead center. The range officer asked me if I wanted to shoot or take the day off and I took the day off. You don't get anything special for being a good shot. However, if you want to learn the secrets to becoming an exceptional boot camp sharpshooter, I highly recommend checking out this informative article on Cracking the Military's Bullseye Code: The Path to Becoming an Exceptional Boot Camp Sharpshooter\n. It provides valuable insights and techniques that can help you take your shooting skills to the next level.",
      "2": "That depends.\nDuring my time in basic training, no one got 40/40 “hawkeyes”. Its pretty rare for someone to get a perfect score. If you got a perfect score in basic training, you’d have massive bragging rights within your platoon and you’d proudly wear one of these on your uniform during graduation:\nExpert Marksman badge, earned by shooting over 36/40. Very common in the infantry. Some would say that it’s the standard while you’re serving in an infantry company.\nWhile you’re in basic training it would lead to some good bragging rights next to your peers. I remember my relief being part of the expert club my first time qualifying. There’s a pressure to perform, and you want to be part of the best. The other medals don’t look as good on your dress uniform.\nNow, I was in the 82nd airborne division. When you’re with paratroopers, our job is to do this:\nHallelujah it’s raining men\nIf your question changes to what would happen if you constantly shot 40/40 at your unit, then my answer would change a bit. The culture of the 82nd means that we’re a high tempo, constantly deployed and constantly training organization. While serving with the 82nd, I went to the range every couple of months since I was attached to an infantry company. The infantry trains a lot. So, if you were constantly, always shooting 40/40, you would have a reputation in your company for excellence, which could possibly work in your favor if you wanted to go to elite schools. It wouldn’t be everything, but if you were a PT stud, constantly shot 40/40, and were a squared away soldier, I could see your company commander wanting to send you to every school you asked for. You’re an asset at that point, and it’s ALWAYS good to be an asset. Hell, you might even be able to drop a packet to go to Special Forces selection. High performers in the army are encouraged to improve their careers and excel in all aspects.\nFurthermore, If you were in a regular rifle squad, I would see it likely you could put in a request to get transferred to the sniper section and get more training. While I was in, the snipers section were incredibly selective. They should be- I was attached to the snipers for awhile and I’ll tell you, it’s a lot of fun but everyone wants to be a sniper until it’s time to do sniper things. (Think about not being able to move if there’s bugs crawling all over you, it sucks). But if you’re constantly shooting hawkeyes, they might want to bring you under their wing and see how you do. While you’re in the snipers section, the world opens up to you in terms of opportunity. You would have the ability to prove yourself and show your unit leadership what you’re made of. If you constantly keep up extremely high performance, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary to send you to Ranger school, sniper school, pathfinder school, or be sent to compete and represent your unit at different shooting events. This is where the crème of the crop, the elite of the elite train and compete against each other for their units prestige.\nSpecial operations hosted International sniper competition.\nAt the very top of the ladder is the Army’s Presidents Hundred competition. Here, if you were to score at top 100 of the leaderboard, you would theoretically be one of the best marksman’s the Army has to offer. That would earn you the Presidents Hundred tab, which is a permanent award you can wear on your regular uniform. I have only seen a soldier with the tab once in my military career. (Funnily enough, it was while I was doing my initial training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma)\nMember of the 82nd Airborne Div with the Presidents Hundred tab. Now that will get some heads turning.",
      "3": "40 out of 40 in basic training though very rare happens. 99.99% of Drill Sergeants never shot 40 out of 40 in qualifying.\nBack in 1983 when Grenada was heating up and I was on Drill Sergeant status, word came down to re-qualify all battalion members and support personnel on the rifle range. The 2 best marksman were to be candidates for sniper school. Well the best two turned out to be the chaplain and myself a medic, both scoring a perfect 40 out of 40. LOL\nThat put our battalion commander in an embarrassing position with the brigade commander in explaining how seasoned infantry soldiers couldn’t out score support soldiers. Afterwards all infantry personnel were given remedial marksmanship classes for the following weeks.\nGrenada was over quickly and no one ended up going to sniper school from our brigade.\nA recruit scoring 40 out of 40 would be give...",
      "4": "Although incredibly rare, it possible to do with some luck and possibly some “Pit Love”.\nThe definition is meaning the two recruits who are working your target mark your shot as a hit no matter what. This would also include a bullseye regardless of where your shot actually landed.\nEven then, all of that would be hard since there are also DI’s supervising the pits to maintain the integrity.\nWhen I went through boot camp, nobody in my platoon or company scored a perfect on the rifle range let alone hit the bullseye on every shot.\nI’m reality it’s more or less a pipe dream. If by some chance it did happen, that target would be very carefully scrutinized by the DI’s to make sure the recruits weren’t cheating it.\nFor what it’s worth, that’s going to largely depend on your range instructor and of course your drill instructor(s).\nYour standing as a recruit in the platoon will matter as well.\nStory time: During “Range Week” in boot camp, we had a recruit in my platoon that scored just a few points from a perfect score off on table one and table two overall.\nI’d imagine somewhere he had a few bullseye hits along the way. IIRC, he was also in the top 5 of shooters in the entire company. Definitely the top shooter in my platoon.\nOn the day our company qualified on the range, our range instructor made a promise that whoever got a perfect score on the “Rapid fire”, which was at the 200 and 300 yard marking, would be able to make a personal 10 minute phone call to their family using his personal cellphone.\nThat particular recruit I’m referring to managed to score a perfect on one the rapid fire phase for both ranges. He was rewarded with the phone call.\nHe was already a squad leader as it was. On graduation day, he was selected as the honor grad, promoted to PFC, and selected as platoon guide. He also happened to be infantry like I was and went to SOI with me. His MOS ended up being an 0331 machine gunner and was stationed at Camp Pendleton.",
      "5": "There was a kid in basic training with us who hit 40 out of 40.\nDidn’t look the type - I’d imagined the best shot would probably be some hillbilly from Hatfields and McCoys country who’d hunted squirrels in the Appalachians since he was a toddler for supper or some such. Instead, he was a Mexican kid from Texas. Not even from out in the sticks, but the suburbs.\nOther than getting the marksmanship expert badge, he was dogged by drill sergeants just like the rest of us. Didn’t notice that he was treated any different or better afterwards.\n(Getting a perfect score didn’t stop him from getting smoked like everybody else - YouTube)",
      "6": "There has never been a perfect score for Table 1 in USMC Recruit Training. The current record holder is Austin Ferrell, who shot 248/250 in August of 2020 at Parris Island. A perfect score is 50 shots on the black from all three distances. A 248 means that he missed the bullseye on two shots, but still impacted the target area.\nAfter Table 1, there are 50 additional points for Table 2. Table 2 is dedicated to close distance, drills, and reaction time, and is much less precise.\nI was a Marine for 6 years, and only ever heard of one single person who shot perfect on Table 1 in the Fleet. She was a competitive target shooter, and the military paid for her to have breast-augmentation, which gave her a better shooting-frame.",
      "7": "In the Finnish military, it would earn him the golden shooting insignia and three days’ home leave. (Actually 91 points on ten rounds is enough.)\nIf your IQ test is Stanine 8 or higher, and you are psychologically suitable, you have just earned a training for the specialization of a sniper or a marksman.\nThe best score in my own company was 98 points with RK-62 at 150 m on ten rounds (bullseye = 10 points). The diametre of the bullseye is 10 cm.\nEDIT: My hubby just recruited some time ago an IT specialist who really had a cow’s nerves and turned out not to get nervous on any issue and never has lost his cool. Turned out he has received a sniper training in the military when he was a conscript. The psychology matters at least as much as the shooting skills.",
      "8": "I shot a perfect score in basic and I got an expert badge to hang on my uniform. They also asked me if I could do that in combat and I said no. On my first assignment at Fort Huachuca, which was basically a country club. The first time we had to qualify I sight in my rifle and put three dead center. The range officer asked me if I wanted to shoot or take the day off and I took the day off. You don't get anything special for being a good shot.",
      "9": "There is no “bullseye” when qualifying during basic training. You fire at popup targets ranging from 25 to 300 yards and if you hit them, they go down, regardless of what part of the target you hit. If you miss, they'll go down automatically after a second or two. If you hit 40 out of 40 shots you're a “hawkeye”, but that is nothing other than a term of endearment (which I promise, nobody cares about). Your Drill Sergeant may give you a compliment, but you'll get the same expert badge as somebody who shot 36 out of 40.\nEDIT: As some have pointed out, my answer pertains only to the US Army's basic training. A trainee's performance in other service branches during training may earn you certain opportunities and awards, though I am not qualified to speak to that.",
      "10": "I enlisted in 1991.\nHad 3 years of JROTC, and was on the rifle team, not to mention having been a child of that early 80s, a master of Duck Hunt (before everyone figured out the brightness trick)\nSo going to the range, I thought I’d do OK, compared to everyone else.\nStanding Pistol. Hit everything. Was pretty interesting, the silhouette would pop up, and fall when you shot. Everyone was doing well, even the dummy that held the weapon gangster style and actually got a round off before the range sergeant saw him.\nQualified expert, no problem, never missed a shot. So DI pulled all the experts for a contest. 10 shots, farthest targets.\n1st round 10 for 10.\n2nd round 10 for 10.\nand so on for a few more rounds, not sure how many we did, maybe 5 or 6. Next to last shot, the target doesn’t fall. dirt flies up behind him, so the people behind me maintain I hit it, but with a day of shooting, I must have gone through one of the growing holes in the targets. No matter, DI declared me second, and we ran back to the barracks. Not that I’m bitter or anything.\nI did win the rifle competition though. I was the only one that could hit 10 for 10 kneeling, because none of the country boys fired kneeling- because who would in real life?\nSo what happened?\nCongratulations PFC Snipes, you get to lead the run back to the barracks!\nDang I’m old.",
      "11": "At Fort Jackson, in the mid-80s, we were told that any 40/40 “hawkeyes\" on record fire day would receive a helicopter ride back to the battalion area and wouldn't have to march back in formation.\nOne scrawny guy from New Jersey did it, but apparently nobody was *expected* to achieve that. So the rest of us got back to the battalion area a couple of hours before they got a helo dispatched to pick the guy up. While he got a free ride back, he missed chow, so he got an MRE for supper while us lesser marksmen got hots in the chow hall.\nFrankly, I'd rather have hot chow than a ride back. Some of those mid-80s MREs sucked raw, unwashed ass.",
      "12": "Meet this guy, Carlos Norman Hathcock.\nIn his days attending high school, many of them brought a 22 rifle and hunt for extra meat after school.\nHe joined the Marines and won the Wimbledon Cup at Camp Perry, shooting a target at 1000 yards. In his autobiography, he mentioned that there were so many things to learn and to be trained in the USMC, shooting skills didn't make him anything special.\nP. S. Thanks for all who read this and correct my mistakes. It has been almost 20 years that I read his book. Marine Sniper, 93 confirmed kills",
      "13": "Let’s look at a “normal kid’s story”. See this young man? He shot his first .22 when he was four. He got his first rifle when he was 6. He was trained in marksmanship in Boy Scouts and Civil Air Patrol. He has shot all types of firearms (pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles) and has taught many other kids to shoot.\nHe went to boot camp and shot expert.\nWhat happened?\nWhen he graduated boot camp he went to become a Warrant Officer to fly helicopters at 18.\nWhy wasn’t he selected to be a sniper? Because he was contracted to be a pilot and the army needs qualified people.\nGenerally, in the U.S. Army, your contract will dictate your job if you are successful through Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training. Yes, if you are an 11A you might be invited to sniper school, but the army needs soldiers in many roles.\nRemember, only 27% of the US military age population can qualify to join the armed forces. The military needs highly intelligent people to run Patriot missile batteries, Cyber applications, fire HIMARS and fly drones….all highly sophisticated systems that can have a greater impact than a sniper in modern warfare.",
      "14": "With the M-16 I shot a 100 unscramble, as I ate about a golf ball sized whole out of the 10 rIngs X. There were also a few rounds scattered around the target that I didn't understand. The marksmanship instructor tole me they were probably from the guys on each side of me shooting my target by mistake.\nOur TI mentioned some of the scores at mail call that evening and told me that I was now the proud owner of the US Air Force small arms expert ribbon, and he handed me one ad he shook my hand. That was all, other the ribbon created more possible demerits during inspection.",

      "16": "I went in the AF in 1969, and we fired a total of 60 rounds at a stationary target. 10 rounds practice, and 50 rounds for qualification. The targets were the human silhouette size at 100 yards. Anyways a bunch of us hit the target every time, ya know what we won? We got to clean up the range.",
      "17": "Original Question: What would happen if a military recruit in boot camp never missed a shot and always hit bullseye during the rifle training course? What awards would they be eligible for?\nI was that kid during Infantry One Station Unit Training at Fort Benning in 1982. Up to that point, along with every other recruit in the platoon, I was sure my Drill Sergeant hated me. Pretty universal for a recruit with just a few weeks in the Army at that point to have that feeling because the watchful Drill catches nearly all your frequent f-ups and makes sure you know by making you pay for it somehow, like making an example of you and making everyone in your platoon do push-ups for your mistake(s).\nWe came back from the Basic Rifle Marksmanship qualification range via road-march. I had a good day and shot well while at the range. This is three weeks into “Basic Training” at this point. Every minute of your time is micro-managed to form you into a soldier. After evening chow, the Drill marched us over to the Shop-ette (a little tiny Post Exchange store about the size of your typical 7–11) to purchase toothpaste, shave cream or whatever else we might need. You were allowed to get a snack, if you could down it quickly, because you couldn’t bring it back to the barracks. No alcohol could be purchased. We waited outside the tiny shop while 4 soldiers at a time cycled through to quickly purchase what they need and got back in the formation outside.\nThe Drill Sergeant had gone in to apparently check on a few of the recruits and came back out. He called me over beside the formation, “Private Mullen, come over here!”. I came over there and he handed me two 16 ounce cans of Schlitz Malt Liquor. “Drink ‘em up! You got until the last four Privates finish up in there!”. I knew that I had shot well, but up until this point, I didn’t know that I had the only max score in the company. So, I slammed the two cans! Not my choice of beverage, but it was a nice gesture and I appreciated it!\nDuring the rest of Infantry training, in addition to M16 qualification, we had to formally qualify with auto rifle table, grenades, M203 Grenade Launcher, and a Bayonet Assault Course. I qualified expert with everything. There were only two of us in the basic training company that did this. There are three levels of qualification and they become harder to obtain: Marksman, Sharpshooter, and then Expert from bottom to top. Not every weapon we shot was recorded for official qualification, but you did get three official “bars” for your qualification badge(s): Rifle, Grenade, and M-203. The rest were just categorized as familiarization fires, so they could show that you had exposure to them but didn’t expect you to show proficiency unless you were assigned that weapon after OSUT, like the M-2 .50 caliber machine gun and M60 7.62mm machine gun for example.\nSo, at the end of the training at our graduation ceremony, they gave me two awards. I received two plaques and Certificates of Achievement: one for High Basic Rifle Marksmanship and another for Light Weapons Skill.\nTL/DR: I received a cheap ass plaque, certificate and two free beers!\nDOL",

    "title": "What was the most gruesomely effective melee weapon in history",
    "answers": {
      "1": "The Spear.\nTotally not kidding. The spear is so wickedly effective that everyone used it. So much so that it seems boring and pedestrian. But consider, the spear was, far and away, the dominant weapon of humanity right up until guns took over.",
      "2": "The first answer must be the spear, in its different guises, ie. throwing spear, probably the oldest version, still used in Africa for hunting, the 2 meters common spear, the longer pike. The main reason of its unique effectiveness lies in the small training required and in its uniquely low cost. A spear needs a very small amount of iron, and even a point made of fire-hardened wood can kill an unarmoured opponent.\nIt was the weapon of choice of poorer tribes, like European “barbarians”, and of the poorer social classes, that formed the bulk of ancient infantry.\nIn the form of the pike, it was still used in Ireland in 1798, and by sans-culotte militias in the French revolution.\nContrast this with the sword, a very effective and ancient weapon. Much more metal is needed, more specialized craftsmen and a resulting much higher cost. But crucially, a sword that is not of the highest quality has a much decreased effectiveness. It also requires much more training and a higher morale of the swordsman in comparison with the spearman, who can seek comfort in numbers and in the stand-off nature of his weapon.\nA second very effective weapon is the sling. It can kill at a distance, even an enemy entrenched or in cover. It could be used by the poorest or by young teenagers, who could learn the art of war at a safe distance from enemy warriors. It costs literally nothing and when using stones as missiles, its ammunition is infinite. When using lead projectiles, as in Greek and Roman armies, the cost increases, but its precision and range also dramatically increase and its effectiveness becomes so terrible that even iron helmets and armour can't save the enemy. Just remember David and Goliath.\nToday the spear can be an AK-47 and the sling an IED, an improvised explosive device, or “roadside bomb”. Ask the Taliban, ISIS or world-wide militias.",
      "3": "Gruesome and Effective…. you mean like the best balance between those 2 ?\nHmm… a Billhook i would say\nImagine someone thrusts at your Leg but missed… and you think “damn that was close!” and while you think that the sharpened hook starts to cut into your Achilles tendons and suddenly you lie on the Floor… and then this Weapon comes toward you again, stabs you in the groin with the Point and cuts up your femoral Arteries with the Hooks… and you think “damn this hurts… why all get black now?” and then you die … from 2 Quick Motions… definately more brutal then a simple Spear but in all other regards as much or more effective\nAfter some Peasants gutted alot of Knights on Horseback with their tool versions during some Riot in England , the Billhook quick became a military Weapon. The Tool Versions are thought to harvest and prune Fruit Trees without a ladder from the ground",
      "4": "The Spear.\nI'm completely serious. The spear was incredibly efficient, and virtually everyone relied on it. It may seem ordinary and unremarkable now, but if you think about it, the spear reigned supreme as humanity's primary weapon until firearms became prevalent.",
      "5": "There is a historical law that states that the final or perfect expression of a weapon will appear just as it becomes obscolescent. From this law we can deduce that the ultimate melee weapons appeared when firearms started taking over, i.e. during the Renaissance.\nThat leaves us with the halberd.\nIt is very much the perfect melee weapon, having the power and reach of a two handed weapon while still being more manageable than a pike or even a spear. It allows for all forms of attack including slashing, cutting, thrusting, and pulling. It combines the spear, axe, and sword.\nPictured: Landsknecht halberdiers. These were the last generation of foot soldiers to rely on melee weapons as their main armament, before Spanish arquebusiers literally blew the old order to pieces at Bicocca in 1522.",
      "6": "When it comes to gruesome effectiveness in melee combat, the medieval flail is often considered one of the most fearsome weapons in history. The flail consists of a wooden handle with a chain attached to it, ending in a spiked metal ball. Its design allowed for powerful and unpredictable swings, making it difficult for opponents to defend against. The spikes could cause devastating injuries upon impact, making it a truly gruesome weapon on the battlefield. However, it's essential to remember that the effectiveness of a weapon is determined by the skill of the wielder and the circumstances of the combat.",
      "7": "All melee weapons are gruesome.\nSo, how do we measure most effective?\nIf we measure in terms of the total number of lives lost in the widest range of circumstances, the answer is probably the knife. Knives have been everywhere. Unlike many other melee weapons, knives can be concealed. Knives can be used indoors, in close quarters, et cetera. Knives are easy to carry when your main weapon is a gun. Knives are just easy to carry. And they’re enough to be deadly.\nIf you want to think about superior killing potential without having any ranged weapons available, you want to look at a larger weapon. This starts with spears… but what’s more effective than a long pointy stick is a long pointy stick with bonus functionality. This gets you into polearms in general, which can generally be thought of as upgraded spears. Poleaxes, halberds, swordstaffs… or quite possibly an actual two-handed sword, which also has quite a bit of reach and is really quite deadly.\nBut that’s all circumstantial. We can identify some weapons as simply better by technology - a steel-tipped spear is better than one tipped with flint, certainly - and some designs of weapon were creatively inspired but not particularly effective, such as various farming tools repurposed as weapons. However, many weapons are simply effective in a different domain.\nWarhammers, for example. Warhammers are really quite handy for dealing with good armor. They’ve been around for a couple thousand years, and they were getting more popular towards the end of the armored era. They might not have the reach of, say, a spear, but they’re very effective in circumstances where many other weapons are not very effective, i.e., dealing with opponents wearing very good armor.\nImage from 1\n2\n3\n4",
      "8": "While many melee weapons could be argued to be the most gruesomely effective on a battlefield, an argument could easily be made for the claymore two handed sword. It was a deadly weapon and a devastating tool on the battlefield. With their average length falling to around 51 inches long, the claymore offered a mid-ranged combat style and the combined length, dual handed wielding, and weight meant that the claymore could easily sever limbs or even decapitate with a single blow. The claymore was far more nimble than weapons like a pike and better standoff distance than a mace.",
      "9": "The Spear. Why?\n1. It provides its user with standoff distance to both defend and attack.\n2. It is cheap to make.\n3. It doesn't require alot of time training to be used effectively.\nThe spear was arguably man's first melee weapon. Likely over 300,000 years old. It was an equalizer for prehistoric man as both defense from larger dangerous predators and offense to hunt faster and larger prey. Man would quickly use this weapons fighting other men.\nThe spear's longevity in military history is nothing short of legendary. The spear was used throughout prehistory to the modern era. Spears were still in use during the gunpowder era well into the 20th century. Even today, modern combat rifles are often equipped with a bayonet, which is basically a modern fancy spear.\nSo yeah, they are technically still around in an era of nukes, drones, artillery, tanks, and heavy machine guns.",
      "10": "First, all combat is gruesome. Until we can field a disintegrator gun that leaves no bodies behind, or some kind of neural disruptor that just stops the heart, that part isn’t changing.\nSpear. Everyone used it, and they all look pretty much alike. They might come into different sizes, and have different features, but you’ve got a shaft with a pointy bit at one end. We’ve used them for millennia and we still use it- modern rifles are a little on the short side for bayonets, but it it is a shaft with a pointy bit.",
      "11": "The War Hammer: The war hammer was a medieval weapon designed to penetrate armor. It had a spiked head on one side and a hammer on the other, allowing it to pierce armor with the spike and then deliver a powerful blow with the hammer.\nThe Katana: The katana is a traditional Japanese sword that was used by samurai warriors. It is known for its sharpness and versatility in combat, as well as its ability to deliver quick, deadly strikes.\nThe Mace: The mace was a medieval weapon that was designed to crush armor and bones. It had a heavy head made of metal or stone and was used to bludgeon opponents.\nThe Flail: The flail was a medieval weapon that consisted of a spiked metal ball attached to a chain. It was used to deliver powerful blows from a distance and was particularly effective against armored opponents.\nThe Halberd: The halberd was a medieval weapon that combined the features of an axe and a spear. It had a long shaft and a blade on one end, allowing it to be used for both slashing and thrusting attacks.",
      "12": "This is clearly an opinion focused question not factual, and therefore you will not receive the same common answer but rather opinions.\nSo again this is just personnal opinion but for me the the cutlass and the the japanese Katana sword",
      "13": "There are many different opinions about the most terribly effective melee weapon in history. However, many sources state that the katana sword used by the Japanese samurai is one of the most effective melee weapons1. The katana is a light and sharp sword used by samurai in war and in daily life1",
      "14": "The word: “Melee” generally refers to a close, hand-to-hand struggle or battle, usually with multiple combatants. In this context, I can rule out weapons such as gatling guns, land mines or even grenades, since they are designed to use from a distance, and not in the middle of a fight. So in this context, we are really looking for a personal, hand-operated weapon.\nSwords, knives, clubs, mace (a type of weighted spiked club,) war hammer, battleax and other things like this come to mind. However, the most effective is most likely a simple semi-automatic pistol, such as a 1911.\nA pistol is relatively lightweight, easy to control, causes immediate and devastating damage to the victim, when used properly, can be reloaded almost instantly, and two or more can be carried at once.",
      "15": "One could argue for the bayonet, especially ones designed to create star pattern or triangular wounds.",
      "16": "The big double bladed ax.\nIt takes a lot of strength to wield it effectively but in the hands of a strong and skilled warrior it can cause more damage and gore than pretty much any other melee weapon.",
      "17": "You are thinking that a weapon will do all the work, as if possession would make the wielder automatically some sort of death dealer.\nWeapons only work when the user is well trained so that he doesn't hurt himself, his mates, and then can kill or incapacitate the enemy.\nIn terms of “effective”, spear-type weapons are the most effect because they are easy to use and take less energy to thrust compared to swinging an axe or sword around. This is why every army of every era had “spearmen” types as their primary soldiers.\nIf you want “gruesome”, then probably any 2-handed cutting weapon from halberds to glaives, including 2-handed swords designed to hack through armor. These would be capable of cleaving heads and cutting from the shoulder down to the hip of even the best armored enemies. But these take a lot of strength and training which is why they never existed in large numbers on the battlefield."

It is a deep-fried dough stick that is long and golden-brown, typically crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.\nHere's a basic description of Chinese YouTiao:\nIngredients:\nAll-purpose flour\nWater\nSalt\nBaking powder\nPreparation:\nDough Preparation: YouTiao dough is made by mixing all-purpose flour, water, salt, and sometimes baking powder. The ingredients are combined to form a smooth, elastic dough.\nResting: The dough is allowed to rest for a period, typically a few hours or overnight. This resting process helps develop the dough's texture and flavor.\nShaping: After resting, the dough is rolled out into a rectangular shape and cut into strips. The strips are then stretched and twisted to create the characteristic shape of YouTiao.\nFrying: The prepared YouTiao is deep-fried in hot oil until it becomes golden brown and crispy. The frying process gives it a delightful crunch on the outside while retaining a soft interior.\nYouTiao is commonly served in pairs and is often enjoyed with a bowl of soy milk or congee (rice porridge) for breakfast. It can also be eaten as a snack or paired with other dishes. Its savory and slightly salty flavor makes it a versatile treat that can be enjoyed in various ways.\nIn some regions, YouTiao may have different names or variations in ingredients and preparation, but it remains a beloved street food and breakfast staple throughout China and other parts of Asia.",

      "1": "I can only answer where I worked. That was California in the prison system.\nWhy is the food in jail always so horrible?\nIt isn’t what I call horrible. It’s just tasteless and it has lots of water.\nLike a school lunch.\nIt’s tasteless because the State serves a “Heart Healthy” diet. Its low in salt, and fat. If an inmate eats everything on their plate, they in fact get the recommended 2,000 calories per day with the recommended amount of vitamins protein and minerals.\nThere is no requirement the meals be tasty.\nIt also has water in a lot of the food items. That is because the way the food is prepared. Its called “Cook Chill.”\nAlmost the meals are prepared in a single large central kitchen, put into cold storage and then kept until mealtime. The food is then shipped out to satellite kitchens where it is heated up, for serving.\nThe food is put into deep pans. Water is added to the food to allow heat from the steam line to be transferred to the food. Again, just like a school lunch.\nOne more thing. The State serves what is a standardized menu so they can order items in bulk. This allows the food buyers to acquire items nearing expiration. Like for example, 10,000 Turkey loaves, or 50,000 apples.\nWhen staff an inmates agree on something I do think its worth noting. I agree the food is NOT particularly good, and certainly would not like to have to live off of that day in and day out.",

      "4": "The stuff that most citizens eat in their everyday life is crap. McDonalds, processed foods, etc. I’m not sure what they serve in jail, and I suspect it depends much on which jail or penitentiary. But let’s be realistic. Some people eat crap every day and others eat rather gourmet, and many eat somewhere in between. But someone in jail deserves food that meets basic nutritional needs and nothing more. Let’s face it, that is more than many people outside of jail have access to.",
      "5": "It depends on how wealthy the state or county your in. Usually the inmates cook the food, and if it's a poor county they might not have much to work with. I have been to counties that had little old ladies that came in and cooked us three meals a day. Bless their hearts! If ever see one of them on the streets. They would get the biggest hug from me!

    "answers": {
      "1": "At the zoo I worked in we had contacts all over the meat industry so we got nearly all the meat we needed for the predators for next to nothing. Most of it was unsellable off cuts and internal organs. Wild cats have extremely robust stomach systems which can break down raw meat without being harmed by the bacteria which cooking removes.\nI saw a documentary once which showed a group of lions consuming a warthog in an advanced state of putrefaction which they had fished out of a water hole in which it had drowned.\nEdit - something I will add. It is important to feed the wild cats everything - meat, muscle, sinew, bone, gristle, the whole lot - all raw. You can’t just give them the good stuff which humans eat.\nBelow - lion with a corpse which is well past its best before date:",
      "2": "It’s usually cow meat or chicken. It terms of raw in general their stomach acids are better or are more acclimated to consuming raw meat. The truth is humans can consume raw beef (not chicken) if they have the stomach enzymes to properly kill off harmful bacteria.\nSome humans do in fact eat raw beef and fish without frequent trips to the E.R. A steak that is prepared rare or medium rare is in fact raw meat in the center.\nThe risk of humans eating raw chicken (and eggs) is too high in terms of salmonella poisoning. We just don’t have the enzymes to process that safely. We may have at one point in our evolution, but definitely not now.",
      "3": "Like this\nThose are young ones, they practice biting the throat.\nThey get from various sources animals hit by cars, in general animals slaughtered, sometimes even other animals from the zoo.\nIn Helsinki there is a problem with wild rabbits. Those are killed and fed to the lions.",

    "title": "Most likely which country will be the next prey of Russia after Ukraine",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Any country that borders Russia. Right now Belarus and the Baltic's seem like the next on the hit list\nBelarus prepares for hybrid war against Russia\nU.S. Lending Support to Baltic States Fearing Russia\n-from a Pro Russian rag publication",
      "2": "Any former Soviet country, that will have a transition of power, with new leader not pledging his support towards Russia. Here and later in the text by Russia i don’t mean, that country per se, but Putin and other Russian leaders with military/secret-service background.\nBasically once Russian leadership will start losing political control over the leader of the country, the invasion is possible. That was the case in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia. The easiest prey are the countries where Russian military bases are already established and/or had some conflicts involving Russia in the past - so Belarus, Tajikistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan and to lesser extent Kazakhstan.\nNow if we look at the current leaderships - Belarusian and Kazakh leaders are less controlled and less cooperative, but any transition is unlikely, so they will be mainly bought off and dealt behind the closed doors. So even though Russia is mildly threatening with such options (through radical media). In case of death of the leader, Belarus may become unstable, if local secret service will fail to produce the successor quickly. In Kazakhstan all resources are controlled by several clans, so transition may go more smooth there..\nIn Armenia and Azerbaidzhan things may escalate quickly in case of transition of power and Karabakh will be used extensively as a pretext. That is one of the reasons, why Armenian opposition never seriously attacks or criticizes Russia, as they have limited options, given their broken relations with Turkey and Azerbadjan, limited relations with Iran (that often sides with Azerbaidzhan)their only remaining potential ally is Georgia.\nCurrent political climate in Azerbaidzhan is so sterile, that there is not any meaningful opposition for now. Still, if Armenian/Azeri new leadership will fail to show enough “support” towards Russia, it will mainly result in “escalation of the Karabakh conflict”, where Russian military participation will be harder to prove (given their official status as peacekeepers) - so it is up to you to see, whether you can call that a prey.\nMoldova - same story. Transnistria is a result of Russian invasion, and it may escalate at any given time, but it is already part of the previous prey (as is Ukraine).\nIn Tajikistan the situation also looks pretty sterile, and having anti-Russian pro-Islamic leader coming to power is very unlikely, but in case of escalation, the civil war will be used as a pretext as it was used already in 90s\nIn Kyrgyzstan, Atambayev presidential term may expire soon, but any of the sides in the political spectrum do not question the country's membership in the Eurasian Union even though it is economically hazardous to the country.\nBaltic states are also unlikely, as they are members of Nato and EU. Sending troops to Ukraine is one thing, but action against EU/Nato member (as long as EU/Nato exists) may result in payback, which Russia is afraid of. Same goes for other Eastern European EU countries - Russia may buy certain politicians to represent their interests (ATAKA in Bulgaria, Jobbik in Hungary, etc), but is unlikely to participate in the direct military intervention.\nAs for Balkans - it really depends on the situation but special ops, like the recent ones in Montenegro, are more likely, rather then full scale invasion. While situation is not stable in Macedonia, and ethnic Albanian parties may use it as a pretext to pressure for more autonomy, i wouldn’t expect full scale invasion, but more likely a silent weaponry and expert support.\nSo in an nutshell - The best candidate right now is Belarus in case of Lukashenko’s death and secret service failing to produce the successor effectively, while opposition/general public taking more pro European direction.\nThis of course, if we are not counting any meddling in the middle east (like their military intervention in Syria, or several ongoing “projects” in Turkey).",
      "3": "Probably Belarus,Kazakhstan or Mongolia. because they all share borders and have a minority Russian speaking population. These countries are also considered weak on a global scale and strategic for Russia.",
      "4": "After Ukraine, Putin’s regime will have no tooth to bite any other state.",
      "5": "Russians have made a lot of noise about expanding their occupation of Moldova. However, they have failed to penetrate Ukrainian territory far enough to reach Moldova by land.",
      "6": "Probably one of the ones that break off of it when it collapses again.",
      "7": "Belarus\nBelarus has no allies and no friends. Conquering and annexing Belarus would provide Putin with a reinforced aura of being a victorious and therefore true tsar of Russia.",
      "8": "I thought this current invasion of the Ukraine was about not wanting it to join NATO and having nuclear weapons since the Ukraine shares a border with Russia? Can someone confirm or otherwise?",
      "9": "I do not believe in a Belarus Maidan or a revolution there. If there is support for that from other countries these could really get ugly …. I really pray for normalization in Ukraine. I think it’s getting worse. America can not neither support Europe, because I do not really think they want to. The best option is still to get along with Russia. Like America however they have this ‘imperialistic attitude’ which is not fair towards smaller countries. Currently I think Russia lost a lot of business opportunities and lost a lot of its postive reputation. The EU is no bad West , bad just more or less small countries and to much of great Russia really just makes a bad impression.",
      "10": "Our next targets for invasion are Moon, Mars and further along the way Europa, Encelad and Titan.\nOnce there, we'll be moving Europe to orbit Mars to kick start magnetic field and drop a portion of Europe water to refill Mars's channels.\nThat's a short draft of the most realistic Russian invasion plans.",
      "11": "Most likely, which country will be the next prey of Russia after Ukraine?\nAn easy question. Russia will fall to themselves. Russia is Russia’s prey. They have no resources to do what they are attempting to do. Fuck Russia! Long Live Ukraine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "12": "Most likely Chile. It is a little known secret (thats why its little know) that Chile and Russia have a long standing feud.",
      "13": "None because the economy of Russia is headed for a deep depression. They will be lucky to afford toilet paper much less ammunition.\nAdded to the above is that Putin is coming to his end and there will be political problems to sort things out. Their military will be crippled and unable to rebuild to threaten other nations.",
      "14": "After the mess they have made of invading Ukraine, North Korea might be the only one they could fight to a standstill any time soon. They simply do not have the resources to make another advance on a still unharmed military.",
      "15": "Most probably, its next target will be Moldova.\nHe would Justify the war by saying that We are invading Moldova to protect the rights of the Russian minority and to secure the breakaway state of Transnistria.\nBelarusian president Alexander Lukashenko accidentally leaked the Russian plan of invading Moldova during a press conference where he was explaining the Russian plan of Invading Ukraine.\nBut for this plan to work, Russia should have a land corridor to Moldova, It should capture Mykolaiv and Odesa. Otherwise, the plan is useless.",
      "16": "Such a question. So many variables. But as far as any guess can go, I see four reasons why it won’t be Moldova.\nMy two cents (and no more than that):\nIf Russia takes Ukraine that will send a blaring message to the world that NATO is a tootless tiger. It’s military aliance is undefeatable; but if the will is lacking then its military might will mean nothing. This would embolden Russia actually to (quickly and directly) take on a NATO country.\nThroughout all, Belarus has been hanging back. In the event Russia takes Ukraine, Belarus will see some benefit in joining with—let’s face it—its buddy, Russia, in an offensive pact.\nBasically, if (and in cahoots wth Belarus) Russia takes Ukraine then POLAND will stand out as the ripe fruit. By land and sea Poland is exposed to Russia on a full 60% of its borders.\nMoldova is small and strategically insignificant nation, already affected by the Russian occupation of its eastern border region (Transnistria.) If Rusia takes Ukraine it could aford to bypass Moldova completely and “mop it up,” any time it wants.\nAnd—given, again, that NATO has lost its deterrent—if Poland goes, the rest or eastern Europe stands exposed.\nIt all hangs on Ukraine.",
      "17": "It is impossible to say for certain which country will be the next prey of Russia after Ukraine, but there are a few countries that are at higher risk than others. These countries include:\nBelarus: Belarus is a close ally of Russia and shares a long border with Ukraine. It has already been used by Russia as a staging ground for its invasion of Ukraine.\nMoldova: Moldova is a small country located between Romania and Ukraine. It has a breakaway region, Transnistria, which is controlled by Russia-backed separatists.\nPoland and Romania: Poland and Romania are both members of NATO, but they also share borders with Ukraine. They could be targeted by Russia in an attempt to test NATO's resolve.\nIt is important to note that these are just a few of the countries that could be at risk from Russia. Russia has a history of aggression against its neighbors, and it is possible that it could target other countries in the region, such as the Baltic states or the Caucasus region.\nIt is also important to note that Russia's actions in Ukraine are still ongoing, and it is unclear how the war will end. If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it could embolden it to take further military action against other countries. However, if Russia is defeated in Ukraine, it could make it less likely to take further military action.\nUltimately, it is impossible to say for certain which country will be the next prey of Russia. However, the countries listed above are at higher risk than others due to their proximity to Russia and their lack of NATO membership.",
      "18": "The question should be ““What nation will be the next prey of the United States.” We have been constantly at war since World War II. Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Bosnia, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan. I probably missed one or two.",
      "19": "There was leak of information about the plan to attack Lithuania first. There is an idea to restore the USSR borders and even the Warsaw pact borders, which means that Putin intends to surround Russia by the puppet/ friendly countries as he did when he was sitting at the very long table :\nPutin is not mentally sick in a full sense, however he demonstrates schizoid and paranoid behaviour : “ keep as far as possible from me, then I will feel safe”.",
      "20": "Contentious title aside, Belarus is a very pro-Russian country with a tyrant-esque leader, pro-Russian propaganda and media restrictions.\nIf Russia were attempting to re-’Russify’ the ex soviet bloc countries I would imagine Belarus is high on their list of priorities, not that I’m suggesting that’s what they’re trying to do.",
      "21": "It was USA, now that they have succeeded, it will be UK next and then France.\nHeil Putin, the lovely homoerotic boy.",
      "22": "Russia has it's hands full at the moment. I'm pretty sure they'd rather have economic sanctions removed than fight a new war.",
      "23": "Most likely, which country will be the next prey of Russia after Ukraine?\nAny country where UnConstitutional coup would establish fascist nazi dictatorship threatening to genocide russians may be the next in line…Thank you for asking :-) Enjoy the answer…",
      "24": "The Ukrainians need to organise themselves. At the moment the 30 or so oligarchs who own Ukraine as well as the President, vice-president, Prime Minister. Finance Minister etc are not even ethnic Ukrainians.",
      "25": "Ukraine is an aggressive puppet state of USA. Russia is the victim, not the aggressor. I wrote a book on this subject —- PUTIN, RUSSIA & WW III",
      "26": "Your question suggests that Russia is a predator. That means that you are a product of mainstream media propaganda machine. Russia is not looking for expansion, it's just fearful of contraction imposed by NATO.\nRussia conflict with Ukraine will settle soon. Donbas will get a deserved autonomy, as Kyiv gets it back for amnesty to all separatists. Crimea will be leased to Russia for 50 years or so. Russia will pay for that lease in form of reduced energy tariffs to Ukraine.\nI hope that helps.",
      "27": "At first i will say, that Russia is not invading Ukraine. (Give me at least one normal evidence of it) And we are not going to attack anyone except terrorists in Syria. It’s western propaganda about agressive Russians (As always, nothing new) who annex their own neighbors, we are friends with Belarussia and friends with Ukraine (YES) except their nationalists, that’s the only problem. Please, when you listen news don’t believe them at start. Oh, and by the way… Of course, maybe our government supports rebels at Eastern Ukraine (Because we would like them to remove their illegal president), but it doesn’t have any evidence too.",
      "28": "Any Russophobic country who dares to attack Russia should be prepared to become the next Russian prey. In the past we had Hitler, Napoleon, Poland (multiple attempts), Sweden, Yenghis Khan, … a long list. All ended up badly, and became the Russian “prey”. The current list of Russia-haters is long enough - Poland, Czechia, the Baltics, …. Who comes next?",
      "29": "Russia is a peaceful democratic country, no country (including Ukraine) will be Russian “prey”. However the tendencies that their country is going to be “prey” to Russia are usually sounded by anti-democtatic nationalistic freaks, who themselves commit illegal and hostile actions either against Russia, Russian authorities or Russians and are afraid that they will have to answer for their crimes with all the severity of the law."
