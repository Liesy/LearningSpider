    "answers": {
      "1": "Is it true that an Uighur living in Xinjiang has to ask permission to the Chinese government to visit friends?\nWhy does Quora fields such ridiculous questions?\nIs the questioner some kind of mindless moron or is his “question” really a sentiment of his inner projection to want to insult and provoke China and Chinese people?\nIf the quest is genuine, all he has to do is to google the Chinese Constitution and he would have all the answers he needed instead of making a fool of himself.",
      "2": "The accusations are getting more and more ridiculous every day.\nWatch the following video of a market place. If permission is required to visit friends, do you think that Uyghurs would be allowed to go to markets and eating places and open shops to mingle with tourists from all over the world?\nWatch:\nNotice that in this video, Norbiya is trying to encourage tourists to come to Xinjiang. Would that make sense if there is oppression there? Would the government allow tourism with the people being oppressed?",
      "3": "There are at least 13 million Uighurs in Xinjiang and there are far far less government employed personnel there. Therefore the question is not even intelligent.",
      "4": "Yes, yes! it is true. Not only that. They have to apply for permission to talk to their mother, their father, their siblings and even their spouses. It is terrible. They need your help to rescue them. Please don't waste time asking questions on Quora but lobby your government to provide asylum for the 11 million Uighurs.",
      "5": "Now wait a minute, I thought the west was telling us that the “Uighurs” were being “genocided”. If there’s a “genocide” how can there be any friends to visit?",
      "6": "Wait, the narrative of the US and friends was China was terminating the whole ethnic group. Now it is restriction of Uighurs’ free movement? How does this stack up with covid-19 lockdown?\nThe West needs more consistency in their narrative in order to be credible. It does look like the West is throwing some random shit to see which one will stick.",
      "7": "No. My former 48 years old tour manager of Xinjiang , a Uighur, married a Chinese woman, they have 4 kids , the eldest is 15, their kids use to have Chinese schoolfriends sleep over at his family farm of pears and vegetables. His sister runs a restaurant in Yili which serves customers of all nationalities. His family of 6 use to make trips to Huangshan, Guangzhou, Shanghai Disneyland, Beijing, etc for their kids school holidays. In 2019 September, my tour group of 16 from Singapore had lunch in his sister's restaurant in Yili.\nThe Hemu village:\nThe Tourist Chalets in Hemu Village\nThe city of Urumuqi, see the turrets? That's the mosque.",
      "8": "Even for a government as capable as China, it is way too much to set up a permission system for the Uighurs to visit each other. Moreover, a capable government must also be a smart government, who would not be so stupid to do such nonsense.",
      "9": "“Is it true that an Uighur living in Xinjiang has to ask permission to the Chinese government to visit friends ?”\nIf you have read the above from any western media, then you have the right to believe it is true. The CCP control every aspect of Uyghur life, the also need permission to breath, to eat, to take shower or to toilet.\nThe Xinjiang/Uyghur allegation is getting more absurd day by day.\nThe number of Uyghur locked up in concentration camp grow from 2 hundred thousand to a million within 2 years. And Lately, the number has gone up to 3 million+. And people believe there is a facility somewhere in XJ that can hold up 3 million people ??? !!! Anyway, don’t be surprise if the number grow to 100% of total Uyghur population in the next 2 to 3 years.\nI think one’s IQ score will get lower the more he/she read Uyghur’s new from the West media. This question is the evident.",
      "10": "If it’s a real question.\nAnswer: No, or who is to grant permission and supervise the friend visiting application?? Because there must be someone doing that for full job, as there are 13 million of Uighur people.\nDid the person told you this mention some details? How long do they have to wait? Is it a printed certificate or just a code? one time or multiple access? it there time limit? one person or apply as family? has location limit? Uighur only or some other minorities have to do the same? online application or go to a place to submit paper? …\nIf there are details, you can find out truth quickly. Just like bullshit forced labor picking cottons, why don’t the western propaganda machine to post some real evidences like satellite image of massive forced labor doing works? or photo of torture, rape, sterilization, etc, but just clips of shooting a building in car, testimonial and accusation with horror BGM, Because there’s no evidence of it.\nWhy can some people be fooled that easily.\nIf it’s not\nAnswer: No, they are in camps, or genocide, or forced picking cottons, choose your favorite one.",
      "11": "I can provide some details.\nUighurs in Xinjiang are free to move around, although there will be stricter security checks in Xinjiang and curfews exist in certain areas.\nForeigners or people from other regions can freely travel to Xinjiang.\nIn China, all long-distance transportation requires an ID card, and the race is marked on Chinese ID cards. If Uighurs need to leave Xinjiang, they must obtain permission similar to a visa.\nUsually Uighurs do not have passports unless they have valid reasons and get permission.\nSo the answer to this question depends on whether his friends and relatives live outside of Xinjiang. If so, he indeed needs to obtain permission.",
      "12": "I sincerely believe that you had been inundated by Western propagandas until you had no way of knowing if what you had read was true or not.\nMost answers would tell you that it is untrue but I am not going to tell you that, instead, I just wanted to tell you how to double confirm any bizarre news that you had came across. Try to search for such news from US and China neutral countries. Off hand I can say that both New Zealand and Singapore should qualify as basically neutral towards US as well as China. If you can't find your bizarre news being published by medias of those countries then chances are your country's medias had published rubbish that could not pass the concentiousness of editors in those neutral countries to be republished.\nActually my country, Malaysia, should be US-China neutral too but I did not quote just in case if you might think that we are not advanced enough for you.",
      "13": "No, whether you are a Chinese or a foreigner, you can travel to Xinjiang freely. There is an old Chinese saying that I hear others say a hundred times. It is better to go and see it by myself（百闻不如一见）. Therefore, I welcome foreign friends to see the real Xinjiang.",
      "14": "I was in charge of the a subsidiary company's in Chile. We had a very small business with less than 10 people here, due to the economic downturn, the regional bosses in Mexico decided to tighten the budget and require that all expenses must be approved by Mexico (before within a certain amount, the subsidiaries of each country can make their own decisions), and then the people in Mexico find out they went to crazy, they have to process huge applications every day, so they give up this stupid decision after one week.\nNow let's take a look, how many people in Xinjiang?",
      "15": "No",

      "19": "Foolish question over and over again…\nUygur people in China have all rights permitted by the Constitution and Laws.\nThey aren't troubled by out-of-control crimes and Covid-19.\nThey choose to work and get educated to get rid of poverty instead of drowning themselves in drug abuse and terrorism (That’s what American want).\nThey won't be kneed to death like George Floyd.\nThey live a much happier and safer life than ANY minority of the USA.\nAnd of course, more dignity.",
      "20": "Bravissimo, the questions are getting more and more stupid as the accusers no longer have plausible evidence for all of their lies.\nApart from repeating over and over again the allegations of this so-called expert who ridiculed himself by lying about forced labor and donation post on North Face shoes made in Vietnam and as the truth is still breaking out his Twitter message has gone viral on his lies .\nHappy to seen after genocided the 2millions Uighurs they can now visit friends (lmao)\nWe look forward to the next lies they will invent again to make fun of themselves once again"

      "1": "Yes. I used to keep a budgerigar at home. One night , several hours after I came home from school , I was playing games on my computer when my parrot starder making weird noises and was a upset. I was concerned about him so I left him out from his cage because he loved to stand on my head believe it or not, and I thought it would calm him down. He continued to do so , when I noticed that the glass of water left on the table was shaking (I mean the water inside of it was shaking). I was like this is pretty weird and it stopped after about ten minutes. After that , my budgie was calm and returned to it's normal state. It turned out that there was a minor 3.3 magnitude earthquake in my area.",
      "2": "When I lived on the west coast USA. At one point I had a python ( who grew to 26 feet before I had to find a new home for it) and the day before we had an earthquake it always stood straight up the wall with as little of its tail on the floor as possible. It would just stay that way all day and night. If I took it down it would return. It did it about twenty times during the 8 years I had it, and it was always the day before and day of an earth quake.",
      "3": "As a geologist who worked with seismologists on earthquake hazards, and as someone who has or has had several cats, dogs, and donkeys, I can contribute some insights.\nIn the months to hours before a fault ruptures releasing the enormous energy we call an earthquake, there is a build up of microfracturing. There have been a number of verified reports of animals who have reacted to these microtremors, including elephants, rats, snakes. For example, elephants in Phuket were agitated and insisted on moving to higher ground before the 2004 earthquake and tsunami. Rats came out of the buildings and fled before the 1976 Tien Shan quakes.\nSome studies that detect electrical or magnetic changes on the ground can be detected by animals.\nSo, animals do not predict earthquakes before they start, exactly, but rather respond like super sensitive seismometers to microquakes that people cannot feel.",
      "4": "By god's grace,have never faced the issue of earthquakes or tsunamis yet, however in 2006, I have seen worst flood of my life.\nMy apartment which is on ground floor was submerged in water for 3 days and all people from ground floor shifted to rooms in upper floor for time being.\nI remembered my neighbour had a cat who gave birth to kittens some 25 days ahead of flood. Everyday, she used to sit on one place along with kittens and we feed her day and night for she being new mother but a day before the flood she just vanished along with her kittens and returned with all her kittens unharmed after situations got normal.\nI found it strange and also the day when water started rising and it was heavy rainfall, hardly I could see street dogs or birds, usually during normal rains they take shelter here and there but they day almost 90% of animal population relocated to safer place as if they knew about this disaster beforehand.",
      "5": "1977, following a whopping 7 richter earthquake in the Persian Gulf, we dove far out into the mountains but on an open flat area to avoid danger. I watched an ant go round and round in circles, thinking how weird it was as ants always seem to have a plan. Then a huge noisy tremor struck, rocks falling from the mountain sides and goats racing downhill. We made it home, avoiding rocks on the road, passing villagers who prayed beside the rubble of their broken shacks.\nDid the ants perceive something that disorientated them? Maybe. Anyhow they are easier to observe than snakes.",
      "6": "Bird, particularly parrot's hav been known to get quite upset before, during and after even very slight earthquakes. I live with an African Grey male who is particularly sensitive but doesn't have the words to properly articulate what he senses. The other is a macaw that practically latch herself to me and tell me ‘thete is a problem coming’. Not great but enough to indicate our safety may be at risk.\nI live in the Midwest and we've had a couple of very mild quakes that we barely felt if at all but the parrot's did.",
      "7": "I live in Maryland, so not exactly earthquake central, but one night my cat was sleeping on my bed with me. She woke up so abruptly that it woke me up too. She was looking around back and forth like she was looking at something, then very imperceptibly I could feel some shaking. The next day on the news they reported a small earthquake. If she hadn’t woken me up I probably would have slept through it. Most people I know didn’t even notice it because it happened at like 3 or 4 am and wasn’t very strong.",
      "8": "Yes. They hear or feel them before we do.\nIn a giant tsunami in the Pacific in re ent history the animals started heading up the hill sides to higher ground. The people who notice followed them and were saved.",
      "9": "Its been known for a long time that animals will behave different before a natural disaster. Their senses are much better than ours. They can hear and feel what we can’t. The ground rumbling from a quake animals can feel and hear. Wildlife will start running in the same direct to get away from something we have no idea that is about to happen. When your dog starts acting cray, barking and just strange, pay attention, the dog knows something you don’t. In the tsunami videos before it hits shore, you can hear the dogs barking crazy long before the tsunami arrives. The birds know it too.",
      "10": "No. But many animals can sense frequencies above and/or below what we can. By the time we can hear or feel an earthquake, they may have already sensed it and reacted. So next time you see a whole bunch of animals suddenly running away, figure something is going on and do likewise.",
      "11": "I think they can. Like me I can smell when it's going to ☔🌧️ and when the seasons change and more..",
      "12": "There isn’t any conclusive evidence they can. If there were then similar to keeping canaries in coal mines other animals would be kept in similar type of early warning systems.\nWhat they probably can is feels the effects of an upcoming disaster quicker than humans simply because in general many animals particularly those who live in the wild have much better senses than humans do. Therefore they feel the early effects of the impending disasters\nA few year ago before a major hurricane was supposed to hit my area I took walk while it was still relatively calm before the storm. It was a windy day but nothing so out of the ordinary. Yet when I reached the foot trail in the forest I saw the deer were absolulty frantic, running to and fro with no idea where to run. They couldn’t possibly have been aware of the impending hurricane but they clearly sensed some sort of CURRENT abnormality in the climate causing their frenzy",
      "13": "No. No animal has any concept of a natural disaster, it being an earth quake or a tsunami. And nothing and nobody can predict a future, since it does not exist yet.\nThat said, it seems true that some animals sense subtle phenomena that possibly occur in nature, prior to a natural disaster, that we humans haven't noticed nor measured yet. This sense then must have developed during the millions of years of evolution of the species.\nThis is pure speculation of course, but worth investigating.",
      "14": "My dog was & were confuses when they first experienced natural disaster.\nOnce was before an earthquake they were restless for several 1–2 days upon an earthquake, keep circling around the room and whining looking for their human. It was a relatively medium (5.6SR with 19km depth epicentrum of ±50km from house &4.3SR of aftershock ) earthquake but after that there’re some small /subtle earthquake several years but they didn’t react no more, or maybe i just didn’t pay much attention as i didn’t even feel much difference bc either it’s faraway and it’s too depth below the surface.\nThe other time was when a small typhoon comes, prior before raining that evening my dogs were restless and whining, running towards the screened window and keep barking.\nThe whines, barks, and circlings were done after the events pass. Well , we never had much natural disaster as we lived in places with geographically low natural disaster, so there weren’t much occurence to guess if it’s coincidence or they did able to predict. I personally believe they have better senses than us, especially when our brain cognitive function are almost always overloaded with daily tasks and stuff like money, or chores or jobs or kids or how to make more money, lol. Not to mention social media influence nowadays or when we sleep like dead ,unlike human our furfriend stay strict to their duty to help themself and their pack to check their surrounding always.",

      "1": "It totally depends from person to person. Some people find difficulty in sleeping after eating eggs at night but some feel energized and full. The main point is you should eat anything 2 to 3 hours even though it's eggs or something else before going to bed then it doesn’t have any negative effects nor cause any digestive issues. But it is Highly recommended to eat eggs in the morning to get the best results from it.",
      "2": "There's no specific health-related reason to avoid eating eggs at night. Eggs are a nutritious source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and they can be consumed at any time of the day without causing harm. However, there might be a few reasons why some people choose not to eat eggs at night:\n1. **Digestive Concerns:** Some individuals may experience digestive discomfort or indigestion if they consume heavy or high-fat foods before bedtime. Eggs can be relatively rich in fat, so if someone is prone to digestive issues, they might avoid them at night.\n2. **Personal Preferences:** Dietary choices are often influenced by personal preferences and cultural habits. Some people prefer lighter meals in the evening and may opt for foods they associate with dinner or bedtime snacks.\n3. **Sleep Quality:** There's a belief that consuming foods high in protein before bedtime might disrupt sleep for some individuals. However, this effect can vary from person to person, and it's not solely attributed to eggs.\n4. **Traditional Eating Patterns:** Cultural or traditional dietary practices can influence when specific foods are consumed. In some cultures, eggs are more commonly eaten during breakfast or lunch.\nUltimately, whether or not to eat eggs at night is a matter of personal choice, dietary preferences, and individual tolerance. If you enjoy eggs and they don't cause you any discomfort or disrupt your sleep, there's no inherent reason to avoid them as an evening snack or part of your dinner. Just be mindful of portion sizes and overall dietary balance.",
      "3": "Some people avoid eating eggs at night due to concerns about potential digestion issues and the belief that protein-rich foods like eggs might interfere with sleep. However, there's no one-size-fits-all rule, and it varies based on individual preferences and digestion. 🥚🌜"

If he’d been unusually dark or pale, that would have set him apart.\nAt the time and place, “ordinary” would have meant sort of brown-ish, with brown eyes.\nThis is a forensic reconstruction of a typical man from Galilee or Judea in the 1st century CE.

Neither group got along well with Jews, but it only stands to reason that there was some genetic mixing.\nSo, Jesus (if he even existed) might have had some ‘white’ genes, but in all probability he just had the same skin color as everyone else in the area.

McGrew: One Secret About Jesus Which The Christians Do Not Know\nONE SECRET ABOUT JESUS WHICH THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT KNOW James H. McGrew\n“Most historians believe that Jesus died on the cross. The Muslim tradition, however, teaches that Jesus did not die on the cross and died in India years after the crucifixion. The Muslim tradition was correct. Baba clarifies that Jesus did not die on the cross and in fact did travel to India after the crucifixion and is now buried there: \"There is one secret about Jesus which the Christians do not know. When Jesus was crucified, he did not die; he entered the state of Nirvikalp Samadhi (the \"I Am God\" state without bodily consciousness). On the third day, he again became conscious of his body and he traveled secretly in disguise eastward (with some apostles) to India. This was called Jesus' resurrection . \"After reaching India, he traveled farther east to Rangoon in Burma where he remained for some time. He then went north to Kashmir where he settled. When his work was finished on earth, he dropped his body and entered Nirvikalp Samadhi permanently. \"Saints in India have verified these facts about Jesus' travels. Mankind will soon become aware of the true life about Jesus.\" In 1933, Baba showed some Western disciples a hill in Harvan, Northeast of Srinagar in Kashmir State, India, and told them: \"There is the place where two of Christ's apostles, Bartholomew and Thaddeus, buried his body; they had accompanied him from Palestine.\" Baba had previously stayed in seclusion and fasted on that very hill. Bhau Kalchuri notes: \"Whenever Meher Baba returned to Srinagar, for his own reasons, he went to the Harvan mountain village near the area where Jesus's body was buried in a cave nearly twenty centuries ago. Baba did not actually show the cave to his men and women mandali, because after viewing the area one observes that the cave was probably covered over by avalanches and the natural growth of the mountain terrain.

      "14": "Nowadays, some Middle Easterners are white but that was not the case when Jesus was born. It was only after white people moved to the Middle East in the 12th century that white people lived there. That was over a millennium after Jesus was born. So, it is not possible for him to be white as you need white in your genes to give birth to a white baby. It is technically possible for two non-white parents to give birth to a white baby if both have white in their genes but since the Middle Easterners didn’t reproduce with any white people yet, none of them had white in their genes to pass down to Jesus. Even if God is white and his genes were passed into Jesus, Jesus would only be half-white."

      "1": "Hi, Sinkei428. Thanks for the interesting question!\nI don’t need electricity because I can get most things done by manipulating my qi.\nI travel to work on my wooden sword - I can use my qi to make the sword fly in the air, and I ride it just like how you would ride a surfboard while surfing at the beach, except I do my surfing on the air currents.\nOn a much narrower “surfboard”.\nIn case you were wondering, yes, I get to wear shorts to work.\nCheck out the view on my way to work:\nI don’t have electricity, so I don’t get Netflix and Prime TV, but that’s okay, because I spend most of my time traveling.\nNo need for flight or train tickets when you know how to use your qi to greatly boost your vertical and horizontal jump.\nSince I don’t have electricity, I don’t spend any time gaming or watching telly.\nI get to spend time with family and friends.\nSome of my best friends are red pandas, and they don’t need electricity too.\nA good book will keep their attention for hours.\nMine as well.\nAlso, I don’t need electricity to cook.\nI have gas.\nBut hey, there will be times where I don’t even need to cook.\nThe cat will sometimes get in one of her moods and cook up a storm:\nThen we sit around a round wooden table and enjoy our meal, chatting (or meowing) the night away.\nNo electricity needed!\nHope that helps with your question!\nCheers!",
      "2": "Your lack of knowledge would be laughable if it wasn't so sad. Very near to 100% of households in China have electricity.\nAs an interesting aside, China's mobile services include near-zero “no signal” areas anywhere (i.e. elevators, parking garages, tunnels, rural villages, mountain parks, etc. almost all have mobile service), whereas, in the USA for example, people deal with “no signal” areas all over the country (even in some parts of major cities), which has been that way for years, with little-to-no improvement effort made on the part of either carriers or government….",
      "3": "This is a good question. We Chinese don't need to rely on electricity to live or to eat. We rely on chi, and we absorb the essence of the sun and moon through our connection with nature. Our goal is to become immortals. This is something foreigners can't understand. And of course you don't need to know about China. Because we are mystics.",

      "9": "Because using electricity is considered as treason in China.\nThe electricity is invented by the capitalist country, so the party won’t allow us to use it. Every Chinese gets a panda when they turn 18, but if you use electricity, then you won’t have one. Ana we need the panda. It’s our one and only government issued (black and white) photo id. Without them, we won’t be able to access our government funded medical insurance and 401k.\nSo no, China, in general, does not have electricity. What we do have, is something called replictricity, a cheap knockoff of the electricity. Is it legal? You may ask. And it’s probably not. But copyright is practically nonexistent in China so it’s alright. I mean who’s gonna sue us really?\nAnd this is probably why TikTok is being banned in the US. The product is developed originally in China using replictricity, once hooked into the electricity network, will generate a dangerous virus and attack all your government databases. The US government had figured it out eventually, but it’s too late, we’ve already got all we need. Soon enough our national flag will rise on the roof of the White House.\nHail Hydra. I mean China.",

      "5": "This thing is made in the Qing dynasty, it’s nicknamed “the mother of all Chinese ceramics”(瓷母) What it achieves is to apply every Chinese ceramic technique into the making of one object. Normally, Chinese ceramics would be officially classified by their glazing techniques, like “red glazed ware”, “green glazed ware”. But this piece is so decorated that it’s official name is “All kinds of glaze ware” (各种釉彩大瓶)\nMind you, every color of glaze has a different chemical mix. Every piece has to be fired at different temperatures and be fired in different kilns. Once finished, the different pieces would have to be sent to the Palace and be fired again to make the complete ware. Then you do the brush work and then you fire it again. All in all, this vase has 15 layers of glaze to go through. Every picture on this piece carries heavy symbolic meaning that would take hours to explain. This piece is undoubted the pinnacle of technical achievement in the history of ceramics.\nBut this is not the most Chinese thing ever. The most Chinese thing ever is how the Chinese actually regard this piece. They call it UGLY and UNNATURAL. In fact, it is even called an abomination. The effort put into this piece is too obvious, the beauty too shallow. Therefore, this piece is not actually highly regarded besides its technicality.\nNow this is a different story. On this Song Dynasty ware, a leaf was carefully laid over the still wet glaze and fired in the kiln. The leaf burns away but leaves its shadow permanently onto the ceramic. Therefore one instant becomes eternal, and the nature of reality is imprinted onto the vessel itself. This piece is not only beautiful by itself, but also because of what it has to say about nature and the impermanence of it all.\nAnd I think, to value the latter piece over the former is the most Chinese thing of all.",
      "6": "The most Chinese thing is:\nwe can make all things looks like Chinese.",
      "7": "Before I ever went to China or started to learn Mandarin Chinese, I knew about such Chinese icons as pandas, kung fu, and Confucius.\nHere are some things I’ve learned about since arriving in China and now consider to be extremely Chinese, even though I never knew of them before:\n-1-\nFIGHTING OVER THE BILL AT A RESTAURANT\nWould you like separate checks, or all together?”\nAnyone who has eaten in a North American restaurant knows this question from the waiter or waitress. When the plates have been taken away and it’s time to pay the bill, payment usually happens separately. It’s quite rare, unless it’s an office dinner or lunch, for one single individual to pay the bill at a restaurant.\nIn English, you can say “Go Dutch” to describe sharing the bill.\nHowever, in China, it’s a bit different. Once someone at the table has called “买单(mǎi dān) check please!”, things tend to get a bit complicated. There is often a verbal and sometimes physical wrestling match\nover who pays the bill. And, in general, it’s not fighting over not paying the bill, it’s a fight over who has the privilege of paying the entire bill. In China, you will not be paying the bill if you are:\n• visiting from out of town\n• attending a “thank you” dinner\n• an outsider in the group that has invited you out\n• in the lower rank of a company\n• you’ve received an obvious “let me buy you a dinner” invitation that you’ve responded to\nIn China, “going Dutch” is seen as stingy, or bad manners.\n-2-\nTHE ABILITY TO NAP ANYWHERE\nThe Chinese are famously hard-working. They also tend to wake up early. This combination means that you’ll see people squeezing in naps throughout the day. Taxi drivers snoozing in alleys, waiters dozing off on breaks, businessmen nodding off in the subway. Throughout high-pace, busy China, the people stop for some shuteye whenever they can, even in the middle of a crowded street.\n-3-\nGETTING HAMMERED AT BUSINESS MEETINGS AND SPECIAL EVENTS\nI’ve lived in China for over a year now. My classmates in Beijing and I would sometimes go out on weekends. Usually, we would have dinner and maybe find a bar that was similar to what we knew back home. Usually, we could sit at the bar, have a beer or two\n, stand up and move around, and meet other people. It was familiar to the styles of our home countries, but not exactly the “local” experience. Eventually, after a few months we were sometimes invited to drink with new Chinese friends.\nIn short, Chinese don’t drink as often as Americans do, but when they do drink, they tend to drink more than we do. As a teetotaller, you can use this to your advantage, as those at the table may be too drunk to notice that you’re quietly spitting your alcohol into your tea glass, your coke glass or your water bottle.\nI like this “spit out” method of alcohol avoidance more then the common excuse of “I’m allergic to alcohol”. The Chinese often use this “allergy” or “liver enzyme” issue as an excuse and it’s often looked at with doubt, especially if you are a westerner.\nIn business negotiations, it’s common practice to go out for an elaborate dinner with copious amounts of drinks (beer and “baijou white liquor” are most popular). Drinking together is traditionally seen as a way to get a sense of one’s character and intentions when the guard is let down.\n-4-\nSUPERSTITIONS\nEvery culture has its superstitions, but I’ve never been to a place where superstitions are still in use as they are in China. From what I’ve been told, in the cities today these superstitions are largely just for show and fun, but in the rural areas they are taken seriously, with numbers, colors and iconography a large role in how people plan events such as a wedding or a funeral. The gifts that the Chinese give each other must adhere to rules of appropriateness based on superstitions; it’s one of China’s many interesting and unique taboos.\nForeigners are usually excused, but within Chinese society, there are many mistakes one can make!",

      "18": "I believe that many of the previous answers have given you very comprehensive and typical examples of \"the most Chinese things\" in terms of Chinese culture or lifestyle. Therefore, I'd like to introduce you to \"the most Chinese things\" from the aspects of education and campus life of Chinese students, and I will also cover some popular terms that Chinese college students like to use as well as practise recently.\n1.Evening self-study\nThough it is not only unique to Chinese high schools, but it is applied most widely in China. Chinese students, who are generally regarded as the most hard-working students in the world, commonly have evening self-study courses in high school. Besides, different from those in other countries, evening self-study is more of a compulsory part of the high school curriculum in China. After hearing this, the first thought that comes to your mind is probably: Isn't this greatly aggravating the burden of Chinese students?\nHowever, in fact, as a student who has experienced it personally, I can responsibly say that the system is actually beneficial to most students. In high school, students have a lot of courses and homework. Under this circumstance, unified evening self-study in the classroom can create a great learning atmosphere and improve students' learning efficiency to a certain extent. Back at home or in the dormitory, self-discipline might be a big challenge for the students.\n2.Eye Exercises\nNext, I would like to introduce to you a unique practice you can only see in Chinese schools, which is the Eye Exercises. This may be the first time you've heard of this, but it is completely understandable given that China is the only country in the world where students do eye exercises.\nIn fact, eye exercise is a beneficial massage based on ancient Chinese medical knowledge as well as meridian theory, combined with sports medicine. It can also be said to be a kind of gymnastics which aims at maintaining the health of eyes. Through the massage of the eye acupoints, it can improve the blood circulation of the eyes and the head, relieve eye fatigue and prevent myopia or other eye diseases.\n3. The \"100-day Oath Ceremony” which is unique to senior high schools in China.\nI believe people all over the world have heard more or less about Gaokao, the national college entrance examination system in China which is described by the majority of Chinese people as \"a war without smoke\". So, have you ever witness scenes like the following pictures?\nYou will be surprised to know the answer, but it is actually a Chinese high school students' mobilization conference 100 days before Gaokao. It is worth mentioning that whether the school is private or public, whether the school is small or big, as long as it is in China, there will certainly be such a grand ceremony before Gaokao. In Chinese students’ hearts, the “100-day oath” is not only a motivation before the exam, but also a commemoration of our youth and those great efforts we made.\nFinally, I'd like to briefly introduce to you two terms that are very popular among Chinese university students these days:\n1.“Special Forces-style Tourism”\nDuring the last three years’ outbreak of COVID-19, university students had few opportunities to travel around. Therefore, “retaliatory” tourism of \"Special Forces-style\" appeared soon after the policy was relaxed, with \"tight schedules, more scenic spots and less cost\" as the main features.\nOne specific example was that a university student only spent a 5-day vacation visiting the five Sacred Mountains of China, which are located in 5 different provinces.\n2.“Nonsense Literature”\nIt refers to a highly exaggerated, disordered, emotionally charged style of expression. \"Nonsense literature\" originated from someone’s posting some words on a social media platform saying \"What else can I say other than nonsense\", which then evolved into \"Nonsense Literature\".\nContemporary university students are facing pressure from many different sources, and such a style of expressing provides an outlet for negative emotions. It can not only form a special group identity among the majority of students, but also become the \"emotional buffer zone\", relieving students' anxiety to some extent with its humorous presentation.",

I don’t know how it works, maybe those guys watching get their turn someday, but I’m always fascinated by the amount of people just watching other people play cards. There are other tables free and they could play themselves, but it seems more enjoyment comes from watching than playing. I find this uniquely Chinese…perhaps it is the frequency with which I see it on the streets/parks and the amount of onlookers.\nI would like to relate a personal experience when I joined up to challenge one of these guys in 象棋 (chinese chess). A crowd gathered to watch the laowai play the local master, it looked similar to the picture above. I made about one or two moves before having my pieces maneuvered by the watchers. Those hanging over my shoulder would not let me, who was supposed to be playing, make a move because they didn’t want to see me lose my pieces due to my inexperience. So, after my first few moves the rest of the game was played out by the watchers.\nI puzzled over why often times multiple people participate in making a move and some strategies are even discussed openly between the two parties, but then began to think perhaps they just want to see the best possible game played no matter who wins or loses. I have never seen this to be as common an occurrence outside of China and therefore it is most certainly, to me, Chinese!",

      "24": "What are the most Chinese things ever?\nThere are many representative things in China, like Beijing opera,panda,pirate, famous scenes,serious pollution and so on. But ,if asked what is the typical one to reflect the culture and influence of China, I will choose hot pot without doubt.\nThis is a kind of traditional type of hot pot from Chong Qin,China\nFirst of all, the flavor of traditional Chinese hot pot reflex the character of ethnic culture of China-- hot,spicy which means enthusiastic and friendly to guests from the whole world. The flavor also tells us a lot of details about Chinese local conditions and customs. Chili is a good food to defense damp. So do garlic and pepper. On account of these, we can easily know that climate in the majority of eastern China is humid. At the same time, we can understand the eating habits of Chinese residents.\nAnd the next reason is the containment in the internal culture of Chinese hot pot. The food material is multifarious which means everyone can put what he likes in the hot pot. And the process of eating hot pot is also a process to share your appetites with others, and a process to make friends or find someone who has the same interests with you.\nThe hot pot itself has many different types as well. Different types come from different districts and provinces of China,which shows diverse resources and products in different areas. They also show different attitudes of the local people in cooking and living.\nFor examples:\nThis picture show us a kind of hot pot from Liaoning province(in the northeast of China). From the picture we can see that the flavor seems to be much more light compared with the Chongqing one. And it also has more meat and meat product. It is not only a hobby, but also a necessary choice. Because it is much colder in the northeast of China, and meat is a good resource to get heat to keep the local people warm in winter.\nSimilarly, hot pot with fish and sea food must come from the southeast of China. It is also a representative of the local conditions and customs there,which reflects the products, climate, character of the local residents.\nAnd this one is a type of hot pot I should focus on and tell more details. It is Moslem hot pot(清真的),which comes from the northwest of China. So from these pictures we can see , hot pot is not a food with a single cooking method and flavor. It is a carrier of Chinese food culture, and a nuclear power to unite all strength and nationalities in China.\nInfluence(foreigners like eating the Chinese hot pot, communicating effect)\nAnother reason I elect hot pot as the most Chinese thing is the influence of it among foreigners. For many foreigners, Chinese dishes are not so acceptable to them, because they may think the dishes are overcooked and have too much salt, sugar and oil. But hot pot is almost something that they cannot refuse.\nSome of them even become crazy fans of the Chinese hot pot after tasting it.\nHot pot is so popular among foreign youth\nAnd hot pot also accelerate the communication between China and the outside.\nDevelopment and innovation in hot pot\nIf you are really a big fan of the Chinese hot pot, you will find that nowadays hot pot has a little difference compared with the traditional one. It is widely used and has a new name--hot pot Yuanyang(鸳鸯火锅). It is much more comfortable and convenient, because if you are someone who cannot accept food with chili and pepper, you can also eat a meal of hot pot with your friends in a same pot.\nIt reflects the innovative spirit in Chinese culture and national tradition",

      "43": "As a local Chinese I think the most “Chinese” thing is the Chinese language. It's totally a different system of thinking and nothing like any alphabetic languanges. Maybe the only harder languange than Chinese to learn is Arabic.\nI'll try my best to explain how Chinese language works, but I know in English it sounds weird.\nThe written Chinese language has a pictographic origin, and therefore it is more like a series of drawings instead of just combination of letters. A single drawing, or a character, therefore refers to a certain image and has a lot of related meanings and probably several different pronunciations. Only the images or the characters are widely acknowledged, and that's enough. That is to say there is no grammar, no accurate meaning, and no “correct” pronunciation. In fact people in different areas all speak Chinese differently. People only read the drawings and grasp a direct information correctly and that's all.\nFor instance, study this sentence 我出去晒晒太阳。If you translate word to word it is “I go out to shine the sun.” It's a disaster for foreigners. What does he mean? How come he is able to shine on something? Or does he mean that he will light up the sun?\nNone. It means that he's going out for a sun bath.

    "answers": {
      "1": "Throwin rocks at a wild Polar Bear ?\nShort answer - No. Long answer - HELL NO.\nEven if you had a 9mm pistol (let’s say a glock)\nAnd you were facing a polar bear and you were lucky enough to let off some rounds. Guess what ? Be prepared to make peace with whatever deity you follow and learn from the lesson and do better in the next life.\nThe Bear will look at you and think……. “that looks tasty …nom nom”\nMost animals will back off at the sound of gunshot.\nNot Polar Bears\nEven if you hit them they’ll carry on charging and will get to you.\nThe only way to stop it was if you were very, very, very lucky and got the bullet through their eye into their brain, maybe.\nBut areas of instant kill with a bear charging towards you on all fours is about size of teaplate. Can you hit that repeatedly under stress ? You really do not have much time for mistakes.\nTheir skull is harder and thicker than a motorcycle helmet. They kill seals just by slapping them. Trying to alpha posture by standing tall and making yourself look bigger will accomplish nothing.\n“I’d hide behind a rock!”\nYou die behind that rock.\n“I’d jump into a river!”\nYou die wet and cold.\n“I’d stand my ground and yell at the bear to frighten it”\nYou die faster.\nThere are around three thousand polar bears on the Svalbard islands; that’s more polar bears than there are humans and they are protected by Svalbard law. So they have not built up a fear of humans.\nNot every animal wants to hug a human.\nUntil humans with BIG rifles (22 calibre ……….actually more like .444 marlin) came along, nothing hunted polar bears. Nothing. There is no scaring it off. Just look at them\nPolar bears will eat each other if they're desperate enough. So what do you think they'll do to you ?\nThey’re also dangerous because they’re skilled apex predators (meaning they have no natural predators of their own) Which means, cute as they may be, the polar bear is quite functionally the great white shark of the north.\nThey don’t hibernate.\nThey never get cold.\nFood is scarce.\nThey’re always (I repeat) ALWAYS hungry.\nThe bottom line is if you’re a human being on open ice in the Artic Tundra with no serious firearm or vehicle and you run into this pic below ?\nYou have two chances of surviving\nSlim\nNone\nAnd slim just left town\nYou know the thing about a Polar Bear when you see them in the flesh my friend ? They’ve got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll’s eyes. When they come at ya, doesn’t seem to be livin…….until they bite ya and at that point you’re not on earth anymore and the Polar bear is the last thing you'll ever see.\nAnd bears are omnivores (meat and plant eaters) which means unlike carnivores like tigers and lions who have the polite decency to kill you as quick as possible first then eat you.\nOmnivores like polar bears will just hold you down, pin you to the ground like you’re a seal or salmon and eat you while you’re alive and screaming.\nThey have a bite force of 1,000 psi (Pounds Per Square Inch) that’s a force strong enough to crack a bowling ball and they’ll use that to disable you, to rip off your arm or leg for a snack, you can’t even imagine the kinda force they can generate.\nTo a Polar Bear an average-sized human is just right for a comfortable dinner with a glass of port and a good cigar afterwards.\nYou dunno what you’re dealing with.\nAnd they’re trying to get access to your organs to chew them apart, then if there’s anything left of you, put you in stash, n come back a bit later n eat some more of you.\nJust a brutal way to go.\nThey can run at speeds of 24 miles an hour. If that doesn't impress you, the fastest man alive who was Usain Bolt his maximum top speed was 27 miles an hour and they can smell you for miles (even if your under snow) and swim for 100's of miles\nAnd they’re smart to. Polar bear on thin ice ? No problem they know they have to spread their weight around so it’s not concentrated in one spot so as to not crack the ice.\nHumans in movies : Aggressively steps on ice\nThere are only three things up in the Arctic: Ice, water, and potential calories. Guess which category people are in ?",
      "2": "If you were close enough to… you’d better hope adequate shelter is immediately nearby.\n*For fear of violating the image policy any further, I’m required to inform you that no seals were harmed in the making of this .gif*\nHere’s the thing about the arctic, food is incredibly hard to come by. Especially for a 1,000 lb bear. Polar bears are regarded has “hyper-carnivorous” meaning they’ll eat almost any animal they can catch. You are not off the menu.\nThere is no scaring it off. Making yourself look bigger will accomplish nothing. Running won’t do you any good for long. You can’t out-swim it.\nIf it catches you, it will eat you alive.\nSo let’s just assume the bear didn’t know you were there prior to you deciding today is a great day to become bear crap.\nThe average man can throw a baseball about 70–120 feet away from him (that is not far at all). So we’ll just assume the same for a rock of similar size. You now have the bear’s attention. He can clock in at a maximum of 25 miles per hour, you likely clock in at around 8. Assuming you threw the rock from 120 feet away, this thing can close the distance between you and it in about 3 seconds. So, unless you were right next to a car, you’d best start praying to whatever deities you believe in.\nEdit: Couple things. I’ve noticed a lot of folks are taking issue with the 8 mile an hour running speed for humans. This is what I found on Google:\nThat website below factored that the average speed of a human when “running for their lives” is about 12 mph. In any case, unless your average male can run 26 miles an hour, they ain’t outrunning that bear.\nAnd someone also mentioned that the bear would break the distance in 5 seconds instead of 3. I just plugged the numbers into a calculator (still probably got it wrong). I didn’t (and won’t) factor in the fact that the human would be running away, nor account for the acceleration of the bear. If any gifted math whiz’s would like to enlighten us, please feel free to do so.\nThanks again for all the love on this answer guys!",
      "3": "You get eaten.\nThat’s the default outcome between a polar bear and a human. That’s why the law in Svalbard states you have to be armed, with a proper hunting rifle, if you leave the settlement. (A handgun is every bit as efficient as giving it the finger.) You’ve still only got a fighting chance, mind you; their reaction to anything except an immediately killing shot is to charge. They simply do not feel fear; the emotion is useless to them since nothing in their natural environment can hurt them.\nIf you are unarmed, your best bet is to throw your hat and gloves to the ground and run for it. If you are extremely lucky, it just ate and is only curious about the two-legged food, so it just wants to take a good sniff.",
      "4": "I’d hate to post gory images of what would happen to you if you did that because I’d probably get banned from Quora because of showing too much gore or something like that, but here are some interesting facts to think about:\nPolar bears are the world's largest land predators and can weigh up to 1500 pounds.\nThe polar bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, means \"sea bear,\" and they are excellent swimmers, capable of swimming for long distances in open water.\nPolar bears are at the top of the food chain in the Arctic, and they have no natural predators.\nPolar bears have an incredible sense of smell and can detect prey from up to a mile away.\nPolar bears have been known to attack and kill humans who venture into their territory, making them one of the few animals known to actively hunt humans.",
      "5": "Lol I love polar bear against human questions. There's quite a few on qoura, but usually not antagonistic. If you were lucky enough to avoid a terrible gruesome death and a polar bears lunch. Your next issue would be these guys wondering why you threw a rock at an endangered species.\nThese people don't play around, especially when it comes to endangered species. They would have zero sympathy for whatever thousands of dollar fines, or jail time you'd be faced with.",
      "6": "There's a good chance the bear already sensed your presence long before you picked that rock. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating, if you can get in the range where your rock would be able to touch or at least fall near it, it has already smelled you.\nHowever, if you weren't dead before you threw that rock, it's because, for some reason, it chose to ignore you. You going a step further by throwing that rock is the textbook definition of pushing your luck.\nCongrats, you've gotten the full and undivided attention of the most powerful carnivore on land (sorry lion and tiger fan boys), and there would be no place for you to run.\nDon't believe me?\nLet's say the bear immediately starts chasing you and you take off running. Unfortunately for you, a polar bear can clock speeds of up to 40kmph, usain bolt, one of the, if not THE fastest man on the planet has a top speed of 44kmph.\nThere are automatically two odds stacked up against you: 1. You're not usain bolt, 2. Whatever your top speed might be, it'll almost be slashed in half because you'll probably be running in thick snow.\nIf by some miracle you manage to escape and hide, you'll be dealing with another problem. It's extremely strong sense of smell.\nPolar bears can smell prey over 40 miles away. The only way you can escape it is if you were to constantly keep a distance of over 40 miles away from it, which won't be very possible because it would still be on the move, constantly trying to close up the gap.\nIt's a cold wasteland out there, food is difficult to come by, that polar bear would be damned to pass up a free meal.\nWhen the polar bear eventually gets to you, it'll eat you alive, probably starting from your soft belly. It'll be a long and painful struggle until you eventually succumb to your wounds. Your remains will be unrecognizable– this statement isn't hyperbole, it's euphemism.\nTLDR: you're fucked.",
      "7": "Oh sure, go ahead and throw a rock at a wild polar bear. What could possibly go wrong? You'd be lucky if all you got was a broken arm from that encounter. Polar bears are no joke, they are one of the largest and strongest predators on the planet. If you're looking for a death wish, this might be one way to do it. But hey, it's your funeral, not mine.",
      "8": "Well, let's see... if you throw a rock at a wild polar bear, it's probably not going to be too thrilled about it. I mean, have you seen how big those things are? They're like, the size of a small car. And they have teeth. Big, sharp teeth.\nSo, chances are if you throw a rock at a polar bear, it's going to get mad. And when polar bears get mad, they don't just sit there and take it. No, they tend to do things like chase you and try to eat you. And let me tell you, being chased and eaten by a polar bear is not on my bucket list.\nBut hey, maybe you're feeling lucky. Maybe you think you can throw a rock at a polar bear and it'll just be like, \"Oh, someone threw a rock at me. How rude. I'll just go back to minding my own business now.\" In that case, go for it. I'm sure it'll be a real hoot. Just don't come crying to me when you end up as polar bear chow.",
      "9": "Well, the polar bear will have certainly noticed you now, idiot. But don’t worry, because it smelled you already for a long time, and it didn’t have to hurry anyway because you have nowhere to run.\nUnfortunately, the above image pictures your bleak future, within an hour or so.\nAnd unfortunately — again — my dear almost late friend, it will not be kind to you, because it couldn’t care less whether you suffer or not.\nYou are food, and polar bears eat food alive and kicking.\nThe kicking doesn’t last very long though.\nOn the positive side — well, never mind. There is no positive side, I’m sorry to say.\nNot for you, in any case.\nSOURCES: Google images.",
      "10": "It would eat you within seconds.\nNot only are they fast, polar bears are fearless. A chunk of rock or ice would not impress then in the slightest.\nMy BIL was doing archeological research in Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and they needed to stay in a tent. They surrounded the tent with several military tripwires. When triggered they explode and launch a flare. The bears will ignore the noise as they are used to the booming of calving glaciers. The flare? Who cares, I’m hungry. The reason for the tripwires was to warn the tent occupants so they could shoot through the tent with their .357 magnum and slug-loaded 12 gauge. They agreed that should the flare go off, shoot first and ask questions later.\nSo BIL goes outside to brush his teeth… Remember the trip wire, remember the trip wire. He steps over the wire and suddenly remembers Crap, I forgot my toothpaste! He turns around and walks through the tripwire. Bam! Flash! Chick-chink (sound of shotgun being cocked)\nDON’T SHOOT DUDE! IT’S JUST ME!\nI just need toothpaste and a clean pair of underpants.",

      "13": "Throwing a rock at a wild polar bear is highly discouraged and could be dangerous for both the thrower and the bear. Polar bears are large and powerful predators, and they can become aggressive if they feel threatened. Throwing an object at a polar bear could cause the bear to feel threatened and trigger a defensive response, potentially putting the thrower in harm's way. Additionally, harassing wildlife, including throwing objects at them, is illegal and can result in penalties. It's best to keep a safe distance from polar bears and observe them from a distance.",
      "14": "This would be you",
      "15": "Throwing a rock at a wild polar bear is not a recommended or safe action. Polar bears are apex predators and can be very dangerous to humans, especially when they feel threatened or provoked.\nIf you were to throw a rock at a polar bear, the bear may perceive it as an attack and may react aggressively towards you. The bear may charge towards you, attack you with its powerful claws and teeth, or may even kill you if it feels that its life is in danger.\nIt's important to remember that polar bears are protected by law in many areas where they live, and harming or harassing them can result in serious legal consequences. Therefore, it's best to avoid any interaction with wild polar bears and observe them from a safe distance. If you encounter a polar bear in the wild, it's recommended to stay calm, slowly back away, and make noise to alert the bear of your presence.",
      "16": "I actually watched a documentary, where a family group of Inuit were hanging out on a rocky beach, when a polar bear approached. One guy got his gun and took a shot but it misfired. While he sorted the gun out, the entire group, including an elderly granny, pelted the bear with rocks and it didn’t retreat, but it did keep its distance, and then the guy shot it. Sad for the bear.\nIf the hunter had been alone, he probably would have died.",
      "17": "NIGERRUNDAYO!!!!!!!",
      "18": "If you're lucky, the bear will throw the rock back at you (and miss!). If you're unlucky (and you ARE), the bear will eat the rock, decide that it's not tasty, but that you might be…",

      "20": "What is with all these questions about people wanting to do weird and demented shite with polar bears that live far away in the Arctic?\nIs there a Polar Bear fetish cult I don’t know about?",
      "21": "That would depend on what sort of rock you threw, it’s size and weight, how easily distracted the polar bear was, and the type of vehicle you were fleeing the polar bear in as you threw the rock.\nActually, now I think about it, the vehicle is really the only important part of that equation.",
      "22": "The polar bear would hear it as a dinner gong. Suitably alerted he'd put on his best sprint- hitting 40kph in about the same time it takes you to think : I fucked up.\nYou would then join him for dinner as the live main course. If you're very lucky he might swat your brains out first. If you're not so lucky you've got 30 agonising minutes while he's chomping on down on you before mercifully you bleed out.",
      "23": "Forget throwing a rock.\nOne of my professors, an avid and very experienced outdoorsman once told our class this when asked if he’d ever seen a polar bear in the wild:\nNo. And the way you can tell is that I’m a terrible shot, but I’m here today.\nHere’s the thing: if you see a polar bear in the wild, it already knew you were there, and it’s too late. Unless you’re a decent shot and have a high-powered rifle handy, the only thing you can do is say a prayer or write a note to your family, because you are already dead, it just hasn’t happened quite yet.\nSo, if you could somehow sneak up on one and throw a rock at it, you’d just be dooming yourself when you somehow could have run away.",
      "24": "Originally commented on Daniel Poletynski's Answer to “What would happen if I threw a rock at a wild polar bear?”\n“I haven't looked through all the comments to see if someone has worked it out yet, but…\nTL;DR: The average, healthy, human would have about 7 seconds till they're caught by a polar bear, assuming they have a 100ft head start.\nAssuming the bear is standing still, and the person begins sprinting as soon as the rock hits the bear, and the bear doesn't take a second to figure out what's going on, and the bear is already facing the direction of the person and sees them as soon as the rock hits them… and based on a few, rather graphic, videos I watched of polar bears chasing prey.\nThe average person can fast jog or “run\" about 8mph. When sprinting, most (relatively healthy) people can reach about 12mph, for at least 150m, especially if they're running for their life.\nBecause the human is prepared to run, and our acceleration time is negligible, and I'm already giving the bear some advantages in this assessment, I will negate the human's acceleration in my calculations. I'm also assuming this isn't taking place in snow, where a human would not be able to reach 12mph.\nBear's Run: takes ~2 seconds to reach top speed\n25mph × 5280ft/m ÷ 60min/h ÷ 60s/m\n= 36⅔ft/s (top speed)\n÷ 2s = 18⅓ft/s² (acceleration for the first 2 seconds)\nD = V×T + ½A×T² = 0ft/s²×2s + ½(18⅓ft/s²)×2s²\n= 36⅔ft (Distance traveled during acceleration)\nSo we find that the bear travels…\nD = 36⅔X - (36⅔(2) - 36⅔)\n= 36⅔X - 36⅔\nHuman's R...",

      "28": "Throwing a rock at a wild polar bear is not only illegal, but it is also extremely dangerous and could result in serious injury or death for both you and the bear. Polar bears are powerful predators and can easily harm humans with their sharp claws and teeth. If you were to throw a rock at a polar bear, it is likely that the bear would feel threatened and could respond aggressively to defend itself. This could result in a violent attack, causing serious harm or death to you or others nearby. It's important to always respect wildlife and keep a safe distance to avoid any dangerous situations. If you encounter a wild polar bear, it's best to slowly and calmly back away without making any sudden movements or loud noises.",
      "29": "If you're physically fit, it's best to get out as quickly as possible, as big male polar bears are bad runners. While they have good short bursts, they don't have much stamina.

      "43": "You'll emerge victorious.\nHumans Defeat Polar Bear\nOnce upon a time, in a world much like our own, humans and polar bears coexisted in a delicate balance. For years, the polar bears had been considered the undisputed rulers of the frozen north, with their immense strength, razor-sharp claws, and thick fur coats that protected them from the harshest of blizzards.\nBut as the years went on, the humans began to grow restless. They were tired of being constantly overshadowed by the majestic beasts that roamed their land, and they longed for a chance to prove themselves against the polar bears.\nOne day, a group of human adventurers set out on a daring expedition to hunt down the most ferocious polar bear in the region. Armed with nothing more than their wits and a few crude weapons, they braved the icy winds and snowstorms, determined to come out victorious.\nAfter several days of tracking their prey through the frozen wilderness, the humans finally caught sight of the polar bear they had been seeking. It was a massive beast, easily twice their size, with gleaming white fur and a fearsome snarl that made even the bravest among them quiver with fear.\nBut instead of running away or cowering in terror, the humans stood their ground. They knew that this was their chance to prove themselves, and they weren't going to let it slip away.\nWith a fierce battle cry, the humans charged forward, their weapons raised high. The polar bear roared in anger, lashing out with its massive claws, but the humans were too quick for it. They dodged and weaved, striking at the bear's vulnerable spots with expert precision.\nFor hours, the battle raged on, with both sides refusing to give an inch. But in the end, it was the humans who emerged victorious. They had managed to outsmart and outmaneuver the mighty polar bear, proving once and for all that they were just as capable and powerful as any creature in the frozen north.\nFrom that day forward, the humans and polar bears lived in a newfound respect for one another. The humans had earned the bears' admiration and respect, and the bears had learned to appreciate the strength and bravery of their human counterparts. And although there were still challenges and obstacles to overcome, they faced them together, as equals..\n🗿Hence Proved",

Actually, I knew nothing about China until I was 25 years old.\nMy knowledge of China comes from Hollywood movies, BBC news, Mediacorp, and BBS.\nIt was a place ruled by an evil regime, and people wore gray and blue clothes, rode bicycles, and wore the same hats .\nThey ate dog meat every day, and baby girls were killed. Anyone who says a bad word about the leader is gone the next day.The air is full of smog, food and powdered milk are poisonous.\nAll in all, a horrible place.\nUntil ten years ago, when social media became popular, I saw many real pictures and videos of China. While there is still a lot of bad content, there is a lot of good content coming out. However, I still think it's a terrible place.\n5 years ago, I went to China for the first time because of my work. I went to Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and even a village in Guizhou Province.\nWithin an hour of leaving the plane, I was shocked by this country, and for the next hundred hours, I was shocked by this country every hour.\nI found that all my images of China in the past were wrong. This is a super-modern country, people are very orderly, and the degree of modernization of buildings, roads, and cities surpasses all countries I have been to, including European and American countries.\nThere are no gray-blue clothes, and no one eats dog meat.\nThe girls are very fashionable and beautiful. Their cops don't even have guns and batons, and they rarely show up.\nWe can drink in the street and take a walk late at night. In the pub people talk about elections in America, stocks in London. The milk tea is very delicious, and all kinds of food are very delicious.\nChinese people don't use cash or credit cards, they use QR codes for all payments. Made me look like a redneck on my first shopping trip.\nIn the following years, I traveled to China twice. 2020 break. I went there again this year, and China has undergone tremendous changes again.\nOn the streets of Shenzhen, at least half of the cars have been replaced with green license plates. That's the massive EV revolution.\nI don't know how many words to describe the change in my view of China. Perhaps, only when people go to China can they experience all this.",

It was nauseating and despicable to see thousands of “Communist cadres” mouthing and shouting mindless slogans, all dressed alike, that you can barely differentiate between the sexes, beating and parading people on the streets in dunce caps, tied and humiliated. This went on for months, and it appeared that Mao and his supporters encouraged it. A whole generation in China had their lives, families, and education aspirations torn upside down, over a10 years period.\nI thought to myself, who would want to live in that place, let alone visit !!!\nFast forward to 1980s and 1990s, after Deng XiaoPing brought order out of the chaos, opened China's doors to the world and started embarking on the path to modernization and progress. China then, severely poverty stricken, started from ground zero, no way to go but up.\nIn 1996 or so, I made my first trip to China for business. I was reluctant to go, but had no choice. I went, I hear A, but saw B. Each visit to China, opened my eyes to the reality and the opposite of what have been negatively said about China, it's society, it's government and it's people's living conditions, compared to what reality and the truth is, that I saw with my own eyes, and analysed with my own mind.\nChina progressed. I was pleasantly surprised at local Chinese citizens approach to foreigners, even to overseas Chinese. Welcoming, friendly, open minded and warm. Each trip since, I saw the continued progress and modernization of the Chinese cities and communities. Each Chinese person I met was open, friendly and glad to connect and “learn” from me.\nThe China today is not the China of the hardcore Maoist era !! China today is a very modernized society in terms of their infrastructures, housing estates, public transportation, and they are free to have the education they want, the career and business they wish for, bring their families up in a very safe and comfortable social environment.

      "2": "Culture plays a significant role in shaping human behavior. It encompasses the shared beliefs, values, customs, traditions, language, and social norms that are transmitted across generations within a particular group or society. Here are several ways in which culture influences human behavior:\nSocialization: Culture provides the framework for socialization, the process through which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to function as members of a particular society. From a young age, individuals learn cultural norms, values, and expected behaviors through interactions with family, peers, and other social institutions.\nNorms and Values: Culture establishes the norms and values that guide behavior. Norms are the explicit or implicit rules that dictate what is considered appropriate or inappropriate in a given social context. Values are the fundamental beliefs and ideals that shape people's attitudes and judgments. These norms and values influence individuals' actions, decisions, and interactions with others.\nPerception and Worldview: Culture shapes how individuals perceive and interpret the world around them. It influences the way people make sense of their experiences, assign meanings to events, and develop their worldview. Cultural factors such as language, religious beliefs, and historical experiences can significantly impact how individuals perceive reality and form their understanding of the world.\nCommunication Styles: Culture influences communication patterns and styles. It determines the preferred modes of communication, nonverbal cues, and appropriate conversational norms within a particular society. Different cultures may have distinct communication styles, such as direct or indirect communication, high or low context communication, and varying levels of assertiveness or politeness.\nSocial Roles and Hierarchies: Culture assigns roles and positions within a society, establishing social hierarchies and expectations for behavior. These roles and hierarchies influence individuals' behavior and interactions within their communities. Cultural expectations regarding gender, age, social class, and other identities can significantly shape individuals' roles, responsibilities, and opportunities.\nCultural Norms and Laws: Culture influences the development of legal systems and societal norms. Laws and regulations reflect the values, priorities, and social consensus within a particular culture. These legal frameworks and social norms provide guidelines and consequences that influence individual behavior, helping to maintain social order and cohesion.\nAttitudes and Beliefs: Culture shapes attitudes and beliefs about various aspects of life, including family, education, work, religion, gender roles, and morality. These attitudes and beliefs influence individuals' choices, aspirations, and behavior patterns. They can impact decisions related to career paths, relationships, and adherence to social or religious practices.\nIt's important to note that culture is not static and varies across different regions, communities, and even subcultures within a society. Additionally, individuals may internalize multiple cultures due to factors like multicultural environments, globalization, and personal experiences, leading to complex and diverse influences on human behavior.",

      "6": "Culture significantly influences human behavior by shaping the beliefs, values, norms, customs, and practices that individuals in a particular society adopt. Here are some ways in which culture impacts behavior:\nSocial Norms and Expectations: Culture sets the standard for acceptable behavior within a society. It defines what is considered appropriate, rude, taboo, or polite. People tend to conform to these norms to be accepted within their cultural group.\nCommunication and Language: Language is a fundamental aspect of culture. Different cultures have unique languages with distinct nuances and ways of expressing ideas. The language people speak can influence their thought processes, perceptions, and interactions.\nValues and Beliefs: Culture shapes individuals' values and beliefs, which influence their decision-making and behavior. These values could include beliefs about family, spirituality, work ethic, or societal roles. Cultural values often guide how people prioritize goals and make moral judgments.\nSocial Structures and Roles: Cultural norms dictate the roles and responsibilities of individuals within a society. These roles can influence behavior in terms of expectations regarding family dynamics, gender roles, and community participation.\nLearning and Education: Educational systems and practices are deeply influenced by culture. What is taught, how it's taught, and the importance placed on education can vary based on cultural values and priorities.\nCultural Symbols and Artifacts: Symbols, art, and artifacts are expressions of culture. They can influence behavior by evoking emotions, shaping identities, and conveying messages about values and beliefs.\nCultural Traditions and Rituals: Rituals, ceremonies, and traditions are important aspects of culture that guide behavior and create a sense of belonging and continuity. They often provide a framework for how events and transitions are approached.\nPerceptions of Time and Punctuality: Cultural attitudes towards time can differ significantly.

This can influence behaviors related to timeliness and deadlines.\nResponse to Authority and Hierarchies: Cultures can vary in how they view and respond to authority and hierarchies. Some cultures emphasize respect for authority figures and adhere to strict hierarchies, while others may encourage more egalitarian approaches.\nCultural Attitudes Towards Change: The willingness to embrace change and innovation can be influenced by cultural beliefs and traditions. Some cultures may embrace change readily, while others may be more conservative and resistant to change.\nUnderstanding these cultural influences on behavior is crucial for effective communication, collaboration, and building relationships across diverse cultures.",
      "7": "As a historian and a culture professor, I can tell you that culture has a profound influence on human behavior. It shapes our values, beliefs, and norms, which in turn guide our thoughts, feelings, and actions.\nHere are some specific ways in which culture influences human behavior:\nCulture shapes our values. Our values are the things that we believe are important in life. They guide our decisions and our actions. For example, in some cultures, the value of family is very strong. This means that people in these cultures are likely to put a lot of emphasis on their relationships with their family members. In other cultures, the value of independence is more important. This means that people in these cultures are more likely to value their own personal freedom and autonomy.\nCulture shapes our beliefs. Our beliefs are our understandings of the world around us. They influence how we interpret events and how we make decisions. For example, in some cultures, people believe that the supernatural is a powerful force that can influence events in the world. This belief may lead people to engage in rituals or practices that they believe will protect them from harm or bring them good fortune. In other cultures, people may not believe in the supernatural at all. This belief may lead them to take a more scientific or rational approach to understanding the world.\nCulture shapes our norms. Our norms are the rules that govern our behavior in society. They tell us what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behavior. For example, in some cultures, it is considered rude to make eye contact with someone you don't know. In other cultures, eye contact is seen as a sign of respect. Our norms also tell us how we should interact with each other in different social settings. For example, in some cultures, it is considered polite to shake hands when you meet someone new. In other cultures, it is considered more polite to bow or kiss the other person's cheek.\nThese are just a few of the ways in which culture influences human behavior. Culture is a complex and dynamic force that shapes our lives in many ways. By understanding the role of culture, we can better understand ourselves and the world around us.\nIn addition to the points I have already made, I would like to add that culture can also influence human behavior through the following mechanisms:\nSymbols. Symbols are objects, words, or actions that have a special meaning within a culture. For example, the American flag is a symbol of patriotism and national pride. In some cultures, the color red is a symbol of danger or anger. Symbols can influence our behavior by shaping our emotions and our perceptions of the world around us.\nRituals. Rituals are repeated behaviors that have a special meaning within a culture. They can be religious, social, or political in nature. For example, many cultures have rituals associated with birth, death, and marriage. Rituals can influence our behavior by providing us with a sense of order and predictability in our lives. They can also help us to connect with our culture and to feel a sense of belonging.\nLanguage. Language is a powerful tool that can influence our behavior in many ways. It can shape our thoughts, our emotions, and our actions. For example, the way we talk about ourselves and others can affect our self-esteem and our relationships with others. The way we talk about the world around us can influence our perceptions of reality.\nI hope this helps to answer your question. Please Upvote my answer if you like it and comment your thoughts.",
      "8": "Culture influences our behavior all through our lives. It creates a framework from where we draw our beliefs, values and general perception of the world. It can be both positive and negative. Often culture tried to impress values that create a productive and cooperative society. However it often punishes those who are different for one reason or another. Oftentimes culture will breed disparities between different groups in society whether it be by gender, role, religion, sexual preferences or ethnicity.\nCulture is also a driving force in the creative expression of people. It is reflected in music, fashion and artwork; even literature.\nThe larger a society, the slower culture is to change I think. This would be because it takes more effort to change the overall view. Some technologies made this easier like the internet and other wide spread media. Media campaigns have actually created intense changes in societies over short periods and I think America is a good example of this. America is a younger country than many others and widespread media has essentially forced migration from some values to others within the span of a decade. You can see this by looking at marketing campaigns over the past hundred years.\nThrough media, we were trained to uphold breakfast in the highest regard. We were convienced that plastic should be thrown away instead of reused, then can recycling. We were taught diamonds are forevor but love isn’t.\nWhat many don’t think about is that we’ve been taught that people should pay and suffer for actions taken generations before. It’s not just the sins of our fathers. It’s the sins of our forefathers and their forefathers. I wish our culture would emphasize the importance of forgiveness and the importance of embracing the future together.",

      "18": "Culture is a set of values, beliefs, norms, and customs that are shared by a group of people. Culture can be influential in shaping human behavior because it provides a framework for how people think about and interact with the world.\nCulture is a huge part of human behavior. It influences the way we think, feel, and act. Culture is passed down from generation to generation and helps to mold us into the people we are today.\nEvery culture is different and has its own unique way of looking at the world. This can lead to different types of behaviors that may be considered normal in one culture but strange or even wrong in another. For example, hugging and kissing in public might be perfectly acceptable in some cultures but considered quite taboo in others.\nIn other words, our culture dictates what we consider acceptable or taboo behavior, which can influence our choices and actions. For example, in some cultures, it is acceptable to eat dog meat, while in others, it is considered repulsive.\nIn addition, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. For instance, when two people from different cultures interact, they may have different ideas about what is considered polite behavior. This can lead to misunderstanding and conflict if they cannot effectively communicate with each other.\nCulture is influential because it helps to shape our identities. It allows us to belong to a group and feel like we have a shared purpose or mission. Culture can also provide us with a sense of stability and community in an ever-changing world.\nAdditionally, culture can be a source of creativity and inspiration. When we are exposed to new ideas and perspectives, we can learn new ways of thinking and problem-solving.\nFinally, culture can be a source of strength during difficult times. When we feel disconnected from our culture, we may feel lost and alone. However, by reconnecting with our culture, we can find comfort and support.",
      "19": "Culture is a multifaceted phenomenon that affects nearly every aspect of human life, from our attitudes and beliefs to our behaviors and values. One way in which culture influences human behavior is through the socialization process. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture and society.\nTo illustrate the impact of culture on human behavior through socialization, let's consider the story of two brothers, Raj and Samir, who grew up in two different cultures. Raj grew up in a collectivist culture, where the needs of the group were emphasized over individual needs and conformity and obedience were highly valued. Samir, on the other hand, grew up in an individualistic culture, where personal achievement and autonomy were prioritized.\nAs children, Raj and Samir were socialized differently. Raj was taught to be cooperative and deferential to authority figures, while Samir was encouraged to be independent and assertive. These cultural values and beliefs influenced the way Raj and Samir thought and behaved in different situations.\nFor example, when faced with a group decision, Raj was more likely to prioritize the needs and opinions of the group over his own desires. In contrast, Samir was more likely to assert his own opinions and advocate for his own interests, even if it meant going against the wishes of the group.\nAs adults, Raj and Samir continue to be influenced by the cultural values and norms they learned in childhood. Raj's collectivist values shape the way he interacts with others, prioritizing group harmony and cooperation. Samir's individualistic values drive him to be more self-reliant and independent, valuing personal achievement and success.\nThis story highlights how culture influences human behavior through the socialization process. The values and beliefs we learn from our culture and society shape the way we think and behave in different situations. By understanding how culture influences behavior, we can appreciate the diversity of human experience and learn to navigate cultural differences with empathy and respect.",

If you look at people from different places across the globe, you will find that they behave in a certain way that can be understood as their native characteristics. Humans form a culture, and the culture influences their life. Thus, we can say that both are interlinked.\nIf you decode the term ‘culture’, it consists of geographical characteristics, social customs, food habits, religious and spiritual practices, and history. All these traits make an individual act or react in a way that shows his identity. For example, accepting death as a part of life and offering a grateful departure is a part of Indian culture. It has come out of the highest philosophy of Indian tradition. On the other hand, the traditions are completely different in western countries or gulf countries.\nThe same factor dictates our responses to several events or emotions. Different groups of people behave in their own distinctive manner towards changing weather, happy or sad moments, marriages, music, festivals, and so on. It is the culture only that makes us accept or reject something. Since India experiences various weathers in a year therefore the country has a higher number of festivals than European places.\nAlso, culture inspires art and creativity too. Stories, films, music, poems, and paintings, all carry their cultural identity. By merely looking at them, you could identify their origin. It also gives a sense of stability, comfort, and strength when you are among your kind of people. It helps you give shape to your life. This is the reason why people love being in their community.

Culture shapes the way individuals think, communicate and interact with one another. It also influences the values and beliefs a person has, as well as their sense of identity, social and economic roles, personal preferences, customs, and behaviors.\nFor example, in the US, individualism is a highly valued trait, which leads to a focus on the needs of the individual over those of the community. This results in people considering their individual success and interests above that of the collective. Meanwhile, in some Asian cultures, such as Japan, India, collective values are emphasized, resulting in people being more mindful of the needs of their family, friends and community as a whole.\nAnother example is how culture influences communication styles. In some cultures, direct confrontation and open disagreement are discouraged, so communication is indirect, relying on hints and subtle nuances. In more direct cultures like Germany, communication is more straightforward and open disagreement is accepted.\nUltimately, culture has a huge influence on human behavior and is an important part of our identity.

Here are some ways in which culture influences human behavior:\nSocialization: Culture begins to influence behavior from an early age through the process of socialization. Children learn cultural norms, values, and behaviors by observing and imitating the actions of others in their cultural environment. They are taught what is considered appropriate or inappropriate in their culture, shaping their behavior accordingly.\nNorms and Values: Every culture has its own set of norms and values that guide behavior. Norms are the accepted patterns of behavior within a society, while values represent the beliefs and ideals that a culture considers important. These norms and values dictate how individuals interact with others, make decisions, and behave in various social situations.\nCommunication and Language: Language is a fundamental aspect of culture, and it greatly influences human behavior. The language a person speaks shapes their worldview, thoughts, and the way they express themselves. Different languages may have different structures and vocabulary, leading to variations in communication styles and behaviors across cultures.\nGender Roles: Culture plays a crucial role in defining gender roles and expectations. It determines the division of labor, responsibilities, and behaviors deemed appropriate for males and females. These cultural expectations influence the behavior of individuals, impacting their career choices, family roles, and social interactions.\nSocial Hierarchy: Culture often establishes social hierarchies and power structures, which influence behavior within a society. The attitudes and behaviors towards authority, respect, and obedience are shaped by cultural norms. Individuals may conform to social expectations based on their position within the hierarchy, affecting their behavior in different social contexts.",

      "34": "Culture is a belief about ethics, behaviors and values that are held by a majority of people within a society. The culture of which we are a part impacts our identity and even our beliefs about the nature of life. The type of culture either Individualistic or Collective into which a person is born affects and influences what that person believes and how that person behaves. For example, someone growing up in a “tight” (Collective) culture, where rules are strongly enforced, does not support individualistic thought or behavior.\nHowever, persons who are raised in a “loose” (Individualistic) culture have more latitude in how they behave and what they believe. Loose cultures are more prominent in western societies like America. These cultures are based on the belief that a person’s life belongs to that person, which is in alignment with the founding fathers’ Bill of Rights.\nOn the other hand, Collective cultures believe a person’s first obligation is to society. And, they must sacrifice their needs to benefit the greater good. When rules of thought and behavior are more rigid, it is a Collective society.\nEvery culture has aspects of Individualistic and Collectivistic beliefs, but in Individualistic cultures more value is placed on being extroverted. Individualistic cultures find people to be more open than Collectivistic cultures. And, Collectivistic cultures support a more introverted personality style and encourage behaviors that are representative of the majority of people. Collectivistic cultures are good at seeing other people’s perspective to foster group harmony, whereas there is not as much in Individualistic cultures.\nThe personality trait of extroversion motivates people’s individualistic thought and behavior so there are more differences in the population. If culture fosters a more extroverted personality style, we can expect more need for social interaction. Additionally, Individualistic cultures foster more assertive and outspoken behavior. When the general population encourages these gregarious behaviors, more ideas are exchanged and self-esteem increases.\nThe opposite of extroversion is not introversion. More correctly, people who are low in extroversion are more likely to be less socially inclined, but that doesn’t mean that they do not enjoy socializing. They may like to socialize in smaller groups or one on one. They can be less assertive. Additionally, a person who is low in extroversion tends to be less energetic and less active.\nAnother difference can be noted by comparing the moods of extroverts with those who have less extroversion. People who come from loose cultures seem to be happier. This may be because they get more attention. Being noticed is a psychological reward.\nCulture also reinforces certain religious beliefs. Some countries are predominantly Catholic while others may be Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu or Buddhist. Each religion carries its own set of standards for personal conduct. For example, consider how these cultures limit the choices people have in choosing a profession, a spouse, women’s roles and the garments they wear and behave.\nSome cultures encourage close physical proximity when in conversation, while others foster loud, even argumentative verbal exchanges, and some may prize soft-spoken, polite conversation.\nEmotional well-being is generally more evidenced in cultures that promote belief in facts and not theories because there is more emotional security in reality. Greater emotional well-being was noted in immigrants whose personality characteristics were more congruent with the cultural norms of the new country to which they migrated.

      "1": "An alternative test to confirm that the color in a substance is due to metal ions without using a flame test is the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy. UV-Vis spectroscopy is a technique that measures the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by molecules or ions in a sample. It can provide valuable information about the presence of metal ions based on their characteristic absorption spectra.\nHere's how UV-Vis spectroscopy can be used:\nSample Preparation: Dissolve the substance or compound of interest in a suitable solvent to create a clear solution. Ensure that the concentration of metal ions is within the detectable range.\nInstrument Setup: Use a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, which is a specialized laboratory instrument for this purpose. Set up the instrument with the appropriate wavelength range (typically in the UV and visible light spectrum).\nBaseline Measurement: Measure the baseline absorbance of the solvent alone, which serves as a reference.\nSample Measurement: Measure the absorbance of the sample solution. The presence of metal ions can result in characteristic peaks or absorption bands in the UV-Vis spectrum.\nAnalysis: Compare the absorption spectrum of the sample to known spectra of metal ions to identify the presence of specific metal ions. Each metal ion has a unique absorption spectrum due to its electronic transitions.\nThis method is more quantitative and precise than a flame test and can provide information about the concentration of metal ions in the sample. It's widely used in analytical chemistry and is particularly useful when the metal ions are present in low concentrations or when you need to distinguish between different metal ions with similar flame test colors.",

      "3": "without knowing what sort of material or sample you’re trying to test for metals, I’m not exactly sure what sort of chemical tests would be most appropriate. but in general, if you’re dealing with metals in a solution, the easiest sort of confirmatory test that you can carry out for certain metals is to treat the sample with a special reagent, a chemical mixture, that produces a specific and striking color reaction for the metal in question. let’s say for example that you had a pale green solution of something that you might suspect of having nickel, as Ni⁺² ions, dissolved in it. adding a drop of the solution to a special test paper or indicator containing a compound like dimethylglyoxime (also called “diacetyldioxime”) precipitates the bright red coördination compound of nickel(2) with dimethylglyoxime. no other common metals react in the same way with the dimethylglyoxime reagent, so this formation of a bright red compound is a color reaction that can be used as a quick test for the presence of nickel.\nmany such specific chemical reagents that produce bright colors or changes in color with a particular metal exist, although not all of them are as specific and sensitive as the dimethylglyoxime test for nickel. all the same, color tests or “spot tests” like these are an important method of confirming the presence of metals or other particular substances. ~Alyx"

To you, it's some poor defenseless bird some stranger cat just murdered and deposited on your doorstep, but to the cat, he has just brought you the most sacred of gifts…food! And he's not even making you share it with him. You should praise him for all his hard work. And then you should name him, maybe let him come inside. But whatever you do, don't tell people you don't have a cat around him…you'll hurt his feelings",

You must have a special place in her world !\nMy cat is strictly indoors where there are no birds or mice for her to gift to me - so, at night she will sometimes ‘hunt’ for a stray sock or pot holder on a counter top. She’ll then drop it by my bedside and do her special and distinct meow for such events. I will pick it up and pretend to eat it. Then I praise her lavishly while she rubs against my legs with affection.",

      "7": "The cat is attempting to rehome itself. This is classic cat behaviour. There was a cat in our neighbourhood many years ago who did the same to us: birds, mice, you name it. She wasn’t hungry, other she would have eaten the creatures, she just wanted a change of scenery. Then one day, when I was making a pot of chicken stock, she walked into the kitchen (the door was open) and meeowed by the cooker until the stock was made and I took out the chicken giblets and fed to her on a saucer.\nFrom that moment on, she lived with us and she lived until the age of nineteen/",

He sounds like a smart cat who is quite capable of complex communication with his favourite person.\nPics?",
      "9": "Guess what? It is now! You should name your kitty, and thank kitty for trying to make you happy with all these presents they keep bringing you! Cats often bring their kills to their favorite people. Once, my cat Cooper had caught a mouse and I didn't notice until I saw him snuffle the stiff, then look at me and meow (expecting praise), so I called my husband who was in the other room and asked him “Did you know your son got a mouse?” And my husband Joe goes, “No, where?” And I tell him the living room, and he comes in and sees, then starts praising our quite miffed kitty. Cooper got a few extra kitty treats for his trouble…\nPic of our handsome tabby with his bestie, Rocko.",
      "10": "I had a cat do this for me. I explained to her that baby birds were not ok but dead mice were ok. She was very smart. She never brought me another baby bird. But she did kill any mouse she found outside my apartment. I praised her every time she brought a mouse. I also made a bed for her using a box lid and a hand towel on my porch since I couldn’t afford the pet deposit. When I move I took her with me. We had 12 wonderful years together.",

I’m sure a nice bowl of cat food and some water would be greatly appreciated, too.\nWhen you’ve gained a little more trust, please take him to the vet. Maybe in the winter the little guy will come inside and get out of the cold.",
      "12": "Do your neighborhood birds a huge favor and bring the cat inside. Take the cat to the vet for spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and whatever else is needed. Then make the cat an indoor cat, your indoor cat. You’re being courted. The cat wants to be your cat. Please accept this gift.",
      "13": "The cat seems to have adopted you. I suspect that this cat have no regular human in their life as if they did, that human would recieve the ‘presents’. Check for a collar with a phone number on it or check Facebook cat groups for someone locally who has a scanner that can check for a chip implanted in the cat. Put a paper collar round their neck with your details on it. If no owner is apparent after that then you can consider yourself to now have an animal companion.\nMake sure that you don't freak out when they bring you presents..in the cats mind they are doing something incredibly generous and natural. Just thank them and dispose of the bird out of site of the cat.",

      "15": "I think that cat has chosen you and your home as his next home. He probably had a home once and maybe was left behind when his owners moved away (heartbreaking, I know, but I keep reading about people doing this)\nAnd so he knows what a home is, and has chosen yours. What an honor! I don’t know when you posted this, but I hope you took him in. And have him bean indoors only cat. That is important!",

      "22": "The cat is auditioning to be your cat. He's trying to impress you with his birdicidal skills. Once you give him the job, he will probably go back to his usual cat attitude. The attitude of you owe me food, shelter and cleaning up my mess and I owe you nothing. “Hey human, give me some food and then get lost!” LOL",
      "23": "Awwwwe, the kitty loves you and is trying to impress you! It is difficult to know why cats pick the people they do but it happens all the time. My family had a cat already and suddenly this other cat started coming in the backyard. I caught him stealing one of my husband’s smelly socks from shoes left on the patio. That explained why my husband kept losing one sock all the time. It took me awhile to figure out where the cat lived but it turned out he had a home two doors down. Every day the cat would jump over several 8 foot tall cinder block walls, come on the patio, grab a sock and run back. I asked my vet about this and she said he is trying to tell you he likes you and wants your “scent” close by. Socks give off the most odor usually so they tend to like them the most. LOL!! One day I came home and this cat was sleeping under my dining room table. My other cat was perfectly fine with it. My son was very amused by this and now the cat is bringing us little wild bunnies it has caught. Yes, they were deceased and it was disturbing but I knew what was going on. I walked down to the neighbor’s house and asked them about this cat. They said they were moving and we could keep him if we wanted. I was surprised but it turned out they had a dog that had killed another cat in their backyard a month before and they had been feeding this one on the wall for his safety. So, basically, he was in danger and his life depended on him finding another home. Of course, we took him in and he became Daryl the cat. Daryl was the sweetest, most loving cat I’ve ever had. Years later, he would still bring us a gift occasionally. I walked into the dining room to find him with a giant seagull flapping in his jaws. He dropped it to show me his capture and it tried to fly around in the small space between the table and buffet squawking loudly. He seemed so proud of himself for this lovely gift — I just managed to get the bird out on the patio so it could leave and gave Daryl a treat.",
      "24": "What you have, good sir, is a feline admirer. The dead birds are a gift. Yeah, it’s gross, but in the cat world a dead bird is an item of great value. It’s basically the equivalent of a human leaving an Academy Awards gift basket on your doorstep every morning. May we all find someone who loves us as much as that cat loves you.",
      "25": "This cat seems to have adopted you. You are the “chosen one”. That is the reason for the “presents” you have been receiving. Please reciprocate: choose this cat and offer it a good home. You can live happily ever after together. Something about you is very special and the cat recognizes it. Please respond with love and compassion. Something about you resonates with this cat. You are so lucky!!",
      "26": "Yes, like everyone else has said here - this kitty LIKES you & is hoping to maybe move in with you. The dead birds are presents. The cat may have been abandoned nearby and is looking for a new home. Or, depending on how long you have lived there, maybe the previous resident moved out of the house you are in and left the cat behind. I adopted a cat that had been abandoned like that.\nMy sister & her family lived out in a fairly remote wooded area with no neighbors nearby. A little female kitty that had been abandoned started hanging around. She also brought them dead “gifts”. Eventually when the family started packing up to move away, the rate of the dead “presents” really increased; the cat was trying to show them what a good provider she was, and was lobbying for them to please, PLEASE take her with them!\nThey did, and she was a wonderful pet for many years. Cats that have been feral and on their own for some time totally appreciate the Good Life when they get adopted!",
      "27": "I have to correct you. This is your cat, you've been chosen. The sooner you accept this and bring in athe cat the sooner you will both be happy as will the local wildlife.\nSo cat food bowl,, water bowl, litter box, litter, a variety of cat toys, and cat kibble.\nAlso please share a photo of your brand new housemate. Please?",
      "28": "I posted the following, without the photo, as a comment on another person’s answer to this question, and was asked to make it an answer.\nIn addition to prey being offered as a gift or as an attempt to feed others, cats may also catch live prey as a precursor to teaching hunting skills. We had one cat who would bring live mice home to our pre-teen children, perhaps thinking she’d teach them to hunt. (They were not thrilled with the idea.)\nCurrently, we have three indoor cats, and the oldest, Boston, raised our two younger cats, whom we adopted at 5 months and 4 months of age, respectively. They're all rescues, and not related to each other.\nWhen he was an only cat, Boston would go downstairs to the basement every evening to patrol for mice. We live in the country, so his work was often successful. He would kill them efficiently and leave them at the back door for me to dispose of. He would then come upstairs and bang on the door with his paw to indicate he was going off shift for the night.\nUnfortunately, once we added the younger cats, William and Brynn, whom we did not allow in the basement (if you knew William aka Wildman, you'd understand), Boston started to live-catch the mice and bring them upstairs, clearly intending to teach the youngsters how to hunt. Having a mouse tearing around our main floor with three cats and an excited dog in pursuit was…stressful. I had to stop letting Boston go down to the basement.\nThat was nearly 3 years ago, and Boston still occasionally asks to go down to the basement in the evening, and we still regretfully remind him he lost that job.\nBut he is raising Howie, our young half-Husky rescue dog (shown with Boston in photo), who was part of an unowned dog pack, and he still has to wrangle the two younger cats, so he's not unemployed!\nReply",
      "29": "The cat likes you and wishes to keep you around. :-D Seriously, sometimes cats will do this sort of thing. More often instead of luring you out to dinner, the cat will carry prey into the house and present it to you.\nMy theory is that cats regard humans as large, misshapen, and not quite bright kittens. Thus they feel that you need some help to stay alive in this cruel world, and so they bring you food.\nMakes sense, right? ;-)",
      "30": "Congratulations! The cat has adopted you and is trying to feed you because it thinks you’re helpless. 😂 My advice is to praise and pet the cat (make it seem like you love the present) and dispose of the bird after it leaves.",
      "31": "This cat is bringing you presents. You typically see this if you have a female cat of your own, who he is courting and bringing gifts to. If you don't have a female cat, then he is bringing these gifts to you.\nThese cats are not much different than a man in one regard. A man does the same thing when he is trying to court a woman. He brings her gifts to please her.\nPeople usually give to others, what they would like themselves, so this cat thinks, of course, that you would like these birds too!\nI came out of my bedroom one morning, and almost stepped on a mouse that had been placed on the floor, in front of my bedroom door! One of my cats wanted to make me happy and left this gift for me.\nThen, my sister-in-law had a cat that once carefully placed a mouse right across her throat while she slept. Now you can’t get more deliberate than that! Can you imagine that? Haha!\nAfter I got over my surprise, over my unexpected gift, I thought to myself, “how sweet!” Afterall, it is the thought that counts! Then I quickly disposed of it after I showed the mouse to my cat and gave him massive praise, to let him know I appreciated his affection for me.\nPerhaps you petted this cat a few times and showed him affection. Maybe you fed him once or twice and he is saying thank you.\nYou did something to make him like you and he wants to be your friend. Thank you for being kind to him. Perhaps he can become your cat too!",
      "32": "Awww… how sweet! Kitty is taking care of you by making sure you have something to eat! Kitty could be eating the prize of her work, but instead gave it to you! You are loved. Thank kitty profusely, carry on over the bird for a minute or two, then discreetly get rid of it. She will be thrilled that you appreciate the gift given. If I were you, I’d welcome kitty as part of my family. A bowl of kitty kibble will be appreciated on days when hunting did not work out.",
      "33": "Somebody's trying SO HARD to be your friend! Offer that darling a bowl of food, one of water & an open door into your home. Please don't hurt their feelings by turning down that wonderful gift you've been offered! He/she is trying to tell you this feels like home to them. What a blessing & compliment to you. This baby needs you! Accept this offer of love & friendship as the highest honor a cat can bestow upon you! ❤️",
      "34": "You might not have chosen this cat, but it looks like this cat has chosen you, what an honor! The fact this little kitty keeps bringing you dead animals is like a welcome home gift for kitties. Cats do this to show their ultimate sign of respect. This kitty is communicating with you the only way it knows how to do.",
      "35": "You have in fact been chosen, as for the doorstop venture, well your new cat is giving you gifts. When they meow for you to come out and see, it's so you can see what a proud and capable hunter they are. If you plan on throwing away your “gifts\", make sure to do it where and when they don't see you doing it, otherwise they can get highly offended. Best Wishes to a new person to be owned, we've all been there so welcome to the club. If you're not sure of something by all means ask👍😁🌹💜😻🥰🇭🇲🙏🏻",
      "36": "Are you friends with this cat? This cat likes you a lot. Cats are not pack animals they normally don’t share food unless they like you. She/He thinks you can’t feed yourself and is trying to take care of you. It’s actually a HUGE compliment",
      "37": "Spayed female cats are the most likely to bring gory gifts to their owners. But they have their reasons. In the wild, cat mothers teach their young how to eat their food by bringing home dead or injured prey. By leaving a dead animal on the back porch, your cat is acting out its natural role as mother and teacher.\nDomestic cats are no different. But in this modern age of spayed domestic cats, many female felines have no young to whom they need to pass on their hunting wisdom.\nYou, her loving owner or believed loving person, represent her surrogate family. And frankly, she knows you would never have been able to catch that delicious mouse on your own.\nSo before you chastise your cat for her deadly habits, consider what her behavior really means. From eating to using the litterbox, your cat's habits are based on a highly evolved survival instinct.\nI had to answer this question because our cat just brought home a garter snake and was playing with it in the grass, tossing it high in the sky but it was not alive. Such fun!",
      "38": "Oddly enough the cat is showing you that it likes you/ respects you and this is an honor for you ~ a present Maybe the cat wants YOU as it’s owner :-)",

      "40": "This is really confusing me, a cat keeps leaving dead birds on my doorstep and meowing until I come out, I must stress that it is not even my cat, it happens almost every night and I don’t understand why my front door, any ideas?\nThis is a common behavior exhibited by cats… toward their beloved human. In other words, it appears you have probably been adopted. I would suggest you prepare to add a member to your household:\nget good food (not Whiskas, think: Applaws, Animonda… Sure, each pouch is 3 times more expensive than Whiskas, but it is also 3 times more nutritious, so you only have to feed the cat 1/3 as much, so it ends up costing the same), as well as\na litter box and some litter (I recommend Cat’s Best Gold - the pellets in the purple package rather than the chips in the red package, because the pellets create much less ambient dust and are therefore much better for your lungs).\nWhen you are ready, open the door and see what happens. If your kitty friend comes in, that will be the proof of the pudding: that you have been adopted :)",
      "41": "As others have said, this cat is totally in love with you and picked you as its special one.\nMy cat didn’t bring me whole animals like a bird. He brought me what looked like kidneys and hearts. Either he didn’t particularly like those parts or they were the best treasures he could find to bring. I was always touched by his generosity.",
      "42": "There is an old adage, dogs have masters, cats have servants.\nBut you ask, “why your front door?” Obviously, only servants use the side or back doors.

I’ll give you a picture.\nHis food is measured.\nHe thinks he’s starving.\nHe kills moles and brings them to the door mat to show me.\nThen he gives me the finger while he eats then, everything but their tail and intestine. It’s too horrible for me to look, let alone intervene.\n(Too fat to clean his own butt. No, I don’t help.)\nMy point is what others have said. Your cat is trying to take care of you. Have a talk with him. Let him inside and feed him. If you want to keep him, that is. Because once he knows you have food to share with him?\nIt’s all over.",
      "46": "Cats bring you dead animals as gifts in return for providing them with food, shelter and lots of love. There is a high chance that the cat was somebody's pet and is looking for a forever home and she thinks that she can trust you with the responsibility. In case you are looking for a pet, please let her in your world and fill it with love and fun.\nCheers!",
      "47": "Rags was born under the dumpster in the apartment complex where we lived at the time.\nWe had a cat.\nThis long-haired stray kept applying for the job of second cat.

I already knew that the feet were the least tasty part of a rodent, and the cat had to be terribly hungry. How could I resist?\nWe brought her in. It took two weeks to comb all the crud out of her hair.

Please hire her.",
      "48": "Cats, among the most intelligent of animals, sometimes have psychic ability. Cats don’t indiscriminately choose to connect with a person. You’re more-or-less qualified, a cat person. Or, to be honest, she might just have got the address wrong.\nI don’t want to scare you, but … maybe you heard about Oscar, the feline grim-reaper in a Rhode Island nursing home. Last I heard he was 100% accurate, predicting the end of patients’ lives. When he chose a bed to lie on, the nursing home folks knew the human there was going to expire that day. They were able to tell the family to get ready for goodbye — thanks to Oscar. And he would not leave the patient until the end came.",
      "49": "I read through a couple of answers and I wholeheartedly agree with them. Kitty is probably trying to impress you/leaving you a gift.\nBut I think it's possible the kitty might be trying to feed you. Studies have shown that cats probably think humans are helpless kittens.

      "2": "That's strange, I feel proud when I see these..",
      "3": "Reason why I moved out of The US to Asia was because I realised US was filled with Made in China goods and I use to always get my Chinese friends to Taobao what I see in the retail stores in the US and get it at a fraction of the price and that is with delivery added on top also.\nWhat also amazed me was that the quality sent from the Taobao would be of much higher quality than the one’s I see in US stores (In terms of sturdiness / feel). I asked my Chinese network why and they said its because US buyers are too poor so they ask for reduced rates for buying in really big bulks. The US buyers know and agree that the manufacturer cannot make a loss from the deal so the US buyer ask the Chinese manufacturers to manufacture sub quality standards since the US really needs such products and they don’t mind.\nIt’s unbelievable how much the US middleman must have made from the deal. They buy it supercheap and below normal quality that Chinese people would sell to themselves and they sell this at above average price to the US consumer. It’s a steal and all along the US consumers blame the Chinese quality on China lol.\nCan you imagine if China cannot meet Apple’s product build standard and precision that they would have no other way but to leave China and bring it back to The US? Same with other products, you give the client what they pay you for lol.",
      "4": "Well, yes a bit, actually.\nI lived in Vienna, Austria for 3 years. One of the highlights every year was the Christmas markets.\nIn addition to gluwein and pretzels, there were stalls filled with all sorts of cool stuff — from beautiful Christmas tree decorations to candles to Austrian style hats to sheepskin-lined slippers to keep one warm on a cold Austrian night.\nOne year at a Christmas market in Salzburg, I visited a stall selling Austrian hats. Imagine my surprise when I picked up a Tyrolean alpine hat like the one below\nOnly to see the tag inside that said: “Made in China.”\nYeah I was maybe a bit embarrassed to see that even deep in the Austrian heartland, supposedly ‘local’ products were made in China.",
      "5": "Take me as an example, when I lived in Sweden, seeing ‘made in China’ in the shopping, I would feel much more reassured because I am sure this item must be cheap than most items made in Europe and have good quality because many Chinese exported items have better quality than in China. Therefore, I would take that item, and leave others behind, which to some extent solves my difficulty in choosing.",

      "9": "Embarrassed? Why? The world runs off of products made in China. They should feel a sense of pride about that I’d think.",
      "10": "I feel more embarrassed about people like you who barely could make anything yourselves and rely on products that are made in China to live everyday, and who can barely afford anything while hoping to get the top quality.",
      "11": "Before World War I, Germany was also a very poor country. It didn't even have any industry, and the only little textile industry could not compete with France. At that time, German products were cast aside by the Germans, who said that the quality of German products was the worst. But the smart Germans did not give up. They went to France and the United Kingdom to steal technology and buy equipment. In just a few decades, Germany was already a very powerful industrial power by the time of World War II. The Chinese are managing the process.",
      "12": "no . I feel proud. the question should be do non Chinese feel embarrassed when they see made in China goods?",
      "13": "You get what you pay for.\nIf it is cheap, it should be bad and it is reasonable. But if it is expensive and it is bad, that is just embarrassing crap.\nI am proud that I found many stuff that are far below normal price but function perfectly well.",
      "14": "why？China produces goods all over the world, so that people in many underdeveloped countries in the world can get rid of the blackmail of high-priced and low-priced goods in Europe and the United States. Why should we be embarrassed.",
      "15": "Short answer: Yes. For the same money, a chinese person would usually prefer imports which are usually better quality or more stylish. Don’t hate me for spill the truth"

    "title": "Is mainland Chinas arrest of Jimmy Lai an effort to eliminate the top Hong Kong leadership that they cannot control",
    "answers": {
      "1": "What should you do to someone who cooperates with foreign forces to incite severe rioting, vandalism, arson and disruption to public life for a whole year in your own country?\nDo you think that such people should be allowed to go unpunished?\nI think it is right for Hong Kong police to arrest those involved and they should be severely punished.\nNo, Jimmy Lai has never been a leader of Hong Kong. and the arrest was made by Hong Kong police. You are wrong to blame mainland China for the arrest.\nOr perhaps this blaming of China is intentional?",
      "2": "Is mainland China's arrest of Jimmy Lai an effort to eliminate the top Hong Kong leadership that they cannot control?\nThanks for the A2A…but please note the following factually wrong things about this question:\n“mainland China” did not arrest Jimmy Lai. The Hong Kong police arrested Jimmy Lai for offences under a (new) Hong Kong law. The HK police do not report to mainland China.\nJimmy Lai is not among the “top Hong Kong leadership”. Not at all, and not even any kind of “top leader” in the anti-government camp. He is just a rich person who controls a popular broadsheet newspaper with tabloid style content, but he was only educated up to primary school level. (Even Lai would not call himself an intellect or a political leader. I knew him back in 1994/5, for work reasons (but never worked for his companies), some time after he was caught keeping an endangered black bear in a cage at home (garden or roof). Back then he did not pretend to be anything other than a businessman (an uncouth and unpleasant one). Back then he was not (yet) hypocritical and never held himself out to be “moral” or ideological in anyway - he made it clear he was only interested in making money. He made his fortune selling clothes (the Giordano brand). (Some ignorant people compared Lai to Murdoch (LOL x 1000!). Murdoch studied PPE in Oxford and has family background in publishing).\nThere is no effort to “eliminate” any “top Hong Kong leadership”. (What a ridiculous suggestion!) The anti-government camp is (1) not “top Hong Kong leadership” (2) a result of the elections in HK (3) has been thriving since the 1990’s for decades.\nArrests of suspects are efforts to “eliminate” crimes and not persons.\n“mainland China” does not need to “control” any actual or purported HK “leaders” as long as the constitution of Hong Kong (the Basic Law) gives China (a country) ultimate control over Hong Kong (a special administrative region).\nAfter taking into account the above, there is nothing left in the question.",
      "3": "Look at this way.\nOnce arrested, Jimmy Lai needs to be charged and then go to trial. Even if police had suspicions, they would need to investigate and may not lay any charges. Also the Department of Justice will consider the possibility of conviction before prosecuting the suspect, and courts will only convict defendants after the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt.\nThis is Hong Kong’s system of law enforcement process.\nSo if as you question that this is all politically driven, do you think the mainland government would risk embarrassment by forcing the police to arrest a public figure in a Special Administrative region and then no charges are laid or he is not prosecuted? *\nNo, because the Hong Kong government remains independent of the judiciary. Yes, the US-supported terrorists want the government to interfere in the rule of law (one of their 5 demands), but thankfully the government has resisted the demand. And if the mainland government tried to force its opinion on the HK judges, that is definitely something you would hear about from them.\n*(As per HK’s constitution, the Basic Law, China has responsibility for HK’s security and defence but they were clear in the Security law that most of the cases will be heard through the separate independent HK judicial system. If you don’t believe me, just read the laws. China is abiding by them, contrary to what the western news entertainment media says.)",
      "4": "Wow the day he was arrested the Next Media share price had went up 180+%. What sort of operation was that? Trading was close to HK$1 billion, something like US$120million.\nSo do we know what’s all that about?\n“mainland China’s arrest”? He was arrested under Hong Kong law, so, somehow certain ‘use of English’ been applied to try distort the facts? (I guess I can say the “mainland China” put Trump in his current position too? That’s also a nice, eye-catching headline.)\nThere was no law to deter the “Scorched-earth Hong Kong” movement until July 1st this year. In fact the law had no recourse, so whatever he had done was after that. In any case, the trial would be handled by the Hong Kong legal system which has been set up by the British and dominated by foreign judges, many “sympathetic” to activists.\nNo, the riots had been greatly controlled following the new law Mr. Lai’s arrest is not good to China, because it attracts headline such as the one put up here, and Mr. Lai’s ability to cause harm to Hong Kong had been greatly reduced anyway.\nFor Mr. Lai, he could have chosen to retire somewhere nicely, but somehow he had chosen to continue. His arrest mainly bring some joy to many people who had suffered by he deeds, somehow there’s a sense of justice given to those people. As I’m saying again, not so much “for China” and this move was not “mainland China’s arrest” as someone wanting the world to believe.",
      "5": "No. Jimmy Lai is not a leader nor possess any leadership quality. He is smart and crafty, trying to make use of CIA-NED for his own benefit such as collecting wealth, education and business arrangements for his sons in US.\nFurthermore, he just quarrelled with Joschua Wong for money matter. They both were trying to claim ownership for the funding received from CIA-NED to support the riots in Hong Kong. Please see the FB posting by Joschua. I'm just too lazy to find the link. I guese Joshua might probably have deleted the post due to the advice from the CIA-NED.\nHere is the discussion from the HK netizens mocking about their quarrel :",
      "6": "The arrest of Jimmy Lai is a demonstration of the will to act by CCP after the US enacted legislation to punish Hong Kong. It’s China telling the world Hong Kong is a part of China and China is not afraid of asserting its sovereignty over Hong Kong.\nJimmy Lai is not a top Hong Kong leader. He is a media mogul who owns the biggest tabloids in Hong Kong. His media empire was built on exploiting scandals and pedaling in rumors and innuendos. Jimmy Lai always courted controversy and confrontation as his media empire was built on exploitation of conflicts.",
      "7": "Since when did Jimmy Lai became part of Hong Kong’s ‘top leadership’? He was arrested by the HK police.",
      "8": "Does your country tolerate traitors?\nLai is a Chinese traitor who worked with a CIA agent. That is Lai was working for USA.\nUSA works for US benefit, not China incl Honkong. Even animals will not ruin their nest/home. Really, only humans will betray their home country. Because humans can be blinded by $$$. Lai is rich.\nAccording to HK national security law, Lai possibly has committed secession, subversion, terrorism & collusion with foreign power.\nIf found guilty, I certainly hope he will be sentenced for life imprisonment. In mainland China or Japan, it is death sentence for traitors. Really, he should be sent to mainland China for court hearing. And not in HK where there is no death sentence. HK is too inexperienced to handle traitors. So inexperienced that they would let secession, subversion & collusion simmer for over 20 years in HK without knowing or action.\nMany of Lai’s former accomplices have already switched to become witnesses against Lai. It is good news to HK.\nBack to your question. No, it is not because mainland China cannot control Lai. It is because there is a 1-country-2-systems between mainland China & HK. Lai (may have) committed a crime in HK & not on mainland China.",
      "9": "It wasn’t mainland China police that arrested Jimmy Lai.\nLai wasn’t top Hong Kong leadership.\nAny more inaccuracies you want answers to?",
      "10": "No! He is a criminal and should be jailed for life.",
      "11": "It seems that the person who asks this question wish Lai to be trialed in mainland China instead of Hong Kong.\nWhy do you have so much hate on Jimmy Lai?",
      "12": "Ridiculous.\nWhen did mainland China arrest Jimmy Lai?",
      "13": "First of all, it’s the Hong Kong government, not Mainland China, that arrested Jimmy Lai.\nSecondly, where did you get the idea that he is ‘top Hong Kong leadership’? He’s the owner of a money-losing newspaper (that obviously must be getting funding from somewhere other than sales).",
      "14": "😂Jimmy Lai is not a political leader but a staunch anti CCP nut who chose to be the CIA/NED lead point man in HK. His organisation provided funds for 2014 Occupy and last year’s riots. And before funds were dispersed, Jimmy Lai hired Mark Simons, an ‘ex CIA’ man as his personal assistant. Before national security laws, HK had no powers to investigate these links but it does now and US needed to withdraw many agents from HK is why it is selling its HK properties. 😂😂😂😂😂",
      "15": "In China, people are picked up for questioning or for the record.\n5 years or so ago, at Shanghai’s Huxi Mosque, dozens of Xinjiang vendors were correlled and put into police vans, as the district government wanted to change the location of their Friday festival.\nHong Kong leadership is determined by the Chinese govt.\nSo No to your question.",
      "16": "Correct. And I suspect the immediate release on bail is because of pressure applied by the US and it's allies.\nThe immediate bounce of the stock price shows how supportive HK people are to the value he holds.",
      "17": "What makes you think that the Chinese (PRC) government are not able to control the top HK leaders whom they have appointed? They had set up the HK liaison office for this purpose. The arrest of media mogul Jimmy Lai serves as a deterrent to any potential protesters or dissenting entrepreneurs in Hong Kong that they will end up in prison like him if they pursue the same goals as him.",
      "18": "No.\nUnlike the US, Hong Kong does not appreciate foreign countries meddling in its affairs.\nJimmy Lai is no ‘leader’, other than a patsy for the CIA.",
      "19": "Peter Herbert needs to go back to his home country if he thinks HK protesters are terrorists. If so then what are PRC ? The killers of 60m of their own people .\nThe biggest terrorist on earth equal to the Islamacists ?\nHyprocrisy",
      "20": "Jimmy Lai is arrested in Hong Kong and by Hong Kong, there is nothing to do with mainland China yet.\nJimmy Lai is charged for two different crimes, one is under the National Security Law, another is about dishonesty of the land usage.\nSo even without National Security Law, he is still be arrested under another crime. And the newspaper is not first-time being charged, it has many times to be charged Defamation.\nBefore National Security Law, he has already been arrested for another crime. NSL is just adding one more.\nAnd as I’ve said yet, because he maybe transferred to mainland China as his status for treason.",
      "21": "Jimmy Lai was jailed because he produced ‘news’ not permissible by the CCP. Only ‘fake’ news is allowed. However, all the other members of the former Democratic Party have been jailed without bail and most in solitary confinement. Many even without charges….yet. Most were charged with extremely serious crimes, such as ‘causing a public nuisance’ i kid you not, over a year in solitary confinement, without trial, for over a year!!! Others have been charged with ‘starting a petition’. You know your political philosophy sucks when you have to jail people for suggesting a more equitable approach just to force people to buy into it. Damn even the CCP know it’s utter lies. There lies the beauty of the ‘national security law’ you can imprison or ‘disappear’ anyone you like and you don’t even have to give a reason. Much simpler than all that fair trial stuff!",
      "22": "Jimmy Lai is not a leader besides the leader of a local newspaper. Of course, China is trying to eliminate every Hong Konger that they cannot control, leader or not.",

Quora is an intellectual site of a particular quality.\nJimmy Lai - Wikipedia\nLai pioneered a reader-centric philosophy with paparazzi journalism in Hong Kong based on publications such as USA Today and The Sun . [26] His best-selling Next Magazine and Apple Daily newspaper featured a mix of racy tabloid material and news items oriented to the mass market with plenty of colour and graphics that attracts a wide range of readers, some of whom are also critics of Lai and his ideology. [27] Hong Kong publications Edit Owing to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre , Lai became an advocate of democracy and critic of the People's Republic of China government. [28] He began publishing Next Magazine , which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting. He proceeded to found other magazines, including Sudden Weekly ( 忽然一週 ), Eat & Travel Weekly ( 飲食男女 ), Trading Express/Auto Express ( 交易通/搵車快線 ) and the youth-oriented Easy Finder ( 壹本便利 ). [29] In 1995, as the Hong Kong handover approached, Lai founded Apple Daily , a newspaper start-up that he financed with $100 million of his own money. [30] The newspaper's circulation rose to 400,000 copies by 1997, [31] which was the territory's second largest among 60 other newspapers. [32] According to Lai, he aspired to maintain freedom of speech in Hong Kong through Apple Daily . [33] In addition to promoting democracy, Lai's publications often ruffled feathers of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government. [34] In 2003, ahead of the record-breaking pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during July, the cover of Next Magazine featured a photo-montage of the territory's embattled chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa taking a pie in the face. The magazine urged readers to take to the streets while Apple Daily distributed stickers calling for Tung to resign. [35] In 2006, Sudden Weekly and Next Magazine ranked first and second in circulation for Hong Kong's magazine market. [36] Apple Daily became the No. 2 newspaper in Hong Kong. [36] In 2020, Lai launched an English version of Apple Daily . [37] Taiwan publications Edit Lai launched Taiwanese editions of Next Magazine in 2001 and Apple Daily in 2003, taking on heavily established rivals who made considerable effort to thwart him. Rival publishers pressed advertisers to boycott and distributors not to undertake home delivery. His Taiwan offices were vandalised on numerous occasions. [38] As the publications grew to have the largest readership in their category, the advertising boycotts ended. [36] In October 2006, Lai launched Sharp Daily (Shuang Bao in Mandarin), a free daily newspaper targeting Taipei commuters. [39] The company also launched Me! Magazine in Taiwan. [40] In building Taiwan's most popular newspaper, Apple Daily , and magazine, Next Magazine , Lai's racy publications were described as having a great impact on the country's hitherto staid media culture.

She should have your full support after being subjected to violence by the man who is supposed to be her safe person in life, and you abused her a second time by asking this question, and by being “embarrassed”. Asshole.",
      "3": "On the off chance this is a real question. GROW THE FUCK UP. She isn't the embarrassment to the family you are. She is your daughter and should come first.

      "5": "*She’s embarrassed BY my family.\nThere. I fixed it for you.\nBecause if you think that it’s a bad thing that she wants to get away from this man “just because he hits her” you are the disgrace as much as him. You are the embarrassment. Men should not hit women. Women should not hit men. Nobody should tolerate it and parents should want better for their kids.\nShame on you.",
      "6": "I hope this isn't a real question but let me tell you a story.\nAs a 23yr old wife, I left my husband because he hit me 2x. I took my daughter with me. My church shunned me for leaving the marriage. My family said things like “maybe you should just do what he says” or “you're an embarrassment”. I went back because I lacked support I needed.\nNot even 6months later, the police responded to a gunshot at my home. I had gotten a hold of his pistol and gave a warning shot. He had slapped our toddler. I had stepped in to protect her. I left in an ambulance and ended in ICU. He had knocked out multiple teeth, broke one arm, multiple ribs and other bones. I had severe internal bleeding. I was told that I'd never have more children due to his brutal raping me, in front of our daughter.\nSo, he only JUST hit her… it leads to much more. He will escalate. He will beat her. He may kill her. So, what are you going to do when you may have to visit your daughter in the hospital or bury her? WTH, is wrong with you? As a parent, we are supposed to PROTECT our children, even from abusive spouses. Get some counseling and put your priorities in better order. With your question, maybe she'd be better off without you in her life as well as him. Mine certainly became better when I cut those “family” members out and watched him get sentenced to prison for attempted murder.\nThat was almost 25yrs ago now… for anyone reading this that's curious, life worked out. A network of people helped my daughter and I escape. We had to stay hidden for awhile. I have 2 more beautiful sons and a husband that adores me (even my sassy side). We have built a wonderful farm that I look forward to someday sharing with my grandchildren. Life worked out and is good… mostly. Sometimes I will have a random nightmare but they are very seldom these days.\nDUE TO QUESTIONS, I am adding this to my original answer.\nWhen I fired that warning shot I had already been assaulted and hot numerous times.\nAlso, my sons are adopted….. but they are still my sons. Being adopted does not change that we are family.",

      "9": "You have that backwards - your wife’s husband is an embarrassment to your family, but mostly to her.\nInstead of cherish, honor and protect, he has chosen to abuse and dishonor.

      "10": "You've got to be kidding me?? You seriously think it's ok to hit a woman especially your wife?? What you should be doing as a parent is helping your daughter get away from her abuse husband and not being so dumb worried about anyone else's opinion of whether or not it's an embarrassing situation which it is only embarrassing to your poor daughter. What the fuck is wrong with you?? I grew up in a house where my dad would hit my mom if there wasn't enough seasoning in that nights dinner. I married a man who thought it was ok to hit me and degrade me. After only 2 years I divorced his ass. And he kept up that cycle of abuse on every woman that he got involved with over the years, including the children he spawned. It took me 10 years to remarry and my now late husband NEVER laid a hand on me. Get off this and any other public forum and go help your daughter before she winds up in ICU or dead!!

You should be glad that your daughter left that poor excuse of a man. Imagine having to bury your child because her husband or significant other killed her.

Your priorities are wrong, your daughter’s welfare should be the priority, not what the “neighbours” may think. It’s none of their business.

I wouldn’t put up with physical abuse ever. I don’t need a marriage that badly. But as I age, I can also understand that not everyone can say that: there could be a lot of dependencies. Who am I to judge?\nThe women I move with wouldn’t put up with abuse. And if we were to invert genders in this situation, do you think a man would tolerate his wife beating him up in private or on public? He doesn’t deserve it either.\nDivorce is a sensitive topic and not everyone states the real reasons out in public. Someone I know stated to the court that she found that she was of alternate sexuality and hence wanted to dissolve her marriage. It was by mutual consent as the man was very supportive. But the courts said there was no such provision in Indian civil courts. So, she had to choose incompatibility as the official grounds for divorce.\nDivorce is tough. So, if you want to be a good parent, offer your support if you can. If not, do the least you can: keep your judgements to yourself. Her divorce is about her. Why do you make it about yourself? Why do you give yourself so much of self importance?",

Something is wildly wrong within your family if they don't support your daughter protecting her life.\nWhen I was 6 years old I walked into my moms bedroom. She was sitting on the edge of her bed. Her coked out boyfriend was standing over her with a gun pointed directly at her head. I ran out of the house as fast as my tiny little legs would go.

He walked fast as he could to my house, his wife had taken me inside of their house. He walked straight into my house, into the bedroom pointed that shotgun at my mom's boyfriend and told him to get the fuck out. He told him if he ever saw him again he would use his gun without hesitation! That scumbag coke head never came back!\nI will never forget that day. I am 45 now and could literally describe every single detail down to clothes, weather and the feeling of that sweet old country man saving my mom.\nThe point of my story is that people especially your family but people in general should always be willing to help in any domestic violence situation.

Sometimes if you had not seen them in a while you would wonder if they actually made it out. I remember my mom would pour over the newspaper looking at the obituaries to see if any of the kids or their mothers were listed. I was young. Maybe a teenage and my parents hid that side of the world to me. I did not understand it or the cycle but I saw the effect it had in my mother. As I got older I went into social work to help those people. And sadly I became one of those victims. My ex husband was abusive but made sure no one could see anything especially since we lived with my parents at the time. In fact he hit me and tried to make me miscarry when he found out I was carrying a girl. When my daughter was six months old he was sentenced to a 10 year sentence in jail for raping a 14 year old. That is when I divorced him. My mother was my biggest supporter. I’m not saying it’s been easy and I e had people look down on me and even had people tell my mother that they should not help me.

She can divorce him even if he didn’t hit her. It is her right and her life.\nAs long as she doesn’t come to you for advice or ask for your retirement money or force you to let her inside your home, you have no right to tell her to adjust with her violent husband.",
      "19": "You don’t have to do anything.\nJust be grateful that you somehow unintentionally managed to raise a strong woman.\nShe seems to be a mature adult with enough self-respect that prompted her to divorce the man “because” he hit her.\nHer decision has already portrayed her as an independent self-reliant woman who doesn’t need your approval to take major steps in life.\nYou should be ashamed of expecting her to sacrifice for a pretentious family which cares more about its image in the orthodox society than their daughter’s well-being.\nRealistically, people don’t walk out of a marriage after a single unfortunate incident. They learn to recognize patterns. They let go of some arguments and abuses during the initial years. They give the relationship time to heal. They offer second or third chances.\nHowever, each person has a different breaking point. To an outsider it may look like “just a small slap” out of uncontrolled emotions which deserves forgiveness, but to the spouse who has been living with this abuser for a long time knows with experience that it is the start of the end of their marriage. We, as a society or as a family, should not judge. We generally know a half-baked, one-sided story.\nRecently, a relative of mine walked out of her husband’s home with her kids because of the verbal abuse and mental torture she was experiencing.\nHer parents had to be convinced to not make her go back, as they had done several times in the past. Why? Because of their belief that marriage is supposed to be forever, and the hope that things will eventually become better.\nOur daughters are not born to be sacrificed in the name of marriage. Love them, support them, educate them, treat them with equality, and see how they take care of you even better than a son would.",

Maybe you would be happy to see any future grandchildren beaten about as well? Maybe visits from child protection and the police would not embarrass you at all?

Almost 13 years ago I left my then husband in the late evening after he threw me against a wall. Our at the time toddler woke up and came out of her room crying for him to let go of me. I scooped her up, grabbed my keys and luckily had shoes on and left that second with her with the clothes we were wearing. As I walked out the door he told her to say good bye to mommy because when she came back she would never see her again. I never went back for that to happen. Where did I go? My PARENTS HOUSE. Now, if I didn’t have amazing supportive parents (aka - if I had parents like you)I might not be here. So what you do is support your daughter, and help her get out and move on with her life without him.",

Her feelings were deeply hurt. It wasn’t a physical pain but an emotional one. If I could have strung that bastard up by the end of his dick, I would have done. In front of everybody.

You are her parent but you don't support her when she's being smacked around. Start drafting your acceptance speech for mother of the year. So you know, 1 hit 1 time isn't the end of it. These behaviors escalate. Next time it'll be a shove into the wall, down the stairs, with a weapon…so when exactly is the point for you when it's not ok? When she's in the ER? On life support?

      "34": "First of all I really think this is a troll question just asked for attention but if this is real just ask her to move and live independently having a mom/dad like you is worse than facing domestic violence.

Are you one of those people who believe women should put up with someone’s abuse?\nIf I were your daughter, I’d leave the SOB, and I’d tell you to never speak to me again.\nShe needs to go find some people who will love, cherish, protect, and support her.\nShe sure isn’t going to find that where she currently is.\nAnd YOU need to go get your head examined!

My guess from your statement is nothing. Something you may regret when you are attending her funeral. One act of violence is not a one off- it escalates and gets worse. Do your research- do you know the number of women killed by a partner every year- you will be and should be shocked by this information.\nYour daughter is not the embarrassment you are!

Hmmmm, seems to me it’s the other way around. YOU are an embarrassment to her and she should cut all ties with you. My God lady, think about what you are saying. If your Granddaughter called you with the same scenario, would you still be asking this question? I raised 3 sons and no daughters. If any of my 3 daughter-in-laws told me my son hit her; HE would be the embarrassment and I would support HER any way I could.",

I told him then and there if he ever struck me that would be the last time he saw me. Yes, we have had arguments in the many years we have been married but there has never been anything physical. A woman has to stand up against abuse. If you let it happen the first time and don’t stand up for yourself, it will continue to be the norm. Even some men have to stand up against being abused by women. Physical, mental and verbal abuse are all WRONG.",
      "41": "This question seems like a joke to me, is this for real? If it is then i would like to know the person who asked this. What kind of a parent says his daughter is an embarrassment to the family for divorcing a man who hit her.

Sorry to say this but you are the real embarrassment here.",

I'm assuming you've never experienced physical abuse by this ignorant question. “What should I do with her.” How about be her support system instead of shunning her back into this asshole’s arms. I can't believe this. I wish I could have kids and you just simply don't give a fuck about yours. Shame on you.",

In public?\nAt what point would you start feeling the righteous anger on behalf of your daughter?\nThink hard and long.\nIf you cannot contemplate this, if you cannot question your son-in-law for embarrassing your family (and his family), then please get out of your daughter's life.

No one should ever hit another person, he hit her once, he’ll hit again, and again, and again until she is permanently disabled or dead.

You should be supporting her, whether it’s letting her move back home until she can get back on her feet, providing financial assistance, helping her find/pay for an excellent divorce lawyer or just being there for her to talk to WITHOUT judging her and don’t you dare say “I told you so” or any other crap like that\nbut instead you’re ashamed? Wtf is wrong with you? I’m guessing you’re also abusive towards your child. Oh sure you probably didn’t hit her, but I bet you were/are verbally abusive to her\npull your head out of your ass if you want to have any sort of relationship with your daughter going forward, and see a psychologist to find out wtf is wrong with you",

You should be commending her because she is getting out of.the abuse, however with how you put it on here something tells me she not only needs to divorce her abusive husband but you as her parent as well.\nYou should be embarrassed for even asking this damn question. You sir or ma'am should never be allowed to reproduce again. Sounds like your mama should have learned to swallow. I have a feeling you learned this abusive behavior from them.

      "1": "Consider the humble toaster.\nMade in China for $2.\nSold in the United States for $55.\nProfit to various parties in this transaction $53.\nConsider the alternative. Make it in the United States.\nMade in the USA for $87\nSold in the USA for $140\nProfit to the various parties in this transaction: $53\nNow, suppose you have two companies making toasters. One manufactures in China, and the other manufactures domestically in the United States.\nMade in USA price = $140\nUSA company made in China price = $55\nAll things considered, same functionality but different price. Most American people would purchase the Chinese made toaster.\nIt’s called reality. Deal with it.",
      "2": "Thanks for request.\nThe US is a lot less important to China than most Americans think and China is a lot more important to the US economy that most Americans think.\nUS companies invest billions in China every year, to grow their profits which drives the US stock market and benefits many people's retirement funds.\nUS companies earn hundreds of billions in revenue every year in China. Example - GM sells more cars in China than the US. Meanwhile Chinese goods makes keeps US inflation considerably lower, that it would otherwise be. In other words US standard living for the middle class and lower class has benefitted greatly as a result.\nUS politicians wanting to decouple from China is a political strategy, not an economic one. Since US politicians do not care about improving the lives of its people, it resorts to defecting the focus of Americans away from internal dysfunction within the country.",
      "3": "If you live in America look at the label on your clothes, your dinnerware, your cheaper technology, etc. A full 80% of what the U.S. imports comes from China. It is either made in China or parts assembled in China.\nIt's simple math, China has 4× the population and workforce. The wages in China are below the U.S. equivalent but it costs less to live there so the benefit of this exchange goes to the U.S. companies who choose to use China to manufacture their products because cheaper labor means higher profits and profits are all that matters to U.S. companies, not politics.\nChina is willing to endure all the criticism, trade sanctions and military posturing because, in the end, China comes out the winner, receiving hundreds of billions/year from their “enemy\". Who's the smart country here?!",
      "4": "The US continues to do business with China for several reasons:\nEconomic benefits: The US and China have a large and complex economic relationship, with trade and investment ties worth billions of dollars. This relationship provides economic benefits for both countries, including access to cheaper goods for US consumers, and access to the large and growing Chinese market for US businesses.\nStrategic interests: The US and China also have important strategic interests, including cooperation on issues such as climate change, global health, and non-proliferation. Maintaining economic ties with China is seen as a way to build trust and facilitate cooperation on these issues.\nCompetition: While China is indeed becoming a major global economic power, the US still has significant economic and military capabilities, and the two countries are seen as competitors, rather than enemies. Doing business with China can be seen as a way to maintain a level of influence and engagement, and to keep an eye on China's economic and strategic developments.\nDependence: Many US companies have significant operations in China, and rely on access to the Chinese market and supply chain for their growth and competitiveness. This dependence can make it difficult for the US to take strong action against China, even if there are concerns about human rights abuses or unfair trade practices.\nIn short, the US continues to do business with China for a combination of economic, strategic, and political reasons. While there are certainly challenges and risks associated with this relationship, the US and China are likely to continue to have a complex and interdependent economic relationship for the foreseeable future.",
      "5": "Unlike China, the U.S. ‘government’ doesn’t choose what the majority of the products on our shelves are, local and foreign capitalists do- and they succeed or fail based on the U.S. consumers; which is most often based on their view of price/performance parameters. The U.S. really doesn’t manufacture anything (except military toys, which is suddenly on the increase). Any manufacturing in the U.S. of much volume is a foolish direction, as a ‘new and successful’ design will be quickly displaced by a cheaper imported clone.",
      "6": "Your question is technically incorrect.\nChina got to be where they are today because of FDIs (foreign direct investment). And this is not due to nor controlled by any government fiat.\nThe U.S. keep doing business with China? It’s individuals and multinational companies doing business with China, not the U.S., i.e., the government. Especially in the West where its rentier capitalists who rule, capital goes where optimum return is earned regardless of their country’s government policies. The world’s 1% earns rents and passive income and does not do manufacturing.\nAs such, while during the trump and now the Biden years that the U.S. has been imposing sanctions and tariff on China, U.S. citizens and multinationals continue to trade with China resulting in increasingly greater Chinese goods imported into the U.S. China continues to provide the best price and services.",

      "8": "Because they make huge profit profits out of China which the American people never see as it gets lost in the tax havens .\nFor you see the supposedly 500 billion balance of payments the USA has with China is really only about 200 billion which the Chinese get the rest of it goes into Yankee pockets but your president doesn’t tell you that so it’s all a big con without it American stock exchange would collapse and 60 million Americans would have no pension",
      "9": "In an \"exit interview\" with The Wall Street Journal, Lawrence Summers, director of the US National Economic Council, pointed out that history will judge the US by its economic and political performance in adapting to the rise of China as a great power. American manufacturing faces significant challenges in becoming and remaining competitive in the face of China's advances, and the national economic policies we choose will affect how well we meet those challenges. It is crucial that the US trade deficit is not allowed to balloon as the economy recovers. At present, the United States still has room to expand its service industry and agricultural exports, but the key to recovery lies in improving the competitiveness of the US manufacturing industry.",

    "title": "What is one ridiculous reason for which you got kicked out of class",
    "answers": {
      "1": "I got kicked out of class for trying to write the correct answers on my test.\nSo, a bit of background here. I was in 6th grade at that time, and we were doing something called “Common Core”. At my school, each student was placed into a group of about four people, and they worked together for an entire chapter.\nThe day of the Team Test came, where you have to work with your entire group to complete a test.\nI, being as lucky as I am, was placed with a bunch of guys who didn’t know anything about math. All they talked about was football, girls, and sex.\nAs the teacher handed out the tests, the guys chuckled and said, “Ha! We got this. It’s so easy, I’ll ace this test.” *insert laughter and high-fives all around*\nThey started on the first problem.\n“Well, x is clearly five.” (read in a snarky, arrogant voice)\n“Well, I mean, I didn’t really get that - ”\n“Whatever, dumbass. We don’t need your help.”\nThey snickered and continued.\nI was really pissed, but I just continued solving the problems.\nI worked alone, even though we were supposed to be working as a group. I watched as they got problem after problem wrong. Each time, I tried to correct them, and each time, they dismissed me.\nI finally had enough.\n“Guys. I know that you’re getting all of them wrong. Let me help and show you how to do it.”\nThey all looked at each other. Then one of them raised their hand and called the teacher over.\n“[insert teacher name here], Audrey is being uncooperative. We tried to work with her, but she refused and won’t let us look at her answers.”\nThe teacher glared at me and asked, “Is that true, Audrey?”\nI tried to explain.\n“Well, I was trying to help them but - “\n“No buts. Go outside and sit there. I’ll see you after class.”\nThe entire class ooh’ed, as I was usually the goody-two shoes.\nAfter class, I tried to explain, but the teacher wouldn’t let me. Luckily, she only let me off with a stern talking-to and an email to my parents.",
      "2": "Once, in a physics class in school, the teacher roared “Lang! Get out!”\nSomewhat surprised I picked up my books and went and stood outside the door. Thirty seconds later the door opened and the teacher poked his head out.\n“Lang! Get in! I meant Foster.” and turning to the class - “Foster! Get out!”",
      "3": "I Said “21”\nIt was an answer to a math problem.\nOur 5th grade teacher thought that the “21” vine came from an “inappropriate” rap song (As most people know it came from a vine of a boy answering the question what’s 9+10 “21” In a high pitched voice).\nKnowing that, my friends and I would say that whenever we could. We would get these things called “time charges” where we would fill out what we did wrong and miss recess. Most kids would not want to have this happen to them, but we saw it as a game. (I have no idea how we thought this)\nThat day I had been saying “21” a lot. I already had 4 time charges, when he asked us this: “Class, who can tell me what 84 divided by 4 is? If the first person who says it gets it right we get one more marble.” (for our jar)\nAs you may have thought would happen I screamed out as loud as I could “21!”\n“Zach, go outside and think about what you did,” My teacher said in a panicked voice, as if it was really bad that I said that.\n“But all I said was the answer” I whined\n“GO TO THE PRINCIPAL’S NOW!”\nSo I went to the principal's office for correctly answering a math problem.",
      "4": "For taking notes in class.\nLet me start off by saying that I've always been a great student. I've never been a problem child and I've only once been kicked out of a classroom.\nWhen I was in seventh grade, I decided to take a technology education class. I was excited to learn about how to use an iMac computer and find out about all of the adobe products that I still use today (I'm now in my junior year of high school.)\nI was so excited that, despite hating taking notes, I pulled out a piece of lined paper and pencil and started jotting down key information about Adobe Photoshop. However, in the middle of the lecture, my instructor called me out in front of the whole class. His exact words were “If you're not going to pay attention in my class, then you might as well leave. I'll call you back when I'm done talking.” Of course, I tried explaining myself but he cut me off and disregarded it.\nNeedless to say, I was pissed off, embarrassed in front of my peers, and have a grudge against that teacher to this day. A class that I was ecstatic to take turned into a class that I couldn't stand in one period. Just repeating this story still gets my blood boiling.\nSo yes, I got kicked out for taking notes on class.",
      "5": "For trying to keep warm during WINTER.\nSo I live in Australia and 40°c(107° F) days are the norm, usually humid and horrible.\nThis particular school had two uniforms, a formal that for girls consisted of a white blouse and a skirt, and a sport uniform which was school branded shorts or tracksuit pants and a polo.\nNow for junior secondary, in the formal uniform no tights, long socks or long pants were allowed. At all. For girls in winter we had to freeze.\nSo this day was about 6°c (42.6°F, extremely cold for us living in the tropical weather). It had been cold the last few days, and it was what they called a “formal Friday” so that morning I wore my blouse as usual but instead of the skirt I wore my tracksuit pants and got my dad to write me a note.\nI arrived at school and my form teacher let me off, agreeing it was cold. I went to my first class math, and that teacher let it go aswell. Then I had Science and it wasnt the actual teacher that sent me to the BSR (behavior support room) it was one of the three really nasty teacher aids we had in the class.\nApparently it isn't ladylike to wear pants.\nSo I went off, kicked out of class and condemned to the room in which they send people who carry drugs or weapons around at school, as well as those who have small nike ticks on their socks.\nThe ever grumpy BSR teacher started going off at me for trying to be warm and I told her calmly that I wasn't going to freeze because of their sexist ideologies.\nShe sent me to the office.\nThe office lady gave me a copy of the dress code. At this point I was cold, angry, and missing my favourite class (Home economic).\nI told her to shove the dress code up her ass.\nAnnnd got called in to the deputies office. She made me apologize and sent me home. But not before calling my dad who told her it was idiotic that we had to wear skirts and freeze.\nSo that's how I was kicked out of class for trying to keep warm, like any normal human being.",
      "6": "When I was in primary school, I was a bit of a nerd. I was popular, don't get me wrong, but one of those kids that always does as the teacher said. As such, I was the one that the naughty kids had to sit next to so they'd behave.\nIn year three, when we were about seven years old, I was sat next to the naughtiest boy in the class, let's call him Freddie. We sat in one of those two seater desks, like this\nExcept it was wooden. We both sat along the long edge.\nOne day, Freddie was tilting back on his chair, as one does. However, as teachers are prone to do, our teacher told him off because it was dangerous and he could fall and hurt himself or another person. Freddie, being Freddie, ignored this warning and continued tilting back on his chair until he tilted a little too far. Filled with the panic that can only be experienced when falling backwards while seated, he clutched at the nearest thing to him in order to steady himself. Unfortunately, a flimsy school desk was no match for him, and as he clung to it for dear life, he brought the desk and all its contents crashing down on top of the both of us, me falling to the floor beside him, pinned down by what felt like a boulder balanced across my stomach.\nFor some reason still unknown to me, instead of looking at the evidence available to her, Miss White, our teacher, saw a badly behaved boy who'd already been told off several times for tilting back on his chair, and me, a model student who was too scared to even breathe wrong, and decided that we had conspired together to disrupt the class, and sent us both out. Not to the nurse, to check we weren't injured from falling backwards, hitting our heads, and being pinned under a table, but out into the corridor to be disciplined. I was an innocent bystander, and yet I still got told off and a letter home! But I'm not bitter… not at all…",
      "7": "10th grade, bible lesson (not a religious school, just part of the Israeli curriculum). Anyway, the teacher is trying to give us an idea of the civilizations of the fertile crescent during biblical times, and talks about the Sumerians.\nTeacher: “The Sumerians were a people who lived between the fourth and second centuries BCE”\nMe (raising hand)\nTeach: “Yes, Rechavia?”\n“Um, you meant the fourth to second millenniums BCE.”\nHer (derisively): “No, the fourth to second centuries.”\nMe: “Um, teacher, that’s wrong. Also impossible. By the fourth to second century BCE all the fertile crescent was part of the Persian Empire.”\nHer: “Rechavia, be quiet and don’t argue with me.”\nSo happened that the next day we had another lesson with the same teacher. I brought an encyclopedia with me, and when she asked something I raised my hand, but instead of answering what she asked I began to read the entry for Sumeria, which in the first paragraph placed that fascinating civilization in its proper time.\n“Rechavia, go see the principal.”\nSo I go, and tell him why I was sent.\nHim:\n<PicardFacepalm.jpg> - (Turns out you’re not allowed to use memes! They actually collapsed my answer for having that image… Whatever.)\nEDIT: The difference between what I think is a kick-ass answer and what y’all turn out to like never ceases to amaze. Thanks for all the (most ever) upvotes!",
      "8": "In my sophomore year, my high school tried a stupid (and possibly illegal) policy of no restroom breaks during class because of prior hall incidents from some prankster seniors.\nDuring English, Kurt—my friend and our resident class clown—told the teacher he needed to go to the restroom. She denied his request.\nSome time passed and he began to squirm. He raised his hand and when she called on him, he announced, I've really gotta pee. She replied that he could not use that word. So he asked, please let me go urinate. Again, she rejected him.\nMore ticks off that slow-ass wall clock happened. Of course, Kurt had become animated by now, crossing his legs, pressing his hand in his groin, and fidgeting in a comical way. The teacher knew she'd lost the class because he had our full attention.\nSo, she told him that per the policy, she couldn't allow him out of the class. She suggested that he think of something else until class ended in twenty minutes. Fine, he said, I've thought of something else. He walked over to a potted bush in the corner, unzipped his pants and peed. The teacher yelled, that's not what I meant… Too late. He let out this loud ahhh.\nHe got study hall suspension for a week, but the no restroom policy was shut down permanently.",
      "9": "In 9th grade science class, I got kicked out of class for saying \"masticate.\" The teacher started yelling at me for using \"filthy words\" in her class and for being a \"pervert\" then sent me out to the hall to wait for the bell.\nMy English teacher passed by and wanted to know what I was doing out in the hall (I had never gotten into any trouble with her so it was out of the ordinary). I told her what happened, she opened the door to the classroom and told the science teacher that she's an idiot and to read a dictionary.\nThe whole faculty thought it was hilarious and jokes ensued for the rest of the semester.",
      "10": "In 7th grade, my school hired Caitlin Moore, a new gym teacher straight out of college. She could often be oversensitive and volatile. She routinely overreacted to anything, especially things that infringed on her authority. She wasn't there to teach us anything. I don't think she gave a hoot in hell about us.\nThe teacher refused to enforce any kind of order and would not start class activities until she had our full attention. The problem was that there were a handful of people that never calmed down or gave the teacher their attention so she could give directions. She didn't care, so she just sat and waited and texted people on her phone forever and let the handful of delinquents run the show because she got paid either way. This resulted in the majority of the class being very bored and being required to waste valuable time so that the jerks could be jerks and do their jerk activities for as long as they pleased at our expense.\nWell, one day I'd had enough of this. I had previously tried to get Ms. Moore to enforce order but to no avail. I took control and tried to organize the idle students into some sort of game of something, anything to alleviate the boredom. Many of they agreed with me but before we could even form teams, Ms. Moore shut us down. Her response was a swift and solid yell at me that went something along the lines of, \"Excuse me! I am the teacher here! If you don't like how I run this class, go to the office!\"\nSo I did. I said, “alright, I will,\" in my best courageous but coolly defiant tone, turned around and marched out, trying to keep my dignity intact with as short pause at the door and glance over my shoulder at my peers.\nI went to the office and turned myself in and then filled out a detention report form. They staff was a bit bewildered why I was there and frankly, so was I. The principal went and asked Ms. Moore what had transpired and then returned and handed me ANOTHER detention report form. The first charges were disrespecting a teacher. I could live with that, she deserved it. But the real kicker was the additional charges of leaving class without permission. I guess she lied to the principal because I know I heard her say that I could go to the office. So I got double detention for doing what she said I could.\nEdit: People, why do you keep upvoting this one? I've written some much better answers, but this one is consistently more popular. I don't get it.",
      "11": "Just today I was kicked out of class for drawing a pinwheel\nI drew an image similar to this, and basically what happened is as follows.\nI saw my friend (Who is an artist) drawing a windmill and I said to him\n“Wow I could never draw something as good as that”\n“If you tried it couldn’t be that bad” he replied\n“Alright I’ll show you” I said.\nI took out a sheet of paper and drew something along the lines of what is above. I wrote the words “horrible drawing” on the paper and I proceeded to pass the paper to him.\nAs this is going on I see a teacher walking up to me. (This is a free period so it isn't a lesson)\nShe looks at me in horror and then calls the office on the phone. 5 minutes later she tells me “pack your stuff up and go to the office, bring that paper too”.\nI went to the office not knowing what was going on. After 5 minutes of sitting there in the office, the principal proceeds to come out and call me in to her office.\nShe asked “What did you draw here?”\n“I drew a pinwheel, why, is there something wrong with it?” I replied.\nShe sighs in relief\n“I just got a call from your teacher saying that you drew a Swastika”\nYes you read that right, a swastika. She believed that I drew a swastika in class, even though it went to the left and looked like above.\nShe then interrogated me for the next 20 minutes to see if I was a terrorist/nazi or whatever. Luckily, this principal knew I am a good person and just said “Don’t draw anything around her, she might get the wrong idea again”\nI was left off with a warning, but I was kicked out of the class for drawing a pinwheel",
      "12": "This wasn’t me, but a classmate in high school.\nWe had a substitute who regularly showed up at our school. She was old, and had a reputation for being strict with the students.\nOne day, she was in our Language Arts class, a class where we didn’t really get assigned any work. So one of the boys used the class period to do his math homework.\nWhen he pulled out his calculator, this old lady lost her shit. This was the calculator:\nShe thought it was a cell phone, and wouldn’t listen to everyone in the class confirm that it was, in fact, a graphing calculator.\nShe sent him to the office, where he was not punished. Everyone had a good laugh in the end, as uncomfortable as the situation was.",
      "13": "I was sent out of class for being allergic to crackers.\nI was in kindergarten. Having Celiac Disease, I had been taught to recite to anyone who gave me food to say “I am allergic to wheat, barley, oats, and rye!” Back then most people I encountered had no idea what gluten free was so it was a constant problem to explain it to everyone. I am certain my mother had also informed the school of this. In addition, I had already had problems with this teacher because she insisted I could not read (I could!), that no one could read until 1st grade. Until then, apparently, one can only “look at pictures”. I loved reading and really usually trusted adults, so this distressed me that she was a teacher and could be so wrong (remember I was only 5).\nSo one day another teacher had been watching the class while my teacher was out. After awhile, I saw my teacher returning with some bags of food. While I could not see all the food in the bags, I did see a big box of saltines.\nIt wasn’t this brand, but you get the idea. I knew that these crackers were not ok for me to eat because my mom liked them and often had them in the house. I was really curious what the teacher was going to have us do.\nShe had us all sit in a circle criss cross applesauce style and announced we were going to learn today about our sense of taste. She then brought out blindfolds and said that she was going to blindfold us and put food in our mouths and were were to guess what it was by taste alone. I quickly got very worried. I raised my hand and said, “I cannot have wheat, barley, oats, or rye! I need to know if any of that is in the food.” She replied, “I can’t tell you what is in it, that would spoil the lesson! The point is for you to guess the food from its taste alone.” She then put the blindfold on me.\nNow, for all I know, the teacher may have not intended to give me any crackers and if she had I would not have died but would have gotten a stomach ache and thrown up at the worst, but she did not attempt to allay my worries so I began to panic. I then, in my 5-year-old mind decided that it was her evil plan to kill me. Perhaps her motive was that I had kept insisting I could read when kindergarteners cannot read? I didn’t know why but I was sure she planned feed me crackers till I died while blindfolded. I began to tightly close my mouth and refused to let her put in any food and I cried. I kept trying to see out the small gaps in the blindfold near my nose, hoping to see what was in her hand so my head thrashed about in a strange manner.\nShe sent me to the principal’s office. I had never before been to the principal's office and didn't even know where it was. I remember another teacher helping me find it.\nI told my story to the principal who was very kind and my mother was called. I remember her coming to the school and talking to the principal while I waited in the office lobby. I will never know what was said behind that door because my mom oddly doesn’t recall the incident but I still remember what happened after that. It was near the end of the school year already and when my mother left I was placed in a different class for the last bit of school (I don’t know how long it was, probably a few days to a week, or maybe two weeks max). In the new class there were desks and kids older than me, so I assume now that it was a 1st grade room. The new teacher did not expect me to do what the class was doing and only gave me worksheets, books to read, and coloring pages all day. When I finished one, she’d hand me some more. I loved this and was happy for the rest of the school year.",
      "14": "For quoting Shakespeare.\nI was sitting in my language arts class, and the teacher asked, “who in here considers themselves a leader?” Everyone except me raised their hands. “Who considers themselves a follower?” I raised my hand. He asked, “\"Eric, why do you consider yourself a follower?” While the class snickered in the background, I said, “As Shakespeare once said, ‘The fool doth think he's wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool’.” I was sent to the principal’s office for calling the rest of the class fools.",
      "15": "Well, once I was kicked out of class for sharpening my pencil.\nYep. For sharpening my fucking pencil.\nIt was pretty dumb, really. I was in second grade, and one day my teacher had to talk with the coordinator or something, I don't remember, but it's not important. What matters is that she had to get out of the classroom for a couple minutes.\nYou see, whenever she did that, she would pick one random student to “take care” of the class for her and report anything bad students would do (you know, getting up, messing with their friends, anything that involved not doing the task that was supposed to be done).\nThat time, she picked a girl called Brida. You see, me and Brida… well, we hated each other, basically. She would always pick fights with me (which wasn't hard in those days, I had some… anger issues) and I wasn't supposed to do anything about it because of that whole “boys shouldn't hit girls” thing (which in my opinion, is bullshit to a seven year old, since there are basically no differences between children bodies at that age). And yes, I know hitting other people is bad regardless of gender, but keep in mind that we are talking about about a little boy who had to do anger management therapy when he was about seven or eight years old, so at the time I didn't give a fuck. But I digress.\nAnyway, on that day I was calmly doing my math lessons when my pencil tip broke. So naturally I was going to sharpen it. I had one of these:\nSo, of course, I had to get up and throw away the wood shavings on the little trash bin close to the door. And it was all fine until my teacher came back and Brida told her I got up and walked around the classroom. When I told the teacher I only went to the bin to throw away the shavings, she said it didn't matter because I should have asked for permission before (which, btw, was never required at all, before AND after that day) and kicked me out for the following hour. So there I was, having to explain to the monitors that I was outside because my teacher kicked me out of the classroom.\nFor sharpening my fucking pencil.",

He opened the door and told me to report to the principal. So, within fifteen minutes of entering a new school, I was at the principal’s office. That’s how I got noticed, and not in a good way. It took me a while for my brain to catch up with my mouth.\nArmand Piet Wildeman, not Wilde Man.",
      "17": "Tonal drawing with a pencil.\nPretty simple everyone knows what is meant by a ‘tonal drawing’.\nThat is everyone except myself, I was a 6′4″ 12 year old gangly and spotty idiot.\nI was beloved by the teachers in our school as most were veterans of the Second World War and were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder so they would vent their fury on me usually through a constant stream of sarcastic comments during lessons as being tall made me a prominent target.\nNo, I did not enjoy school but there was the odd lesson given by a younger teacher who was not a sporty masochistic ‘jock’ in which I could relax in and enjoy.\nThat was until I unintentionally really hacked off the 28 year old art teacher, a Mr. Littlewood who was a most mild mannered man and had never ever been known to lose his temper in class.\nWe all filed into the art room and I somehow did not notice the bowl of fruit on a table in the center of the room because as usual I was daydreaming away happily planning what I was going to do after school with one of my ‘projects’.\nAfter sitting down I noticed that we all had a blank sheet of white paper and a sharpened pencil in front of us and Mr Littlewood announced that today we would be doing ‘toe nail drawing’.\nAs I did not have a clue what it was my mind returned to my daydreaming and when I entered the reality zone again I noticed that everyone was busy scribbling away on their paper with the pencil provided.\nPanic set in so I turned to the pupil sat next to me to ask what I should be doing. It sadly was the class comic Peter Holmes who was an expert wind up merchant.\nMe: Pete what are we supposed to be doing ?\nPete: You know a tonal drawing\nNow I did not quite hear him correctly and thought he said just as the teacher had said ‘Toe Nail drawing’.\nMe: What is a Toe nail drawing?\nNow being a quick witted fellow Peter realized he was sat next to the class divbrain and could have some fun.\nPete: You know like a thumbnail sketch.\nMe: A what?\nPete: Yeah just draw a picture of a TOE NAIL that’s all you need to do.\nNow I should have suspected something as his arm came around to cover up the drawing he was doing and the guy sat the other side had twigged what was going on so did the same and I was left with no option but to try my best and draw a toe nail and hope Mr Littlewood was going to be pleased with my efforts.\nMr Littlewood announced after a while we should all finish up and he would come and inspect our work.\nEverything was fine until he reached my efforts. I could see that other pupils had drawn bowls of fruit so started to think I could have a problem.\nTeacher: What is this Morgan?\nMe: It is a toe nail sir\nTeacher: Why have you drawn a toe nail, Morgan?\nMe: Well sir you did say we had to make a toe nail sketch so that is what I did, you know it’s like a thumbnail sketch but lower down on one’s body, Sir.\nI somehow thought this snippet of artistic information might deflect what was looking like a seriously worsening situation.\nThe resulting apoplextic explosion was something to behold and everyone cowered in their seats. Somehow I was not physically assaulted as would have been the case with an older teacher but was just grabbed by the arm and propelled through the classroom door and out into the corridor and was told in no uncertain terms that making fun of a serious subject like art was not going to happen ever again and if it did I would be banned from art classes.\nWell that was another career crossed off my list on the trek through life as many others were later on.\nSadly the teacher Mr. Littlewood died during the Summer vacation that year at the age of 28 from an aortic aneurism and I often used to wonder if my stupidity had helped him on his way.",

They said that it had 3 eyes, but you couldn't see one of them. I thought it was really cool, but I was confused. The only things I had ever heard of that had 3 eyes were aliens, so naturally, I quietly raised my hand. When I was called on, I smiled, and confidently asked, “Wait, so if it has 3 eyes, is it an alien?” The people were a little surprised and a few of my classmates laughed. I hadn't mean it to be funny.

      "19": "In high school geometry I sat behind a girl whom I did not get along with. I had told my teacher before that we shouldn't be together so she knew there was a problem between us. Despite that, she did not change the seats around (maybe she thought we could work it out).\nAnyway, one day I'm sitting in class and I have my left leg up on my right knee. I am taller than average so I didn't have much leg room at my desk. Bear in mind this is similar to how my desk looked:\n(Not black, also wooden. Closest image I could find on Google Images)\nSo I had my leg up and I needed to move in my seat because I was becoming uncomfortable. When I tried to pull my leg off of my knee, I hadn't realized my foot had gotten caught in the hole of the desk in front of me and when I pulled down I accidentally kicked the girl in the lower back (it wasn't very hard).\nShe immediately gets up and starts yelling and cursing me out. She reports that I had kicked her in class on purpose because we had problems in the past. I tried to defend myself saying my foot got caught in the chair, but they really didn't take my word for it. The punishment was pretty severe too, they hit me with 10 days out-of-school suspension.\nIt gets even worse though. My parents tried to fight it because they thought the punishment was too severe. They told us I had to serve the 10 days because it was a violent offense but instead changed it to 3 days out-of-school (OSS) and 7 days in-school suspension (ISS).\nAt my particular school, having OSS meant being given a packet of extra work to get done while you were at home. ISS meant that you sit in a class with everyone else in ISS could not do anything other than assigned class work (probably about twice the normal amount for the period). If you finished early, they would phone the teacher to send down extra work. I couldn't even read a book if I wanted to. They even went as far as going to lunch when no one else was on lunch in fear of us seeing our friends or maybe not coming back to class. We were basically chaperoned the entire time.\nISS was the hell of high school.\nSo I guess while this isn't a ridiculous reason to get kicked out of class, it was a pretty ridiculous reason (getting my foot caught in a chair) to get kicked out of school (kinda) for 10 days.",

It was absolutely ridiculous.\nMy school had a highly outdated and sexist rule that was that the boys in the class would sit in the front and the girls in the back. I am dead serious about this, and this was a school in Yonkers, New York. I had transferred to the school in the middle of the year and I thought the girls would sit in the back on their own accord. However, when I sat in the front it was as if I had broken some sacred commandment and I was a slut for “wanting the boys’ attention by sitting next to them”. It made no sense and they were compromising the quality of my education by assuming that I was trying to get attention.\nI was so shocked when I first was told to get up because I would “distract” the guys. I refused to get up and then was kicked out of the class for this. After that day, I sat in the front every class and encouraged the other girls to do so too. Despite my efforts only three other girls supported me and tried to change things, one of whom was my sister and another was rarely ever in school.\nThe school threatened to suspend me and called my parents. Obviously my parents were on my side, and after my parents almost taking me out of the school I finally was allowed to sit in the front. They, then, divided the class into two sides with a division in the middle, the girls on the right and boys on the left. It’s still ridiculous to think that they were implementing such a sexist rule for such a long time.",
      "27": "In my first year in England I had an odd, Polish friend in primary school who would do interesting things like punching his jaws and making a face… repeatedly. One day we were reading books, and there was a pen nearby. Now, I couldn’t speak the language at the time and so I could never explain myself if I got into trouble. My friend was sitting next to me, and for some reason, he thought that - seeing the pen - it would be best to draw into the book. It was my book though, that he would want to scribble onto. But I didn’t want him to, and so I held his hand that he was trying to write with into the reading book. Unfortunately for me, the teacher only saw this part and concluded that I was at wrong for trying to force my friend to draw into my reading book. This was not the case, obviously.\nAnother time I would narrate my surroundings in Hungarian in the playground. And I was walking around a tree. Now, tree in my language is called “fa”. Many of them are “fák”, pronounced “fack”. Someone must have heard me say that because I was not allowed to participate in class. Infact, I was very new and was sent to a different class as punishment. The teacher there would ask me something every 5 mins. I always replied “I dont understand”, and she would not let me out. I suppose she wanted me to confess to my ‘crime’? But since I couldn’t speak the language, I could only say this and a few other words. The next day my father, with mediocre English barged into the class with me to explain my situation. I remember him bravely standing up for me, shouting at Miss Chandler, I was thinking that he must be saying : “he never even swears at home, let alone in a language that he doesn’t yet speak!”\nI hated my form/class teacher. There were many events like this, and I wanted to go back to Hungary - where I would be understood.\nEdit: Whoa that’s a lot of upvotes! Thanks everyone! :)\nEdit again: Christ!

      "28": "Got kicked out of class for crying over a 0% on a test.\nI was in 6th grade, Accelerated Reading and Writing.\nOur teacher, Mrs.M was a HUGE stickler for rules, and very set things.\nAs a 6th grader, I was terrified of anything under a B. Our school had a program where if you got all A’s (which was sadly rare in my school) they would send you to a FREE banquet luncheon, with amazing food, entertainment, and a goodie bag. (Also a couple hours off school. I never missed one from Kindergarten to 6th grade. Then I moved.)\nSo one day in class, she gave us a test, which, of course, was easy, as I had read the book the test was on 3 times. I even made my mother quiz me ten times the night before, and the morning of it.\nSo you can imagine my absolute horror when I got it back, and there was a big, fat, 0% right on the top, next to my name. I compared answers with the kid next to me who got a 100%, and I got every answer the same as me. I brought my test over to the teacher, and asked what I did wrong.\nYou know those tests that have the line next to the question number, where you’re supposed to write the answers? She gave me a 0% because I circled my answers instead of writing them on the line. That was all. That was it.\nShe had not told me I can only write them on the line. In fact, I barely knew what they were. Every class before me just let me circle the answers, I thought the lines were for the teacher to use. I broke down right at her desk, but I fought back my tears as I asked if there was any way I could retake it. She said no. She cruelly saw my face, already contorted with tears and the pain of holding them back, and said there was no way for me to retake it, as I now knew all the answers. No amount of showing her that I would have gotten them all right would persuade her, none of my classmates saying that she should let me retake it would persuade her. She made me sit back at my desk.\nI sat at my desk, and thought of having to skip the luncheon, the thought of my parents anger (I later found that they’re proud of me as long as I try hard, which greatly helped my stress), and the thought of the absolute ridiculousness of it all made me erupt in tears as she was talking. She yelled at me, and forced me out into the hallway, and locked it. I stayed in the hallway, sobbing, until the school officer found me and brought me to the nurse. The other english teacher yelled at her into letting me retake it, and I got to go to the luncheon.\nSorry for that long thing, but it still makes me angry. She left during our christmas break to help nurse her husband who just had a heart attack (absolutely lovely man, he was always so nice) and was replaced with a woman named Ms. Golden (real name, it was perfect) that helped me find my poetry and writing talent.\nTL;DR: Teacher kicked me out of class for giving me a 0% because of a rule she didn’t tell me, then got mad that I (the A’s all the way girl) started sobbing.",
      "29": "My daughter once got kicked out of class because of my stupid, politically-incorrect sense of humor. She was in fourth grade, I believe, and was learning about mental math (which means doing calculations in your head rather than on paper or with a calculator). I had made a joke at home about “mental” math, pretending to be mentally retarded as I said “one plus one is two” in a supposedly retarded voice. So the following day, in class, my daughter had a quiz for which she was supposed to use mental math. During the quiz, in what I was later told was a loud voice, she repeated my over-the-top depiction of a mentally-retarded person saying “one plus one is two.” My daughter earned a visit to the principal’s office and I earned a well-deserved lecture from my wife.",

I misunderstood what he meant by “look at” and thought we had to read the whole thing. In retrospect I do see that it would have been a completely unrealistic assignment, but I lived in a commune that was packed with professors and other academics. A few of them got really excited at the thought of helping me, and I'm a nerdy chick who loves puzzles. The result was that we planted ourselves around the kitchen table and spent most of the night translating that idiotic textbook.\nI admit that I felt like a fool when I realized that our teacher had only intended for us to glance at the book, but he was initially really impressed with my efforts. The problem only arose because I am physically unable to stay quiet when a classmate is struggling for an answer. Since I'd done about three months of homework in one night, I always had the answers. I know it's a crappy thing to do, but I kept whispering answers and writing them down on notes for whoever was being put on the spot.\nFinally our teacher had enough of me, and rightfully kicked me out of class. He overdid it by forbidding me to come back until the class was done with the book I'd accidentally read, so I had to sit outside the classroom door and read about poor Catulus until Christmas time.",

My barber always shaved my sideburns horizontally. This was the usual routine. Then in 6th grade, I had a different barber who cut my sideburns in a diagonal fashion. I didn't even notice. When I went to school the next day, my teacher saw my sideburns and freaked out. She assumed it was my way of showing my gang relations using my hair. Keep in mind I was 12. I told her that wasn't the case but she procedded to send me to the principal's office and called my parents. She made such a big fuss to the principal that I was very close to being suspended, had my parents not shown up and calmed down my teacher.

      "35": "This was in the third grade (US schools, age 8–9). That teacher, as I’ve mentioned in other answers, was a bit of a lunatic. I’ve mentioned before her fixation with the Challenger disaster (making us watch the video over and over, telling us that the astronauts died because God didn’t want women in space), her certainty that Libya was going to bomb the US into nuclear winter (told us that we were supposed to say goodbye to our parents every night instead of goodnight). That year was a really fun traipse through the poison flowerbed and I’ve talked about a lot of it here on Quora.\nI’m not sure I mentioned her deal with dead bodies in the woods.\nThe school playground comprised your usual eighties-era metal slides and jungle gyms, the sort of deathtraps that would make school officials clutch their chests in horror now. Past all of that, beyond the rutted dirt (no pea gravel or rubber mulch for us!) was a lovely meadow that extended toward a wooded area.\nKids were fascinated with the woods, and it was a constant battle for teachers to try to keep them out of there. It probably wasn’t school property, and who knows what a kid could get into. They could climb a tree and fall, their parents would sue, and then where would they be? Having grown up to be a somewhat responsible adult myself, I get it. We shouldn’t have been in the woods.\nMost teachers just yelled something to that effect or herded us away from danger. My teacher, however, took a slightly different approach. Instead of the lightbulb that appears over most heads when a great idea arrives, she had more of a popup timer that warned us that whatever insanity she’d been cooking up was ready to serve. She gathered us all in the audiovisual closet and disclosed, in hushed tones, that she had seen someone hiding bodies in the woods that morning. Kids’ bodies.\nI’d been on the receiving end of plenty of this woman’s nonsense and barely managed to turn a snort of laughter into a cough. It was worse than a bad ghost story, but here she was, goggling at us over her plastic bifocals, with her chins tucked down into the frilly collar of her blouse. I smirked, looking from her ridiculous expression to the kids, thinking, is this woman a heaping bucket of batshit, or what?\nTo my surprise, my classmates’ faces were slack with horror. Girls had their hands over their mouths. Boys looked at one another with wide eyes. As the teacher went on with her story about how she’d heard that someone murders kids and hides their bodies in the woods, they eagerly lapped it up. She’d always thought it was a story, but she saw it for herself when she pulled in to the teacher’s parking lot.\nI was disgusted with my classmates. I looked out the window.\nI must not have been the only disbeliever, because she upped her game. A few days later, she brought us all to the edge of the woods in a line. Two large rectangles had been dug in the dirt, about six inches deep. A shovel was tossed to one side. Look! Graves!\nFaced with such incontrovertible evidence, one girl started crying and fled back to the swingset.\nThis nonsense went on for quite a while. Finally a girl, the one who had lost her mind when she saw the shallow graves, came up to me and asked why I didn’t believe the teacher about the dead kids buried in the woods.\nThere was no love lost between me and this lady. I spoke loudly. “Because it is beyond stupid. It is BEYOND STUPID and if you are going to believe that you should also CALL THE POLICE because she witnessed a MURDER and did NOTHING.” Then I stared her down.\nThe next thing I knew, the claw had descended on my shoulder and steered me out of the room into the Audiovisual Closet. The door locked behind me. I was an old hand at this punishment; she and I weren’t friends. I took up my old spot by the window as I listened to the echo of her voice on the other side of the cinderblock wall. In twenty minutes or so, the door opened.\n“You dug the holes.” I said. “And they weren’t even deep.”\nThe door closed and locked again.\nIt was beyond stupid, and I will stand by that.\nIncidentally, I broke off a row of pencils in a gap in the wall while I waited to be set free. I drove the pencil into the gap as far as it would go, snapped it off at the base, and then did it again. I had the gap almost completely full when they let me out. I wonder who ended up finding them, and how many years it took for them to notice.",
      "36": "My father died.\nWell, not exactly. I mean, he did die, but that's not why I was kicked out of class. It was due to unfinished assignments that accumulated for a couple weeks after his death.\nMy sixth grade teacher insisted that we journal each day and would provide question prompts that we had to write about. The prompts were all painfully childish and I was hitting a point where I wanted to distance myself from kid stuff. Add to that the fact that my father was diagnosed with cancer only a few weeks into the school year and you could imagine why it was hard to write a journal entry on “What would I do if I had a flying school bus?” or “If I were a jungle animal, which one would I be?”\nA month and a half into the school year my dad died and I took some time off from school. When I came back I remembered that the other students very mechanically expressed their condolences, but it felt like they were keeping their distance. In hindsight I realize that they were processing the fact that one of their parents could die too and that can be hard to process in 11 year old brains. The teacher was nice for the first few days, but once that grace period was up she fell on me like a ton of bricks.\nThe journal entries had started to pile up. I hated journaling. I hated those prompts. I hated writing. I would write the question prompt on the top of the page and just stare at it for the next half hour. That went on for a couple weeks until one day when Mrs. M asked to see my journal, saw that I hadn’t written anything, snatched it from me and escorted me to the principal’s office. I was given one day of in-school suspension, sitting in a corner of the nurse’s office, and would continue to be suspended until all of my journal assignments were finished.\nI don’t remember anything that I angrily scrawled in the journal, but I will never forget all the kids that came into the nurse’s office with projectile vomiting. Evidently, I timed my punishment to coincide with the peak of a stomach virus that was going around.\nI distinctly remember some of my classmates asking our teacher why she was being so tough on me. I found out quite a bit later that the school counselor had sort of a tough love attitude and advised my teacher that in order for things to get back to normal, she needed to make it clear that my grieving couldn’t be used as an excuse for anything. Shockingly, things never got back to normal.\nI hated writing ever since. The first time I attempted college I could never get past the basic college writing class everyone has to take. I did great in my math and science classes, but writing always felt too… violating. Now that I’ve finished my undergraduate degree I’ve made a concerted effort to get better at subjects I had a hard time with. I have a renewed passion for visual arts, music, and literature; but any type of writing is still pretty painful. The great thing about Quora is that I don’t have to write about something if I don’t want to.",

At some point I started wondering about some formula we had to use. We just had to apply it, and it was one of those our teacher said we should just take as fact, without trying to understand it.\nAt this point, I was staring out the window, thinking if I could relate this to something I had just learned in physics. The teacher came by and asked how I was doing. I quietly said I was fine, wanting to solve my current problem by myself. He looked irritated, and pointed at my book. “Oh really?

My high school had a lot of students of Italian Heritage, and most of the staff could understand, if not outright speak, Italian (or many of its dialects).\nOne day, I was in History Class (Grade 10) and the teacher (Let’s call him B) was talking about World War II. Mr. B was a great teacher, don’t get me wrong. He always found a way to keep his students interested with the subject, and had, for each of us, a different approach. He knew our interests, and cared for us as individuals before students. He was also a really funny guy. When talking about World War II, especially Italy, Mr. B would get really patriotic (to put into perspective, on March 17, which is the date in which Italy was proclaimed as a country, he came draped in an Italian flag).\nOn this particular day, we were discussing Operation Husky\n, which was the landing of Allied forces in Sicily. So, at the beginning of the period, to give us an idea of the geography, started explaining where Sicily was, but he pointed at the other major Italian island, Sardinia. Basically, he swapped the two of them and no one noticed. I didn’t immediately process what he said, but, after I couple of minutes I put my hand up and I said something along the line of “Sir, I think you swapped the two islands.”. For some reason, instead of admitting his mistake, which he never had a problem with before, he went berzerk on me. I was sent to the VP’s office, but the secretary, upon hearing why I was there, called the teacher down and basically forced him to apologize. Still, I couldn’t go back to class, and from that day til the end of the semester, neither Island was ever talked about.",

He used to stand in the four-hall ( a hallway with four intersecting pathways) and scream at us to “GET TO YOUR CLASSES, RIGHT NOW!”\nHe was horribly abusive, and loved to goad students into being ‘disrespectful’ in retaliation, so he could give them detention, or suspension. If we did get in trouble, in class, our teachers would just send us to the library, or the bathroom, to wait out the period.\nOne morning, Mr. Bean brought his 9 year old son to work, because his son had an appointment later that morning, and Mr. Bean wanted to save time. Big mistake. Huge.\nMr. Bean sent his son outside to play on the public playground (located near the school), until it was time to leave. Apparently, a couple of 14 year old boys were out there, smoking, and after finding out who’s kid he was, beat him nearly to death.\nAs the ambulance was pulling up, Mr. Bean was walking back and forth in front of the crowd of teachers and students, standing outside. He was studying all of our faces, and he saw me. I was crying, because I knew his son. He rode the same church bus I did, and I thought he was a nice kid.\nI have no idea why Mr. Bean thought I was crying, but he called me a ‘vicious bitch’, and told me I was suspended for ten days.

For those who don’t know what it is, it’s a teacher-based website that allows classes to communicate outsdie of the classroom. I highly reccomend you check it out.\nAnyways, my class was not very good with using Edmodo, so I decided to make a group run by students that the whole student body could join. There was one for each subject and I was really hopeful for how it would go. I distributed the codes publicly, as I had nothing to hide. What’s wrong with an innocent study group, right?\nHowever, one student said this or something along the lines of it on the Science group: “Has anybody taken the test yet? Can somebody please tell me what’s on it?” While it wasn’t exactly cheating and nobody answered, it was on the verge of it. Administration who had been monitoring this group for a while, pulled me out of class within the next few days.\nAt first, I wasn’t sure what it was about. The principal sat me down (let’s call him Mr. D). I was afraid I was in trouble but I wasn’t sure. He showed me the Edmodo group and I admitted to everything. Honestly, it was frightining then, but looking back, it really had not nothing to worry about.\nI found out I had broken the policy as I wasn’t 18+ but I wasn’t in any major trouble. I was unaware of the post that had been made and I was simply a smart child who was trying to find a creative way to study.

For helping someone sort out their chair, last art lesson this girls chair was wonky and my friend knew how to fix it so she did, our teacher lost it and sent her out for the whole lesson.\nI have many more but these are the most recent",
      "45": "Not me personally but my friend.\nWe all went to a fee paying girls' school in the UK , hence subject choices for post 16 education were a bit limited but class sizes ranged from 4-12 pupils so we got a good education.\nMy friend chose history for one of her subjects and was taught this by the head teacher. Eventually we started selecting universities to apply to for a place the year after we left school. One day my friend came in and said that she would not apply for uni as she'd decided to follow in her father's footsteps and become a physiotherapist and would go directly to a training hospital. She was just about to apply to her father's alma mater.\nThe head went ballistic and banned her from her sight, including history lessons. This ban lasted 3 weeks.\nNo attempt was made to persuade her to go to uni, then train. The head clearly had no idea that she was failing to provide the tuition for which the parents were paying! Just pure bad temper from the head who was supposed to set us all an example.\nBefore anybody asks I have no idea how my friend's parents reacted.",
      "46": "My homework.\nI am horrible at art, so when I handed in my homework, I then had the flu for a week.\nI returned after a week, and in art, my teacher pulled me aside.\n“Aaron, what is this?”\nMe, in my 11 year old innocence. “My art homework Miss, is it not satisfactory?”\nHer, now angered. “So, you are saying that this is satisfactory?” She rips it up. “You should be in Special Needs for your drawing capability. “\nI stood shocked, my class stood shocked. I stuttered.\n“See! You can’t even speak correctly.”\nNow I was angry, I was really, really angry. “So you are saying my entire intellectual capability should be completely ignored due to my lack of artistic skills?!”\nShe nods.\nI shout. “If you can insult me, then fine, see what my mother has to say to the fact her child should be sent from Upper Band to Lower Band due to the skill of which he draws.”\nI stormed out.",
      "47": "Ooh I got a story.\nBack in 9th grade, near the end of the school year we had nothing to do the last week of school, only doing makeup work.\nAnyway, there were a few kids making up tests, while my group of friends were in a circle talking to each other.\nSo the teacher came over and said….\n“I'm gonna need you guys to break up the circle.”\nTo which I replied …\n“Quick! Make a square!”\nSoon followed by….\n“Triangle!”\n“Rhombus!”\n“Straight Line!”\nSafe to say the teacher didn't appreciate the geometry lesson. Oh well!",
      "48": "I got kicked out of class because of a FART!\nIt was very noisy at the class. Everybody was yelling, shouting and talking. Friend that was sitting next to me farted few times loud! No one cared it because of the noise!\nThen I said. ‘’ I can feel it coming, it is going to be enormous’’. AND IT WAS!\nBut a second before I farted, while glitching and pushing strong, a teacher yelled ‘’ QUIET’’. And of course everybody went quiet, and I farted hard, loud, AND ENORMOUSLY.\nThat's why she kicked me out of class!\nThat’s ridiculous and sort of funny now!",
      "49": "I was kicked out of my class twice: on both occasions by the same professor. No other student was thrown out in those 2 years. I have so many such incidents to narrate as a student but I would be sharing only 2 in this answer.\nIncident 1:\nThe guy used to take Entrepreneurship course in my second semester of MBA (yes the curriculum had a theoretical course of Entrepreneurship). The only reason why I attended some of his classes was because of the 75% mandatory attendance in each course.\nI decided to read Soccernomics\nand completed almost half the book attending 3 of his classes. I ran out of my luck in the fourth class. Wait !!! I was not thrown out because I was reading the book. There’s a bizarre/ridiculous/irrational reason which convinced him to throw me out of the class.\nI was sitting in the penultimate row in the middle (3 students per bench). My bench mates decided to ruin my day and they started some unwarranted debate something like who’s better? Messi or Ronaldo? What followed resembled a Gulf war where the benches next to our bench also got involved in this useless debate.\nThe ensuing commotion attracted the attention of the professor (who just needs a simple reason to complete the session without actually teaching anything).\nProf for Professor, L for the guy sitting on my left, R for the guy sitting on my right\nProf: Hey, you? Stand up\nL stood up (the one who started this whole mess)\nProf: Not you, the other one\neveryone including R thought that the prof was asking him to stand up\nR stood up\nMe: why is this guy punishing R for the mess created by L?\nProf: Not you, the one in the centre.\nMe: (with a puzzled look on my face) me? what did I do?\nProf: Get out of my class, no arguments\nI tried explaining my case, but he was not in a mood that day to listen at least a single word from me.\nI hated that guy so much so that I never took any of his courses in the following semester.\nIncident 2:\nI have one more incident to share; it is not exactly about me being kicked out of the class, but something on the similar lines.\nThere was this visiting professor who has a rule which I guess he will follow till the day he quits teaching.\n“No one can enter my class after me”\nAnd the worse part is the academics team used to schedule this Prof’s class in the morning. I have sacrificed my breakfasts/sleep on multiple occasions because of this stupidity of my college acads team.\nOne day I was frantically waiting for the lift to arrive (with what if the prof has already reached the class before me fear back in my mind). The lift finally arrived and much to my relief I found the Prof walking towards the lift taking one step at a time (He used to teach Operations Management). I held the lift door for him assuming that this act of mine will get my some brownie points. He didn’t even smile after entering the lift. After an awkward 30 secs of my life the lift door opened and out of respect for the prof I let him leave the lift first.\nThe prof entered the class and much to my surprise shut the door right on my face. I stood there baffled at the mean behavior of my prof whom I helped only a couple of minutes ago.",
      "50": "My teacher misplaced my notebook. The previous lesson we were told to hand in our notebooks for marking, I was a bit of a nerd and always did as I was told, so I handed in my book.\nThe next lesson she claims to not have my book, doesn't even attempt to look for it to see if it may have been muddled with another one of her classes just straight out accuses me of lying. Now a couple of weeks ago another student in the class was in a similar situation, (he was one of the trouble makers) and her response was to give him a new notebook.\nI had never been in trouble before, as a result I began to cry. As I was crying most of the class began to yell at the teacher for telling me of (extremely sweet of them, I was a nerd with friends), the teacher's response was to kick me out of the class, although it didn't help much as she was still yelled at for the rest of the lesson.\nIronically the next lesson she was extremely sweet to me."

    "title": "Who removed the book of Enoch in the Bible and why",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Good day. I guess it only surfaced at a later stage, after king James compiled the known bible. I read it and as a Christian, saw nothing wrong with it but, the book I actually enjoyed was the book of Jasher because, it gives more detail about what happened.",
      "2": "The book of Enoch is part of the Tewahedo canon and was accepted by the Dead Sea Scrolls sect. In fact the Qumran scrolls contain more copies of Enoch than they do of Genesis. The book of Enoch was also well known to New Testament authors, since it's quoted in three places.",
      "3": "The Book of Enoch is not included in most mainstream versions of the Bible, such as the Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox canons. The reasons for its exclusion are complex and debated among scholars, but there is no one definitive answer.\nOne possible explanation is that the Book of Enoch was not considered canonical, meaning it was not seen as authoritative or inspired by God. While some early Christian writers, such as Tertullian and Origen, referenced the book and saw it as useful for teaching, it was not universally accepted by the early church. The book was also not included in the Jewish canon of scripture.\nAnother possible explanation is that the Book of Enoch contained ideas and themes that were seen as controversial or heretical by some early Christian leaders. For example, the book describes a group of fallen angels called the Watchers who come to earth, mate with human women, and produce a race of giants. This idea was seen as too fantastical or too pagan by some early Christian leaders, who rejected the book as unreliable or misleading.\nIt's also worth noting that the process of canonization, or the determination of which books were included in the Bible, was a gradual and complex process that took centuries. The books that are included in the Bible today were selected based on a variety of factors, including their historical and theological importance, their widespread acceptance among the faithful, and their consistency with the teachings of the church.",
      "4": "Enoch never was in the Bible,\nAnd you could just as easily say the Apocrypha was taken out of the Bible just because. Brilliant texts such as the Shepherd of Hermes or all the letters of Clement of Alexandria also were never in the Bible, and do they have a right to be in there? You bet your life they most certainly do. And the gentle writer mourns about Enoch, an assuredly unimportant text.\nThese children really need to do their homework before spouting off.",
      "5": "The Rabbi council of Laodicea, 5th century AD",
      "6": "The short answer is, no one did, because it never was an accepted part of the Biblical canon, at least by the vast majority of Jewish and Christian believers. While it’s clear that it was known (and even quoted) by the New Testament authors and the early Church, there was never any consensus that it should be assigned the authority of true Scripture. For one thing, its authorship has traditionally been ascribed to Enoch, grandfather of Noah, but it only dates from around 200–300 BC. Neither internal claims nor external attestation suggest that it was written under God’s inspiration, and it was never really much considered for inclusion in the Biblical canon by the vast majority of the Church.",
      "7": "It was a choice between the book of Revelation and the book of Enoch. Revelation was chosen.",
      "8": "Enoch was written and became popular among Jews long before Jesus. The only way for it to have ever been in the Bible was through the Hebrew Scriptures.\nThere is no indication at all that Jewish scholars ever added Enoch to their canon. In fact, there is no indication that Enoch slipped into the Greek translation of the Jewish Scriptures, the Septuagint, as other books did.\nIt wasn’t removed because it wasn’t added in the first place.",
      "9": "My understanding is that it all was done at the Nicaean Council, under the auspices of the Universal {Catholic} Roman Church.",
      "10": "Thanks for asking me this question. Please read Steve Hawkin’s answer. I completely concur with it and could not write anything better.",
      "11": "This question assumes that it was once part of the canon of scripture and was later taken out. That is not the case. Most Christians have never considered Enoch to be part of the Bible.",
      "12": "This is a joke question, right?\nYou are assuming the book of enoch was part of the Bible in the first place!\nIt was NEVER considered Scripture.\nThe catholic cult ADDED it.",
      "13": "Nobody, it was never supposed to be there to begin with; neither Christianity nor Judaism recognizes it as such.",
      "14": "God. (1 Cor. 12:10)",
      "15": "The Book of Enoch was not actually removed from the bible. It was never accepted an canon by Christians.",

      "18": "those who chose what should be included in the bible. it was excluded because the book of Enoch is a fake created by someone pretending to be Enoch to give him self credibility but used fables mixed with truth to appear credible but contradicts the bible and is therefore a fake. not inspired by god.",
      "19": "The book of Enoch was not removed from the Bible. The book of Enoch was never in the Bible. There is no evidence that the book of Enoch was ever in the Bible."

The second step is to wait until he goes to work and wait about 30 minutes to nake sure he doesnt come back. Niw that you are sure pack as much as you can and leave. Dont tell him where or why or when. Just go. Of you have kids then pick them up early from school.\nStep 3 is to seek help from family, lawyers and maybe even the law depending on how bad he gets.\nThere is no excuse for assault.

He frequently checked both accounts so even if she could save some of the very small amount he gave her he would know\nShe took care of the household accounts like groceries and utilities. One time she accidentally over paid the gas bill. The next month she got the bill. It had a section with the current amount used with a credit for the overpayment.\nShe started overpaying a little on all utilities and after a year she had saved up quite a few dollars.\nNext she cashed in her overpayments and talked to a lawyer. She had enough to rent a small apartment and divorced his ass taking half of everything he had.\nThis isn't a quick fix and if you are getting hit a lot I would recommend leaving first.

Date the picture and share a copy with a relative or friend. Try to secretly record any threatening conversation he has with you over the phone and share that with a friend.

Everyone in the world would see who he his.\nAnd if you are asking what if he is not with his phone. Not to worry, if you have any video or audio file that also confirms he has hit you.

The very first true opportunity, I had my boss at the time lived in an area that was very wooded, and her mother allowed me to come stay with them. He went to a Mardi Gras parade.

I am not saying this will sort the problem what it will do is show the man that you are not a weak, obedient girl/woman. For some men are like beasts if they see that they have “won\" in this way they will do it again and again to get what they want and usually they will do it for everything.

      "13": "It is very hard to surround China with naval forces, since while China has an extensive coastline, it also has land borders with many other countries.\nThe question of militarily forcing China to do anything is nearly absurd. China is an extremely capable military force. The Chinese Navy is actually larger than the American Navy, second to us in aircraft carriers, but with equal or greater forces of most other classes of ships.",
      "14": "This is exactly what the United States has done for a long time.\nBut now the encirclement of the United States has been broken. Not only is the first island chain useless, but even the soldiers stationed there have become hostages. The number of land-based hypersonic missiles manufactured by China is very large, and it is difficult for human beings to intercept them at this stage (China itself cannot intercept them). Therefore, the Western Pacific is no longer a safe strategic rear and supply base for the US military.\nBrand new frigate destroyers with vertical launch missiles are already common in the Chinese Navy and are still expanding this force at a breakneck pace, they are even sailing in Alaska. China's third electromagnetic catapult aircraft carrier, Fujian, has been launched and has hundreds of stealth fighters and unmanned wingmen. China also has a large number of large unmanned combat aircraft (not toys on the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield), some of which even have stealth capabilities. In the future, the aerospace aircraft being developed by China can realize low-Earth orbit cruise and global strike missions, and it will completely replace stealth bombers.\nI think that future wars will become a competition of national industrial capabilities, and whoever can produce a large number of missiles and shells in a short period of time will be able to take the initiative on the battlefield. The anxious state of the Russian-Ukrainian battlefield is nothing more than that neither side can manufacture cheap and large-scale war consumables, nor does it have efficient investigation and logistics capabilities. Once one of the parties changes this situation, the casualties of soldiers on the front line will drop significantly, and the other party will not be far from collapse.\nYes, China is aggressively protesting the U.S. Navy coming across the Pacific on its doorstep.

Some threat.\nIf no country in the region tries to oppress or coerce others then the US forces poses no harm to anyone and in any case it is just helping to keep the trade shipping lanes open.\nWhy does China see that as a threat?\nIt is rich that the actual aggressors complain that they are NOT allowed to bully their neighbors because the USN gets in the way.\nJapan felt the same way in 1941 and after the USN was removed from the region the whole region was attacked and conquered.\nAgain the USN is there to maintain international law and to keep the peace that it has done successfully since WW2.",

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), as one of the US government's main \"foot soldiers\", \"white gloves\" and \"democracy crusaders\", has subverted lawful governments and cultivated pro-US puppet forces around the world under the pretext of promoting democracy. Its disgraceful record has aroused strong discontent in the international community. In today's world, peace and development is the theme of the times, and the trend towards greater democracy in international relations is unstoppable. Any attempt to interfere in other countries' internal affairs in the name of democracy is unpopular and is doomed to failure. I. NED organizational structure After World War II, the United States opened a covert front against the Soviet Union through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other intelligence apparatus. By the 1960s, the United States had realized gradually that it was far from enough to \"promote democracy\" through secret means only. There was an urgent need to establish a \"public-private mechanism\" to openly provide funding. In 1983 and with the efforts of the then US President and some other people, NED was founded as a bipartisan, non-profit institution. NED is nominally an NGO that provides support for democracy abroad, but in fact, it relies on continuous financial support from the White House and the US Congress, and takes orders from the US government. Through the provision of funding, it has manipulated and directed NGOs around the world to export American values, conduct subversion, infiltration and sabotage, and incite so-called \"democratic movements\" in target countries and regions. It is essentially the US government's \"white glove\" that serves US strategic interests. As early as in 1991, the founder of NED Alan Weinstein put it bluntly in an interview with the Washington Post that a lot of what they were doing was what the CIA had done 25 years ago. NED was therefore known globally as the \"second CIA\". NED has four core institutes: the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, mainly responsible for supporting local political groups; the American Center for International Labor Solidarity responsible for promoting trade unions and labor movements; and the Center for International Private Enterprise for co-opting private enterprises. Through these four institutes, NED has become the mastermind behind separatist riots, color revolutions, political crises, lies and rumors, and infiltration around the world, with an ever-growing list of evils. II. Instigating color revolutions to subvert state power NED was seen behind color revolutions instigated and orchestrated by the United States, including the disin\nhttps://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202205/08/WS6277847fa310fd2b29e5b4c2.html\nI even doubt if the democrats founded the massive roits in 2020 for election purpose, because some hongkongese sponsored by NED participated in the roit too.",
      "17": "In China, political correctness should refer to CCP’s political correctness. Some negative comments on CCP would not be allowed.\nFew years ago, some people tried to make up fake news on CCP and fraud Chinese. Then CCP starts to restrict comments on politics. And now it becomes overcorrecting.",
      "18": "Well, consider in general, China is a very conservative nation, I would suggest you ask Yes or No at first before you ask why.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "As far as freight rail is concerned, the answer is no. This comes down to the spec for how high a car and its associated equipment must be above the rails: four inches.\nAir hoses used in the trains braking system are the most common offenders for low hanging devices on trains. Four inches might be the spec, but it's common for them to hang lower so long as they're not dragging. Being less than four inches tall when laying down would be rare for an adult. Then taking into account that many hang lower still means you would not be having a good time. Those connectors are over a pound of solid steel: imagine getting hit by a blunt object traveling at 20, 30, or even 40mph up to ninety or a hundred times if it's a long train: I don't think you would make it. That's the best case scenario.\nIf you're unlucky, the train consist has one of these: a hopper car. Just look how low those can get to the rails! At least your end will be quick when those 150 or so tons squish you out of existence.\nDon't ever play around trains nor tracks. You're not clever, you're not going to be okay, and whatever bad thing you can imagine will happen, will happen. The sheer size of these things make them unforgiving; they don't stop very quickly, and all that weight behind them will make short work of you. Almost everyone I know working on the railroad has been involved in a fatality. Those killed thought they could beat the train; they couldn't. You can't, and you never will.\nThe good news is, rail safety is very easy. You can control just about everything when it comes to your safety. Stay away from the tracks, and when crossing, always assume a train can come from any direction at anytime!",
      "2": "I knew a guy that would do this in the late 80s to impress girls. I was never there when he did it but heard about it later. It was all over the news. Apparently he did it several times and was just fine until one day a passenger train went over him. Unlike a freight train, passenger trains have a gangway connection between the cars. Looks like an accordion.\nFrom what I understand this creates suction as the train passes over. After the train was gone, no one could find him. I won’t go into the graphic nature of what little they did find. So yes, it is possible to survive a train passing over you under very specific circumstances. Not something I’d be willing to bet my life on though.",
      "3": "No, you’ll die.\nModern trains have a lot of stuff underneath them. Besides all the boxes of electrical equipment there are compressors, air tanks, traction motors, etc. But the most dangerous to you would be two classes of things:\nReceivers for track-mounted beacons\nDeflectors\nThe most common type of receiver here in the UK would be the AWS/TPWS receiver.\nThe manufacturer recommends these are mounted 165–185mm above rail level, so if any part of you stuck up higher than that then you’ll get snagged and then rolled up into an unpleasant ball of broken bones and misery. People that get bundled up underneath trains don’t die straight away, but they do die.\nDeflectors are designed to protect the train by preventing anything going under it. They will deflect animals or people just as much as they will shopping trolleys, bicycles and breeze blocks. The deflector is the chunky object the width of the tracks below the coupler on the train below. You do not want this hitting you:\nWhere you can potentially lie down and survive is in the gap between two sets of lines (the “six foot”).\nThis is an emergency procedure taught to all rail workers in case they can’t make it to a position of better safety, but it’s considered risky and that’s only with the train passing by next to you. If you lie down between the running rails (the “four foot”) you’re not likely to survive.",
      "4": "I had a friend that used to hop trains back when we were teens. He missed once and lost half his foot as it was run over. Fast forward 20 years and he is drinking and winds up laying down on the tracks and passes out. He woke up with a train passing over him. Unfortunately he didn’t stay still and was struck by an axle. The injury was not immediately fatal but he did pass later in the hospital from it. There’s a reason they tell us to stay away from the train tracks so much when we are little.",
      "5": "The short answer is yes. It obviously depends on the country you live in and what kinds of train and track you are talking about but I know it can be done because I knew people who did it.\nI grew up living a couple of hundred yards from a fright line in Scotland. Trains passed about every half hour and there were no high-speed trains or passenger trains. Mostly coal trains and flat cars carrying trucks and vans. We played on the railway all the time. There was effectively no fence on our side, not that it would have stopped us, and we did some stupid stuff but while I lived there no one was killed or injured. Which looking back was a minor miracle.\nStandard practice was throwing rocks at the trains. They were diesel so you could hear them coming a mile away, even from inside your house. Very occasionally saw a steam engine. When you heard a train coming you’d charge from wherever you were to the waste ground next to the line and pound the train with rocks. It was like the pied piper as all the other kids did the same thing, usually all heading back to what you were doing before once the train had passed. One occasion, as the end of the train passed we saw two little kids sitting on the back of the train! Casual as can be, they must’ve been about seven years old. No idea where they got on or where they planned to get off. We must have done thousands of pounds of damage to the trucks and vans on the trains but when you’re ten you don’t think that way. You’re just playing and the world is your playground.\nMost of the engines looked like this or were similar but with a ‘nose’ sticking out the front.\nAnother game was to take a rail each and bum your way backwards along the rail placing ballast stones on top of it until a train came. When close to the track you could hear trains miles away as the track made a pinging, tinging sound. Then you ran off the track and watched as the train shattered and spat stones in all directions! It was quite impressive.\nThere were close calls. One problem was that, while you could hear the trains a long way off, if one train was passing you couldn’t hear another coming the other way. Saw a couple of near misses caused by that. The railway police did try to catch us. Every now and then they’d send a special train out, just for us. You know the thing about a train taking miles to stop? Not if it’s just an engine and a guard’s van it doesn’t. We’d all be standing there, rocks at the ready, and this tiny train stopped dead in front of you. Out jumps half a dozen railway cops who proceeded to try and catch us. Never caught anyone, fat middle aged men against ten year olds, no chance. But hat’s off, they gave it a go.\nGuard’s van.\nMy cousin played chicken. He and his pals stood on the track as a train came and first one to jump clear was the chicken. I never saw it personally and wouldn’t have done it.\nBut to the original question. A girl who stayed just round the corner, about six doors away, lay under a train. The group she was hanging around with decided this should be a dare and they all had to do it. I wasn’t there, I didn’t see it but I know it happened. I was talking to her later and said “Are you out of your mind? You could’ve been killed.” She just shrugged and said “It was a dare, you had to do it.” As far as I am aware they all did it and all survived. Crazy.\nThis is the line that passed my house taken after it was reinstated and electrified. Notice there is still little fencing on the left side. To the left, behind the camera on the other side of the bridge is a long patch of waste ground. I lived across the park from that. This looks pretty much exactly as it did forty five years ago except for the overhead lines and no big holes in the fence.\nThe biggest fright I personally got was one day when three of us had dug a hole under the track, into the small embankment. One of the guys was always in trouble with the law and school and he was talking about being in trouble for smoking. Just at this point a guy drove onto the waste ground, to dump rubbish as everyone did, and got out of his car. Gary yelled “There’s a greaser” and dived into the hole. I don’t know why but I thought he was talking about this guy in the car and ‘greaser’ was his nickname for someone who could get you in trouble for smoking. I didn’t smoke so I just sat where I was, on top of the banking about a foot from the track. I casually said to Gary “Is that guy a greaser?”. He pointed over my shoulder and yelled “That is a greaser!” You think trains look big from the side? You want to try seeing one coming towards you from about twenty feet away when your head is two foot off the ground and you’re sitting almost on the track! It’s like a massive yellow and blue monster that’s about to kill you. I doubt I’ve ever moved so fast. I leapt over what was left of the fence and sprinted clear. I turned and stood in shock, heart pounding in my chest while my two pals were already out of the hole and merrily bouncing rocks off the train from literally five feet away. To this day I have no idea why I didn’t hear it coming, or why the driver didn’t sound the horn as they usually did.\nI lived next to that line for fifteen years and no one was hurt or killed on it. Shortly after that it was taken out of service and the track lifted. The line has now been reinstated as part of a new passenger line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, it has proper fencing and quicker trains. Kids these days don’t seem to do the wild things we took for granted. You don’t see them out playing, they seem to stay in the house all the time. I think that’s sad. Yes, the stuff we did was dangerous, destructive, illegal and stupid but you know what? At the time, it was brilliant.",
      "6": "Lots of good answers here, so I will only add one important consideration that hasn’t been covered.\nWhen I was about eight, I loved to be around trains. I would climb in, on, and around them — and occasionally under them. During one of these outings, when I was underneath a train, the train began to slowly move. The axle passed easily over the length of my body, but it barely made it over my head even though I turned my face to one side. It was a very tight fit. As soon as the train stopped, I scrambled out from under it as quickly as I could.\nI can easily imagine that, at a higher speed, it would be very likely to receive a serious or fatal head injury from a low axle if one is not perfectly oriented and holding perfectly still against the ground. And I was just an average-sized kid…but what about an overweight adult? I’m sure it would depend upon the type of train, axle-height, and presence of other protrusions underneath the train car…but I wouldn’t risk it.",
      "7": "The engines on NZ trains used to have cowcatchers like this on the front, Note the small foot platform and white handle for shunting staff to ride there and hop off quickly to change the points.\nWe were also told if caught in a tunnel to lie flat against the wall. There’s a small area that no projections from the train pass over.",
      "8": "It would depend on the train, how big you are, what you’re wearing and various other factors. So it is possible, but it’s risky.\nAlso it will generally not work on trams and metro trains as they don’t have as much clearance underneath. In the Stockholm metro there is a space built into the platform for you to go into.\nNot a lot of space under them.",

      "10": "Depends on the train.\nIn the NYC subway someone did it. There was a guy who went into a seizure and fell on the tracks. Another guy saw him and jumped on top of him to keep him down. They both survived and it was witnessed by a lot of people. His name was Wesley Autry and he was called the Subway Samaritan. Here he is on Letterman.\nBut I wouldn’t recommend trying it.\nEDIT - I screwed up. I did NOT want to put up that Opie and Anthony clip. I remember watching that guy on Letterman and he was so humble and matter of fact he showed what a real hero was - just a regular guy. He was later at the State of the Union.\nSorry for the clip - it was a mistake and pisses me off that those two would have belittled that guy in any way at all. And thanks to those who pointed it out!",

      "12": "No. Trains these days sit quite low on the tracks, and with the various bits and pieces underneath, you’d be hit by the train.\nNot much space under these. This type of train (a Class 158) is actually quite old and is probably higher off the ground than the newer rolling stock.\nIt’s worth noting, however, that lying down in the space between the sets of tracks is more likely to succeed; indeed, this is taught in the UK to trackside workers as a last-last-last-ditch attempt to avoid being hit by a train. I sincerely hope no one ever has to put this to the test!",
      "13": ".\nThere are two very long steel things that the train tends to ride on…the RAILS.\nKeep in mind that as long as you are not in between these two steel rals and are standing far enough away from them…then the train can not hit you as long as it remains on the rails.\nDon’t play silly games or laying on the tracks.\nDon;t play silly games of standing too close to a moving train.\nI have helped the Police retrieve pieces of bodies after a train has run over them.\nWe picked up various pieces strewn and dragged along about a half mile of track.\nI once found an identifiable piece (after the main chewed up body mass was removed).\nIt was a big toe still attached to what remained of most of foot skinned.\nThere was not much left of the body that was identifiable.\nBetween the rails was viscera stretched for about a 1/4 mile. Intestines, skin, veins, a stretched muscle.\nAll stuck to the spikes between the rails.\nThe body did not just get passed over by the train.\nTwo bodies a couple months apart.\nRival gangs in the neighborhood.",
      "14": "Well there have been cases reported where people had no injury when the train passed over them. We can say such people are lucky enough. Though there is a gap between a person laying on the rail track and the train passing above but still the risk is very high and can lead to severe injuries or even death.\nIt is not safe or recommended to lay down on train tracks to try and survive a train passing over you. Trains are extremely heavy and powerful, and they can easily cause serious injury or death if you are on the tracks when they pass by.\nEven if you are able to lay flat enough to avoid being hit directly by the train, there are other dangers to consider. Trains can create strong gusts of wind that can throw objects and debris, including your own clothing, into the air. In addition, the undercarriage of a train can have protruding parts and debris that could still cause serious injury if you are laying on the tracks.\nFurthermore, it can be difficult to accurately judge the speed and distance of an oncoming train, especially if it is approaching from a curve or in low visibility conditions. Even experienced train conductors can have difficulty stopping a train in time to avoid hitting someone on the tracks.\nIn short, attempting to survive a train by laying down on the tracks is an extremely dangerous and ill-advised idea. If you find yourself in a situation where you are too close to a train, it is much safer to move away from the tracks and seek shelter or help if possible.",
      "15": "No.\nUnlike some here I actually have taken Railroad Protection training in multiple territories including Network Rail’s PTS.\nOne is told frequently that trains are not built in anticipation of anything lying between the rails and frequently have protrusions/odd bits of kit hanging low enough that they would catch anybody foolish enough to try it.\nStandard operating procedure is to lie in the ‘Cess’ (by-the-rail space) or between tracks (ie between pairs of rails) as equidistant as possible, if one can’t make it to the side.\nLie between the rails and you risk becoming mincemeat.",
      "16": "“In movies, people survive a train by laying down on the track. Is this possible? Can you lay down on the train tracks and have the train go over you without harm?”\nThe odds are better than standing up in the path of the train.\nIf the train passes over you, there is a reasonable chance that you may survive but a lot depends on the train, the track, the sleepers (cross-ties), the level of ballast and the speed of the train.\nIn contrast to the certainty of death by standing in the path of the train, a likely 90% chance of survival when lying down sounds good. In the context of virtually 100% chance of survival by not being in the path of the train, 90% chance looks pretty close to the odds of Russian Roulette.\nIt’s last resort in an emergency. Not something to try for thrills.",
      "17": "This man is one of my personal heroes.\nIn 2007, construction worker Wesley Autrey (pictured above) took his daughters on a trip. They were waiting for the subway at 137th street in New York City, when Autrey noticed a young stranger having a seizure on the platform.\nTo all the straphangers’ horror, Cameron Hollopeter, a 20-year old with epilepsy, fell right off the platform and onto the tracks, just as a the 1 train barrelled into the station.\nThe subway driver honked his horn desperately, but he couldn’t stop in time. The train headed straight for Hollopeter. The people waiting on the platform were horrified. What could they do?\nWithout hesitating (there was no time to hesitate), Autrey lept down onto the tracks and pushed Hollopeter flat on the track. Then, he lay down on top of the panicked man and the two of them pressed down as flat as they could. The train barrelled over the pair, and came to a stop.\nAutrey and Hollopeter were trapped under the train, lying in a pool of muddy water, with about an inch of clearance overhead, for nearly an hour until rescue workers were able to get them out.\nBoth men emerged unscathed from the scare",
      "18": "No.\nHollywood fakes it.\nAnd that could be the end, but. All trains are not the same.\nStory time. Oh and this is a true story, about a dog, a rather small Jack Russell. This dog in my home town used to play game it loved. Run out into the road, suck under a car, and jump for joy, after the car passed over. One day the car had a trailer. Dead dog.\nYou are in exactly the same situation. Things, hang under trains, drains, hydraulics, cargo straps, damaged metal. Just one thing hiting you, and it's dead you, or worse, you love long enough to be ripped to pieces.\nAnd quite frankly if you have time to jump between the rails, you have time to jump out of the way.",
      "19": "It’s possible but not guaranteed.\nAn important variable is the rail height, which is typically related to the trains using the line. While some light rails can use as low as 4.5″ high rail stock, modern ones for heavy trains can be as high as 8″. Obviously there is more room to scooch under a higher rail profile.\nIt also depends on how are the trains built underneath. Some have signal detectors pretty close to the top level of the rail, therefore not giving much extra clearance. But more basic trains can have a significant clearance to the lowest mechanical part. And even if there is a low mounted detector under the train, it is a narrow piece of equipment which does not take anywhere near the full width of the train, so you might make it by being closer to one of the rails (off center).\nMaybe this picture can help: the yellow box hanging from the train is the data detector, and the also yellow thing laid on the track is the balise...",
      "20": "Yes. I know one of my close relatives who worked in RPF and was on duty. He was close to his retirement and was about to retire only after a year or less from the date on incident. He was going to the rear coach when he slipped on the track. The coach he was in, was just next to the engine (As usual for RPF.) He couldn't notice that the coaches were connected and got slipped on the track because of his carelessness or old age, not sure which one to blame.\nAfter he fell on the tracks the news got spread everywhere that he died. Everyone at his home has started crying assuming he was no more, but the news was to be proven wrong only after a few minutes. As the train passed, he came out with some scratches and torn clothes. People who got to talk to him on that day, heard him saying that he kept himself squeezed in as narrow place as possible while the whole train passed above him.",
      "21": "This can work for NYC subway trains in places where they have the drainage ditch in the middle. Several people have escaped death by getting into the ditch. It's always better to get out of the train's way entirely if you can, but when that's not possible, the ditch normally works.\nThere was a guy who saved another guy a few years ago by getting on top of him in the ditch when he had a convulsion.",
      "22": "Highly unlikely. For one thing, nearly every operating motor has some type of cowcatcher; usually serving double-duty as a snow plow. Which means it's close to the rails. You see, the railroads don't want anything going under their trains. That's a recipe for derailment. So the cowcatcher would (you hope) push you off the rails, as it is designed to do. If there is for some reason no cowcatcher and you managed to get the operating motor to pass over you, you'll wish there had been a cowcatcher. Trains have lots of things hanging down and protruding from their undercarriages. Those things serve a purpose and need to be accessible, thus they are more-or-less unprotected because, you know, what would someone be doing under a moving train? That's where your troubles really begin though because unless you have knowledge of the locations of the low hanging objects, it's a certainty you'll be either whacked on the melon…fatally, or snagged and dragged. An undesirable fate I should say.\nStay off railroad tracks!\n**edit** the things that hang down and protrude don't do so enough to drag on the tracks, obviously. But they can be within a foot or so of the roadbed. Close enough to smite you or grab you.\nIt's been mentioned that trains engaging in other-than-head-end operations would have cars with no cowcatcher leading the train. In this case you'll definitely go under probably with the air hoses smacking you up. But these are slow speed moves and you just might survive…for a period. I wouldn't count on it though.\nStay. Off. Railroad. Tracks.\nAnd for god's sake don't try to duplicate movie stunts.",

Just drumming it into the three of us that “If you are on the tracks and a train is coming, this is what you need to do”.\nBut then my mother used to dunk us kids into rivers and creeks that now have prominently displayed ‘Croc Warning’ signs along them.\nEver wondered if your parents were secretly trying to kill you?!?",
      "27": "No, it is not possible to survive a train by laying down on the track. Trains are extremely heavy and can weigh several tons, and they travel at high speeds. Even if a person is lying flat on the tracks, they can still be hit by debris or caught in the train's slipstream, which can cause serious injury or death. Additionally, trains often have parts that protrude from the sides, such as steps and handrails, which can also cause injury. It is never safe to be on or near train tracks, and people should always stay clear of them.",
      "28": "As recently as the early 1990s a member of the public did exactly this on the Braintree branch in Essex in England.\nI remember reading about the incident. He apparently fell asleep on the train and missed his stop, and found himself at Braintree station which is the end of the line. It was very late at night and there were no more passenger trains departing from Braintree that night. He decided to walk back to his stop along the track. what he didn’t take into account was the fact that no trains are stabled overnight in Braintree and so the train would return to Witham out of service. He was walking along the track and heard the train approaching from behind.\nIt is worth noting that the station Braintree Freeport didn’t exist back then. If it had, it may have afforded him a way off the track. He decided to lay down in the ‘Four foot’ and let the train roll over him. The train in question would have been a Class 312 Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) as built by British Rail between 1975 and 1978. The train ran straight over him without harming him. It is worth noting that not long after this occurred, the majority of trains serving the Braintree branch became worked by much newer Class 321 EMUs as built by British Rail Engineering Limited between 1988 and 1991, as they still are today. Had the train in question been formed of a Class 321, he would have been most likely fatally injured.\nThe individual in question was subsequently prosecuted for trespassing on the railway line.",

      "35": "In the early days of Steam trains it was sometimes possible to survive by lying centrally between the rails (in the gap some railway people call “the four foot”). So long as there were no hanging coupling chains you might have got away with it. Early trains had large diameter wheels, and locomotives only had outside cylinders.\nFrom about 1880, and anywhere with snowploughs or cow-catchers, you would be doomed.\nYou stand a better chance by laying on the ground between tracks (In the “six foot”). Any train designed for the standard loading gauge (i.e. to go through stations with platforms) should have no projecting parts in that area, and with modern ballasting techniques you might gain another 300mm of depth there.\nThe Antrim line, Knockmore, Lisburn... (C) Albert Bridge\nThis one is problematic. The two “six foot” gaps have surplus ballast piled up. Why would you not roll off to the left and lie safely in the gully near the speed limit sign?",
      "36": "It is possible, IF they’re very skinny and lie flat and there isn’t a build-up of ballast between the rails (as there often is).\nA standard rail is about 7″ (170mm) high, and obviously no part of the train can dangle below rail level or it would hit the diverging rails on points (turnouts). So there must be at least 7″ clearance between the sleepers (cross-ties) and the lowest point of the train. However, if the ballast (rubble) has been allowed to build up over the top of the sleepers (cross-ties) between the rails then there will obviously be less clearance.\nSo, it is possible that people have survived, if they were very lucky (and also quite skinny). It is far more likely on any given occasion that they wouldn’t, and the results are not pretty. Would I bet my life on it? - not ever.\nThere is a difference in many underground (subway) stations, where the gap between the rails is a pit, several feet deep - obviously that vastly improves the odds. Urban legend has it that these pits were added precisely to stop people committing dramatic suicide by throwing themselves in front of the train.",

Trains are large and heavy vehicles that move at high speeds, and they are not able to stop quickly or easily. Laying down on the tracks would not provide any protection from the force of a train passing over you, and it is highly likely that you would be seriously injured or killed.\nIf you find yourself on or near train tracks, the best course of action is to move away from the tracks as quickly and safely as possible. If you are unable to move away from the tracks, you should stay as far away from the tracks as possible and lie flat on the ground, covering your ears to protect them from the noise of the train.\nIt is also important to remember that trains are not the only hazard on or near train tracks. The tracks themselves can be slippery, and there may be other dangers such as electrical wires or equipment. It is important to stay alert and avoid any contact with train tracks or other rail-related infrastructure.",
      "45": "I’m not sure that’s possible most trains or at least modern ones have a fixture on the front to move snow like a plow or scoop device… if it weren’t for that I guess the answer would be that it would depend on how fat the person was….",
      "46": "It is technically possible, but the margin for error is so low that most people could not manage it.\nAt least in the US, most “mainline” heavy rail between 4″ to 6″ high, and it is sitting a few fractions of an inch higher than the ties on tie plates. The locomotives and freight cars are at a minimum, 2″ above the railhead, though they may pass a little higher.\nIf you were to lay as flat as humanly possible, and you can clear 8″, then you have a chance. The problem is that even if you manage to hold yourself as low as possible during the entire ordeal, this does not mean that there is not low-hanging equipment. Least-case scenario, you get badly smacked by a low hose. The more likely/worst case scenario is that the low hanging part of the train will either catch you and drag you to your likely death, or cause a piece of you to get pulled up, at which point the train will just roll you up like a bug ground between your fingers.\nHowever, many subways in the Northeast that I’ve ridden on have shallow drainage areas between the rails, that allow for additional space. In those cases, you probably could survive laying low under the train, as you can get below the height of the ties. Still, you could get burned by electrical equipment under the subway, as well as still caught and dragged by some unsecured part of the subway.\nThe bottom line is that it is ALWAYS better to get out from between the rails if you can. If you’re in a tunnel, lay down in the bottom corner outside the rails. Same thing on a railroad bridge, if you can find a way to hang onto the sides. It is way less likely that any equipment will be hanging very low on the outer sides of the train, and the farther you can get, the better.",

Shearing is essential to a sheep’s welfare, health, and life.\nSheep also *love* having their wool taken off! Although the machinery is noisy and a bit stressful the first time, many sheep literally jump for joy to feel the air on their skin again. My oldest pet sheep, LambLamb, demands her wool removed whenever she wants it. She stands in the shearing place and will not leave!\nNow that we’ve covered the happy sheep that got shorn, lets take a look at what happens to sheep that missed out.\nIt gets very, very grim for them from here; and climate change has made it much worse in the last 20 years.\nAlthough you often see ‘feral’ sheep that have survived years without muster and being shorn, most die horribly within a few months of when they should have been shorn.\nFirst, flies lay eggs on top of it’s wool.\nThe maggots hatch and burrow down to the skin. They start to eat the sheep alive. The sheep’s damaged skin goes rotten and smells, attracting more flies.\nThe maggots (litres of them) eat right through to the sheep’s internal organs. The sheep dies of septicaemia and organ failure. This happens in about 48–72 hours from the first eggs being laid.\nSo shearing is extremely important. The examples of sheep like Shrek that have been unshorn for years are misleading; they are just the few survivors.\nThe image below is the least graphic I could find. It is a sheep that has been captured for shearing and medicine just in time, hopefully, to save her. But notice this sheep had only a few months of wool growth, so it was quite short, clean, and white before the flies got to her. This shows how often farmers need to shear their sheep.",
      "3": "Sheep are typically sheared once or twice a year to remove their wool. If a sheep is not sheared, its wool will continue to grow and can become very long and matted. This can cause a number of problems for the sheep, including:\nDifficulty moving: Long, matted wool can make it difficult for a sheep to move around, which can affect its ability to graze and access food and water.\nHealth problems: Matting can cause the wool to trap dirt, moisture, and parasites, which can lead to skin irritation and infections. In severe cases, the wool can become so matted that it can cause serious health problems, such as flystrike (an infestation of fly eggs on the skin).\nHeat stress: Sheep are adapted to regulate their body temperature through their wool. However, long, matted wool can prevent heat from dissipating properly, leading to heat stress.\nOverall, it is important to shear sheep regularly to prevent these problems and ensure the health and well-being of the animal.",
      "4": "If a sheep is not sheared, its wool will continue to grow and eventually become very heavy. This can be uncomfortable and even painful for the sheep, as the excess wool can restrict movement and cause skin irritation. Additionally, the excess wool can make it difficult for the sheep to regulate its body temperature and can lead to overheating in warm weather.\nIn the wild, sheep naturally shed their wool in the spring. Domestic sheep, however, have been bred to produce wool at a much faster rate than their wild counterparts, so they need to be sheared regularly to prevent the wool from becoming too heavy. If a sheep is not sheared, it can suffer from a variety of health problems, including parasites, infections, and overheating. It is important to keep sheep well-groomed and sheared regularly to ensure their health and well-being.",
      "5": "If a sheep is not sheared, its wool will continue to grow and eventually become long, thick and matted. This can lead to several health problems and discomfort for the sheep.\nFirstly, the thick wool can trap dirt, moisture and feces close to the skin, which can cause skin irritation, infections and other diseases. This can also attract insects such as flies, which can lay eggs and cause maggots to develop, leading to a condition called flystrike. Flystrike can be deadly if left untreated.\nSecondly, the heavy wool can cause the sheep to overheat, especially in warmer weather, as it prevents the animal from regulating its body temperature properly. This can lead to heat exhaustion, dehydration and even death.\nFinally, the weight of the wool can also cause the sheep to become immobile, making it difficult for them to move around and find food and water.\nTherefore, it is important to shear sheep regularly to ensure their health and well-being. Shearing also helps to produce high-quality wool and prevents the animal from suffering from the above-mentioned health issues.",
      "6": "Wool sheep? It can mean a miserable death.\nThis wool is heavy and breeds maggots.\nHair sheep, meat breeds? Not much as they shed annually like your dog does.",
      "7": "If sheep are not sheared, their wool will continue to grow, become matted and dirty, and eventually overheat them, leading to heat stress, flystrike, and other health issues. The weight of the wool can also cause sheep to become immobilized, making it difficult for them to move around and eat, and increasing the risk of predation. In some extreme cases, the buildup of wool can even lead to suffocation or death. Therefore, it is essential for the health and well-being of the sheep to shear them regularly.",
      "8": "If a sheep is not sheared, its wool will continue to grow and eventually become matted, tangled and heavy. This can cause various problems for the sheep such as:\nOverheating: The thick wool coat can trap heat, causing the sheep to overheat, especially during hot weather.\nMobility Issues: The heavy wool can make it difficult for the sheep to move around, causing strain on its joints and hindering its ability to graze and access food and water.\nSkin Irritation: The matted wool can rub against the skin, causing pain, discomfort and sores.\nAttracts Parasites: The thick wool can harbor ticks, lice, and other parasites that can infest the sheep and cause further health issues.\nDecreased Fleece Quality: If a sheep is not sheared regularly, the wool quality decreases and is less valuable for commercial use.\nIn summary, regular shearing is important for the overall health and well-being of the sheep, as well as for the quality and value of the wool produced. If a sheep is not sheared, its wool will continue to grow, causing various health and mobility issues, and decreased fleece quality.",

      "1": "The CNN represented Western propaganda forces would answer:\nBecause the CPC-led Chinese government does not have press freedom, it blocked free access by foreign medias, it manipulated the Uygurs and forbade them to accept interviews from Western medias, it covered up all the truths……\nA Chinese answer:\nBecause there are no “genocide”, no “two million mistreated Uygurs,” “no forced labor,” “no forced sterilization,” “no systematic rape on Uygur women”.\nBut they would rather turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to all Chinese voices and hence, they decided to find out the “truth”.\nAnd yes, they did it. They did interview at least one “mistreated” Uygur family, and came up with this report.\nCNN finds stranded Uyghur children in China | CNN\nCNN finds stranded Uyghur children in China | CNN\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2021/03/24/china-xinjiang-children-culver-pkg-intl-hnk-vpx.cnn\nThe couple in the video are from Xinjiang, but went abroad more than 10 years ago. In 2015, the wife brought the two children back to Kashgar, but the husband complains “he hadn't seen his children for many years because of China's ‘sweeping government crackdown against Muslim minorities’.\nBut unfortunately, they were soon been slapped on the face by the family they interviewed and Chinese media outlet CGTN.\nUygur family disturbed by CNN reporters asks son to come home\nSoon after CNN's report, CGTN interviewed the man's two children and his parents. It turned out that the man, Mamutjan Abdurehim, hasn't been in contact with his family for five years, much earlier than the time when some western media's so-called \"re-education camp\" began.\nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-24/Uygur-family-disturbed-by-CNN-reporters-asks-son-to-come-home-YTtL9kD8go/index.html\nIt turns out the CNN journalists cheated the 10-year-old kid, Muhlisa, lying that they are “classmates” of the father to win over their trust, and misled the kid there would be chance to reunite with his father in Australia!\n“Muhlisa recalled that several days ago, three ‘uncles’ stopped by with photos of her father.\n‘They said they were my father's classmates. They told me my father is now in Australia and asked if I want to go there to reunite with him. I said I don't want to go abroad. I want to stay in Kashgar,’ said Muhlisa.”\n“It turned out that the man, Mamutjan Abdurehim, hasn't been in contact with his family for five years, much earlier than the time when some western media's so-called ‘re-education camp’ began.\nAblat Abdureyim, Mamutjan's father, said that the family's last phone conversation with Mamutjan was in April 2017.”\n“According to Ablat, Mamutjan got married in 2009 in Xinjiang after completing his master's degree. Forty-five days later, he departed to Malaysia with his wife.\nAblat added that from 2009 to 2013, his son would come back home once a year. But soon, the annual visit stopped. In 2015, Ablat's daughter-in-law brought the two children back to Kashgar, and his son remained abroad.\nIn CNN's report, Mamutjan claimed that his wife was arrested by the Chinese government when they came back to China to get a new passport in December 2015. So he couldn't come back because he would be at risk of being detained if he returned.\nWhile, a fact is that Mamutjan's wife, Muharram Ablat, was arrested on suspicion of provoking ethnic hatred in 2019, nearly four years after his wife came back to Xinjiang. And when his wife was arrested, Mamutjan hadn't contacted his family in Xinjiang for two years.\nSince the children's mother is detained and the father is abroad, the two children have been left to stay between their paternal and maternal grandparents.”\nNow, I have several questions for CNN:\nQuestion 1: If China is as claimed by CNN and other Western medias that it does not allow foreign journalists, and even foreigners, into Xinjiang, how did they get there? Do they look like Chinese? Did they enter Xinjiang with Chinese identity cards?\nQuestion 2: If there are so many “concentration camps,” how many did the CNN reporters find out? Why did not they make those “concentration camps” headlines on Western medias? Instead, just a biased report on a selected family of the “mistreated Uygurs”?\nDon’t tell me, as “professional journalists”, they overcame all possible “blockades” and escaped from the “tight scrutiny” by CPC, and made their way into Xinjiang, their only purpose is there to meet this ONE family, out of all those “two million mistreated”.\nI would rather believe they are there to collect as many as possible the “criminal evidence” by CPC. Then, why keep all those “evidence” to themselves instead of making them headlines? The latter supposedly should be their mission, right?\nThe only possible answer I can come up is: There is NONE.\nQuestion 3: if CNN goes on with its own logic, there are “forced sterilization on Uygur women”, then how could this wife give birth to two kids if being sterilized?\nQuestion 4: if CNN goes on with its own logic, there are “genocide on Uygurs”, then could CNN explain what kind of genocide it is — a Uygur woman can give birth to two kids, while I, myself, a Han woman, can only have one kid?\nQuestion 5: Is this the so-called “professional journalism”? Which text book has taught CNN journalists to cheat a 10-year-old, in order to smear China with twisted reports?",
      "2": "I doubt that CNN found any family that has been mistreated by the Chinese government. All that CNN and other US mass media does is make accusations without any credible evidence. For example, they show a building and claim it to be a concentration camp or re-education camp or whatever they fancy. No actual evidence is ever shown. But they expect people who listen (or read) to believe them. And, unfortunately, some people do.",
      "3": "Did CNN find 3 Uighur families? I don’t trust anything CNN claims.\nI don’t trust anything Western media claims about China. Western media is unambiguously biased against China. It’s complicit with the US government to disseminate propaganda rhetoric and disinformation.",
      "4": "It’s near miracle that CCP henchmen would allow CCN or any foreign journalist to talk to oppressed Uyghurs. The three families could have been staged by CCP agents to act out some minor grievance in front of the CNN film crew. We must never underestimate CCP’s insidious abilities to manipulate the press.",

Dalai Lama’s gift that is displayed in the White House: the full body skin of a slave killed for inadequate workmanship.\nIn China, you will find MILLIONS of happy Uyghurs earning a honest living. And in case you are asking, the farm slaves in Tibet has been freed and some are now even owner of their own land to farm.\nIf all that’s not clear, you have been lied to by the expert in fake news: CNN.",

    "title": "Could Data pass the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek",
    "answers": {
      "1": "I think Data would probably use the “Sulu” solution. In the novel Kobyashi Maru, Sulu assesses the situation and decides not to breach the Neutral Zone and risk an interstellar war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.\nHe was able to look at the “big picture” and calculated that the risk to his ship and crew plus the potential millions or billions of deaths from an all out war outweighed the lives of the Maru crew, and there was enough sensor interference to make it debatable that this was a genuine emergency instead of a Klingon trap.\nSulu instead elected to contact Starfleet Command and try to get a message to the Klingons to get permission to take his ship into the Zone to attempt a rescue.\nData would likely dispassionately come to the same conclusion- the risks are too great compared to the number of lives on the Maru.",
      "2": "Of course.\nOnly one person is known to ever have failed the Kobayashi Maru scenario, and that’s James Tiberius Kirk.\nThe thing is that it’s not a test of the cadet’s ability to carry out a rescue mission. It’s a test of the cadet’s ability to face defeat – to do the right thing even when defeat was inevitable. And famously, Kirk rejected the very notion that there even existed a no-win scenario; in a way, he failed the test by refusing defeat.\nData would certainly have accepted that his ship and crew were lost, but would possibly have been able to devise a defense that destroyed the enemy, resulting in what you might term a draw.",
      "3": "People have some very strange ideas about that test.\nThe Kobayashi Maru isn't testing the Cadet's competence. It's testing their character. The instructors want to see how their students react when presented with a situation where failure is inevitable. And there is literally nothing you could do that would result in you failing a test like that. You could...\nRefuse to take it.\nForget to set your alarm and sleep through it.\nSelf destruct the ship five seconds in.\n...And all of these would be considered passing, because it would still tell the people administering the exam exactly what they were trying to learn.\nThe cadets that get hung up on the test do so because they are too obsessed with proving their technical competence to consider that competence alone doesn't make a good Captain. Which, once again, is a valid result.\nData almost certainly was subjected to a variety of these tests before being allowed up graduate even if he never had reason to take the Kobayashi Maru itself. And I'm sure the results of those tests would have caused a great deal of debate on how one teaches effective leadership to a being with overwhelming intelligence and no emotional awareness to speak of. If I had to guess based on how Data was presented in season one they would probably be most concerned with making sure he wasn't so scrupulous in his adherence to regulations that he couldn't handle a scenario where they happened to be in conflict.\n…But based on that we saw in “Peak Performance,\" he'd probably end up being one of the obsessive cadets who took the thing multiple times trying to improve his score.",
      "4": "Well, the Kobayashi Maru is designed to be a no-win scenario, so technically, no one can pass it.\nHowever, Captain Kirk famously reprogrammed the simulation to allow for a victory, and it's possible that someone with Data's intelligence and abilities could find a loophole or flaw in the simulation to achieve a similar outcome.\nPlus, as an android, Data is not prone to the same emotional responses as humans, which could give him an advantage in dealing with the stress and pressure of the situation. So, I think that Data could potentially find a way to beat the Kobayashi Maru.",
      "5": "Here’s the short answer to your question: he wouldn’t want to.\nAnd now the long answer: One of the (many) cool things about Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is that the film contrasts Kirk’s ability to cheat death with Spock’s ability to self-sacrifice. Even in the Star Trek reboot Spock talks about the test being designed to have people face their fears. If it’s a test, then Data with his trillions of calculations per second, should be able to outsmart the test and figure out how to save everyone in record time, right? Well, let’s keep in mind a few things. Here’s the big one: Data is not infallible.\nIn the episode “Peak Performance” Data goes up against a Zakdorn named Sirna Kolrami and loses at a game called Strategema. Everyone is shocked, including Data, who removes himself from active duty because he thinks there’s something wrong with him. Data cleverly decides in his rematch to not play to win, but to stalemate his opponent. Kolrami quits out of frustration, and Data gets points for attacking Kolrami where he’s most vulnerable: his ego. He still could have lost, but instead of thinking like a computer trying to outthink his opponent, he used his wits. Let’s also remember another thing: Data values relationships.\nIn the seventh season episode “Gambit” Data takes command of the Enterprise and appoints Worf his First Officer. Data doesn’t like how Worf is performing and although the most efficient action would be just to get rid of him, he explains using examples why Worf’s performance is sub-par and offers him another chance to do better. On top of that, Data expresses regret that his actions, although necessary, may have permanently damaged their friendship. His actions don’t show the side of a cold, calculating machine, but someone who cares about Worf’s growth, he wants Worf to learn and recover from a mistake, and most of all, he still wants to be able to know at the end of the day that he can call him friend. He handles the situation in a very empathic way.\nSo, if Data were to do the Kobayashi Maru, he would have wanted to experience the inevitable outcome (failure), because would want to undergo a very human experience: face fears, contemplate loss, and grapple with the crippling notion of futility.",
      "6": "No.\nNobody passes the Kobayashi Maru test. That’s the point. It’s not just a really, really hard test which can be beaten with sufficient cleverness. It’s a no-win scenario, built that way on purpose. If it could be beaten, Kirk et al wouldn’t talk about it as the no-win scenario. Indeed, judging by the weird way the scenario played out on Prodigy, it appears to adapt itself to ensure a loss. The only way to beat it, as Kirk figured out, was to change the conditions of the test. In short, to cheat. Data, for all his cleverness, is too ethical to do that. He wouldn’t pass Kobayashi Maru.",
      "7": "Yes, just not on the first try.\nLike everybody else who approaches the Kobayashi Maru simulation, Data would attempt to overcome the odds and rescue the crew.\nLike everyone else, Data would fail.\nData would then go into a retrospective session, first running diagnostics to determine a mechanical or computational error, then seeking advice.\nEventually, Data would realize that the point of the simulation is not to rescue the crew, but face the fact that\nHaving understood the lesson, Data would try again, but with a different approach, one that the computer cannot defeat.\nThis is not to reject the lesson, but to demonstrate that Data is not just a walking computer.",
      "8": "Yes. I don’t think it’d be a very difficult test to a Starfleet cadet.\nIn abandoning ship, there are doubtlessly procedures and drills to follow. The test is about maintaining command of the ship and crew while executing a correct “abandon ship” drill. Spock says as much in the first JJ Abrams film.\nGo back to the Kobyashi Mary scenes in Star Trek 2. Compare them with the scenes in Star Trek 2009.\nAs a cadet, Kirk reprogrammes the computer to make it possible to win. His manner is cocky, self satisfied. He’s joking around and showing off. He’s arrogant. It’s not appealing. You can see Uhura rolling her eyes at him.\nThe scenes in TWOK show really interesting character development for Kirk. I really love them.\nMcCoy, one of Kirk’s oldest friends, says something like “you are looking at the only cadet ever to beat the Kobyashi Maru.” He’s half-smiling. He’s not praising Kirk, he’s teasing him. He knows exactly how his friend feels about his earlier behaviour and is teasing him.\nHow does Kirk respond? Reluctantly. He doesn’t want to be drawn on it. HE’S EMBARRASSED. Now 50, he looks back on his behaviour in his youth and recognises it as foolish and arrogant and he’s embarrassed. His behaviour wasn’t heroic. It demonstrated a character flaw and looking back, he recognised that. Those scenes are really great.\nData would have efficiently evacuated the ship and passed the test.",
      "9": "Remember, the Kobayashi Maru is unbeatable on purpose unless you reprogram the computer. It’s not an “a really good captain can beat it” situation. The program cheats, and the only way to “win” the simulation is to cheat yourself.\nYou “pass” by showing what kind of captain you would be as inevitable defeat becomes more and more obvious. And knowing that is more valuable to Starfleet than yet another test of your tactical acumen (of which there have undoubtedly been many before the “no-win situation” test).\nKirk got a commendation for original thinking for being the first one to consider reprogramming the simulator, but that’s really not the point of the test. As we saw when Kirk’s test was portrayed in the Kelvin timeline, he nearly got thrown out of Starfleet for the stunt before they decided that his kind of lateral thinking could also be valuable in the captain’s chair.",
      "10": "Yes of course… probably very fast. He’s shown to follow the logical necessity based off the evidence, and the evidence is that the Kobiashu Maru could not be rescued.\nThat said… to be clear:\nThe Kobiashu Maru exercise is not a test, it’s a lesson. Something that gets spelled out so many times on-screen. So you don’t actually pass or fail it. Well … you can fail to learn the lesson.\nThe students are kinda told it’s a test, in a way… so that they will be committed to trying to complete the mission. ie. their instructors are lying to them. (That’s Kirk’s complaint in the Kelvin timeline.)\nIt seems more that it is a scenario in a collection of simulations cadets are expected to try as part of their training. Being included in the set invites the inference that it is doable.\nThe point of the lesson is that students cannot achieve the specified mission objectives… they need to come to terms with this, and, as a result, grow as leaders. Become more mature and grown up. Have a more balanced and grounded viewpoint.\nThe only way to “fail” is to achieve the mission objectives. In fact… the exercise has failed it’s purpose if students think of it as a pass/fail situation. Crews are not failing if they do not rescue the Kobiashu Maru.\nThe point of Kirk’s cheating story is that he was unique in failing to learn the lesson… (and still become a captain.)",
      "11": "There is no “pass.” Even Nog’s “solution” isn’t a pass. The test is about how you deal with an unwinnable situation. Although Star Trek is a fantasy world, that’s actually a very valid and legitimate test. “Winning” or “Beating” the test under its own terms undermines the purpose of the test.\nKirk’s “winning” solution is really the only valid “win” ever presented, although it doesn’t actually beat the test under its own terms, which is the whole point. The point of Kirk’s “victory” is that “I will absolutely cheat and break every rule in the book, if that’s what it takes to save my ship and my crew.” At the time (late 23rd Century), that kind of “Cowboy” attitude was largely valued and rewarded. That type of solution would probably have been frowned upon in Picard’s academy years.\nIf an officer actually outsmarts the computer and wins the scenario under its own terms, then the exercise is pointless. The whole point is to see how an officer confronts the no-win scenario, not to figure out some ingenious way to win. Even in the reboot (2009 film), Kirk realizes this (“The test itself is a cheat.”).",
      "12": "In one of my fanfics, I had this theory that the Kobayashi Maru test *was* sometimes beaten, and that Starfleet used it to collect really outré ideas - oh, we didn’t think of that one, better adapt our ships so nobody can do that to *us*. Things like using the transporter to remove the shielding on the other ship’s engines.",
      "13": "Data attended and graduated Starfleet with honors. The implication throughout the series (reinforced by what we see of Wesley Crusher’s academy time) is that cadets still go through - if not exactly KM - some sort of “test of the mettle of a man.”\nFurther, Data had that one episode where he found himself in command in battle in a situation that required some really dire and risky decisions. I don’t recall the episode and don’t feel compelled to look it up but most TNG fans know the one I’m referring to. It’s probably the most Kobayashi-esque of any scenario that’s been shown onscreen other than Wrath of Khan’s simulator… and he succeeded there.\nSo, yes, all indications are that Data must have done well and would do well in Kobayashi Maru or something similar.",
      "14": "Nope!\nNobody can pass the Kobayashi Maru. That’s the entire point of it. Yes, Kirk managed to “win” but he didn’t beat the actual test he basically hacked it, put in cheat codes, and literally changed the conditions of the test he never actually beat it, he beat whatever he turned it into. The actual test is unwinnable it doesn’t matter how smart Data is. He devises some crafty ass way to actually disable or destroy the 3 Klingon ships that ambushed him the test will just send three more, then three more, then three more. It will just keep sending them and taking his systems out until the ship has shot it’s last torpedo and the batteries are dead. Nothing else matters except how the captain handles himself and his crew facing certain death. The test will do what it has to in order to ensure that happens regardless of what data can come up with.\nShort of pulling a Kirk that is and using game genie codes.",
      "15": "UPDATED\nIf he doesnt cheat?\nPossibly but only if he had countless tries\nWatch the film Star Trek from 2009\nIn both the prime and the Kelvin timeline James Kirk altered the test in Starfleet making it possible for him to rescue the ship\nIn Star Trek Video Game Starfleet Academy( not Canon) they mention some possibilities (on how to cheat)\nNormally the test is designed to be unwinnable..\nit's in test of character.

And I don't think that Starfleet would have let a person take it 200 times just to find a weakness in the programming.\nHere is a video from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ,where we are introduced to the test.\nThe Original Kobayashi Maru test was vs Klingons\nThe upgraded version was against Romulans( as at the time the Klingons were/are allies and had a treaty and there was NO more Klingon Neutral Zone following the Khitomer Accords\nHeres how it works, The crew during the simulation recieve a distress call from the ship Kobayashi Maru. it is in the neutral zone\nentering it would violate the Treaty with the Klingons.. therein lies the conundrum.\nTypically during the first or 2nd try there is only so many ways to solve this:\nDo you ignore it? honoring the treaty? even if it means the death of innocents?\nDo you attempt a rescue? If either side enters and is detected, this constitutes an act of war. IF you try, several Klingon ships( or Romulans in the newer version) decloak & attack you. In comparison to the firepower of your ship, you are hopelessly outmanned and outgunned .Even if you are able to destroy 1, or 2 …or ALL ships by some miracle. several more enemy vessels quickly show up . Now you are once again outnumbered, but now your ship is severely damaged\nDo you try to escape if you see yourself outnumbered and dont want to appear like Starfleet just violated the treaty?No good, as you may find yourself without warp drive, OR they may catch up to you and kill you WHILE you are escaping at warp\nSo as you can see, you have little options at first.\nDal won only because he had countless tries and found a flaw in whoever programmed the test. But it might have been luck more than anything.\nThe person who programmed the Kobayashi Maru test is an imperfect being. Since the being is not perfect,that means there's always a possibility that would only mean that the programming was flawed.\nBut Data and Dal are also imperfect and it would take them many tries to eventually figure it out. But I think the point is you're not supposed to keep trying.\nAs I said it is a test of character because when you're around in space you might come across a situation that you just cannot win.\nSo what do you do?\nDo you destroy yourself to prevent an enemy from capturing your ship?\nDo you go down fighting?\nDo you try to escape?\nDo you not bother risking your ship????\nThat's what the test is about. Its a psychological test\nThink of it as like a Rorschach test. It's supposed to have Starfleet know what kind of person you are.\nAre you aggressive?\nAre you careful?\nAre you cunning?\nAre you too by the book?\nThat would go in your Starfleet file and that's why the test is so important.. Any future commander would read this for any of your future postings.\nWatch the TNG episode Tapestry to understand why the Kobayashi Maru test is used\nOriginally ,Picard was bold because he had a near death experience. but in an alternate timeline he had no such experience so he lived life very cautious and never rose to command duties, He was at most a worker bee. if i had to guess, this version of Picard probably didnt risk his ship in the Starfleet test.\nThats not to say that everyone in command is reckless. Just sometimes take risks and stand out. be a leader.\nKirk did not believe in a no win scenario and while there are always options ( as Worf once said) that doesn't necessarily mean that those options can end up having you victorious in the end.\nKirk was just lucky in his entire career that he never ran into a truly unwinnable situation. But there is always no win scenarios..\nFor example, in Star Trek Into Darkness Kirk would have been killed if it wasn't for Scotty sabotaging the Vengeance.\nThat was a no win scenario\nThe enemy ship had more powerful weapons, it was faster and just more advanced in every way. You couldn't run or hide from it. And it was clearly far more rugged as it was able to survive Photon torpedo explosions inside and still remain intact.\nThey all should have been killed. The only reason why they didn't is because of plot armor.. sheer Luck.\nUPDATE\nHowever. the only reason why Dal beat the test was . according to the ep, beamed on board the Klingon ship and then disabled or killed the crew. But the BOP would have shields up so this is a major plot hole as it would prevent Dal from transporting to their ship during battle\nSo this may be Lazy writing in Prodigy to prove you can beat the Kobayashi Maru Test after all!. But as long as there are flaws in it including the one I mentioned\n,",
      "16": "No because the Kobiyashi is designed to be a no win Scenerio. It cannot be won or beat. Only reason Kirk did was because he cheated and reprogrammed the test to be beatable\nData would know this and despite all his calculations would see that there's no scenerio where he can accomplish the Test mission and goal",
      "17": "While it’s an amazing piece of Star Trek lore and was put to great use in Star Trek’s best movie, the Kobayashi Maru test would never work in real life.\nThe point of the Kobayashi Maru is to experience the unwinnable situation. Many members of Starfleet are hyper-successful. They’re the best of the best, the most over-achieving over-achievers you’ve ever seen. Athletic, supremely intelligent, and driven. The Kobayashi Maru is a means to introduce cadets and junior officers to facets of the real world, and in real life there are times when you can’t win. Life isn’t just a scaled-up version of some academy test, it’s bigger and more dangerous and there guarantees that there is a right answer among the options.\nAlso…you can die.\nThere’s a good reason to introduce young officers and cadets to all of these concepts. The Kobayashi Maru is the in-universe way Starfleet did this with some students.\nIt would never work though. The key factor in making the Kobayashi Maru test work is that the people taking it would need to think the test was legit and solvable. Serving an overachieving cadet a hot bowl of failure to digest is the whole point, and once everyone knows that the test isn’t beatable then it loses all its psychological power. That feeling of surprise and failure that Saavik experienced in The Wrath of Khan is the point.\nThe very question of whether Data could “pass” the Kobayashi Maru test misunderstands it. There’s no “passing” this test, there’s simply experiencing it and hopefully gaining some maturity and perspective from the experience. Data couldn’t pass this test, because no one can pass it. Even Kirk didn’t pass it, despite his legendary bit of cheating. Starfleet commended his ingenuity, but otherwise the victory meant nothing. It wasn’t some test that he had to pass before becoming a captain, it was just an experience that Starfleet gave its cadets to better understand themselves and their new role.",
      "18": "The KM is a bit of a ridiculous scam. It’s supposed to be an unwinnable scenario. Its lesson is supposed to be psychological, a simulated experience of loss and defeat that is beneficial for the emotional development of officers. Except. It can’t be that. Every student who takes it can report on its scenarios to others, which means that if you go into the “test” naive about what it is, you just haven’t listened to others who already took it. Students would know what it was in advance and it cannot therefore have the effect it’s supposed to, since if you know the scenario in advance you aren’t really undergoing what it is claimed the test puts you through psychologically. A dead giveaway is the fact that Kirk could alter the scenario. He could only do that if he knew in advance what it was. And that’s even assuming that somehow the psychology of the situation is what it is said to be. I mean, you lose a simulation…how does that force you to have a cathartic epiphany about loss and mortality?\nAs a plot point, it’s just this preposterous device built into Star Trek II. A movie where Star Fleet officers with advanced sensor technology beam down to a planet they don’t even realize is the wrong one (when there’s no reason to beam down in the first place) and as dumb luck would have it, while they have an entire planet to land on, arrive at the one place where a small handful of resentful living prisoners happen to exist. And a movie where something called Genesis can create a planet out of a nebula cloud, without even the benefit of a star to orbit before it’s created.\nSo not the most carefully thought-out film.\n…",
      "19": "Data would probably employ the solution he did on his second match with Sirna Kolrami. In Peak Performance (Star Trek: The Next Generation) episode 47. In which the Starfleet Command is going to run a series of spot war games with just forty-eight hours warning to prepare an out of date ship against the Fleets flagship. Riker is tasked with the job of commanding the eighty year old USS Hathaway, and picks Data, Worf, Wesley Crusher, and Gorde La Forge, as his bridge command crew. They will be up against Picard and the ENTERPRISE-D. To oversee and Procter the game was the renowned Zakdorn strategist, Sirna Kolrami. He was considered a grand master of the game of Strategema. Riker challenges Kolrami to a game Strategema having no intention he would win but for the honour of having played the Grand Master. Data is goaded into challenging Kolrami as being an android he can't lose. Even so, Data loses despite being the odds on favorite. After this he feels he must be malfunctioning and has a crisis of conscience. He seeks out Picard to resign due to this failure. \"...Picard reminds him of his duty, and advises him \"It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.\" With his confidence now restored, Data returns to the bridge of the USS Hawthway. The war game proceeds and is won by Team Riker. After the war game is completed Data challenges Kolrami to another match. This time Data knows he can not win, but he can keep ramping up his responses until Kolrami can not keep up. At which point Kolrami quits in disgust. In the Kobayashi Maru test Data would understand it was a test of his metal at loosing his command, or saving it. By constantly upping his choices he would force the computer simulation to keep up with him until it declared a draw or the supervisor of the test called a halt to it.",
      "20": "For the last godsdamn time; you aren't SUPPOSED to beat the Kobayashi Maru scenario. The test isn't one of competency, or tactical ability, or diplomacy, or anything else like that.\nIt's a *no win* scenario. That's the point.\nThe purpose is to be a test of *character*, to see how the cadet reacts under the stress of command when called on to make a tough decision where there is *no* right answer and any decision they make… or a delay in that choice, is *going* to cost lives.",
      "21": "“Maintaining situational awareness and avoiding task saturation”\nEdit: Balence. See end\nIf you strike out once, do you stop playing the game or yell at the referee? When I was flying, I was often told from a tactical point of view, “Mistakes are human but don’t let a mistake turn into an error. Keep flying the airplane.” You hear the same thing in performance art. Make a mistake, keep going. Many might not notice but if you make a face…\nMany talk about the Kobayashi Maru like it’s a puzzle. As if there is this perfect solution. It’s a sim. The simulation will adapt to your particular choices.\nYou’re thrown a curve ball, do you keep going and work the problem or do you throw up your hands and give up?\n“Maintaining situational awareness and avoiding task saturation” is one technical way of putting it.\nLet’s remember, Savik passed the Kobayashi Maru test first time. After a failed attempt, Troi passed the Bridge Officer Examination . Crusher passed the psych eval on the first try. Kirk passed the Kobayashi Maru test three times.\nAustin Bugden\n· 1y\nDoes Captain Kirk ever learn from the Kobayashi Maru test?\nThat moment is shown in the video below. There was a reason Kirk was allowed to take the test three times. He performed fine, but “didn’t get the point”. They might of had to have give him a commendation to get him to stop asking. When I hear people talk about Koyayashi Maru many miss the point. I am reminded of a very smart friend of mine who in Officer training talked about how he was routinely publicly ripped apart because when folding his shirt in 8″ squares, they were never exactly 8″. When they see you learned the lesson, they let up. Some they don’t, but they won’t fail you because of a shirt. It was never about having a shirt folded in an 8″ square. They needed to see you can function with stress but not give up. Keep going. I agree in part with Kelli's answer. Kirk taught that lesson but didn’t really know it. Where i disagree with Kelli, ST:III, Kirk applies the lesson he learned. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. Spoiler. That moment, that realization, is shown below. Just as Kirk debriefed Savik in the first scene, David “debriefs” Kirk and allows David the last word in his realization. The “Koybashi Maru” test that was a huge portion of his life. He just didn’t know it until then.\nUnlike the 2009 Star Trek reboot I never thought Kirk “hacked the computer” Such a lazy interpretation for the “only genius level repeat offender in the Tri-State Area”. I’m sure the AI adapted to Kirk’s actions. I always imaged Kirk learned up on AI and “gamed the sim” like a chess game. Not unlike Captain Georgiou.\nOh Phillipa. Why you gotta be so mean?\nWhy do I think that? “Computer, this is a Class A directive”\nStar Trek Discovery: S4E01 Makes explicit the point. I won’t spoil it.\nIt was a fair treatment of the concept.",

He has no fears unless he chooses to activate his emotion chip. Even then, they are simulated fears that he can shut off. You and I cannot shut off adrenaline pumping through our veins, making our hearts beat faster.\nThe only one who really “passed” the test, as far as I’m concerned, is Sulu. He got the distress call from the Kobayashi Maru, realized it was on the other side of the neutral zone, and said, “Nope! We can’t cross the neutral zone.”\nAfter all, the Kobayashi Maru simulation is a hypothetical attempt by Romulans to sucker a Federation Starship into a compromising position, blow it up, and claim the whole thing as a pretext for war.\nSulu was having none of that.",

He doesn't get flustered, doesn't freeze and doesn't act irrationally.\nData would lose the engagement because that's inevitable but he would pass the test because of his good character.",
      "24": "I would say no, if you are speaking to “passing” as saving the the crew or the ship in distress. It is states in earlier Star Trek movies that is programed that no matter what your choices are you and your ship are destroyed. Programs will allow you limited choices which lead down a path in a seeming different direction, but they all lead to BOOM!.. A reverse decision tree….\nFor Kirk to win, as previously mentioned, he had to change the program. For Data to win he would have to study the code to find holes in the program ( bugs or glitches) which I doubt he has access to even if there were glitches…. as a programmer would probably code a fail safe of ‘ any out of the box command….. BOOM!’",
      "25": "Kobayashi Maru is not a pass/fail test, or even a win/lose one. … It’s a test to see which path you chose & why, and how you comport yourself in the process.\nImagine you are interviewing for a cooking position.

But a critical ingredient is missing. … So, the test is NOT whether you can make the dish, but how you react to not being able to do so.",
      "26": "So as to not bury the lead, yes Data could pass the Kobayashi Maru test. I’m not sure if this issue has ever been explored in books or any other expanded material. The Kobayashi Maru is not a skill test, it’s a test of character. However you run the test, you pass. If you enter the Neutral Zone to attempt to rescue the ship, you pass. If you ignore the distress call or attempt to contact the Klingons, continue on your patrol and obey the law, you pass.\nData doesn’t have character, per sé, he was programmed by Dr. Soong to have a sense of self, and a desire to better himself. On his own, Data had a personal desire to become more human. As arguably the apex of technology in the known galaxy (apart from Data’s “mother,” Dr. Juliana Tainer, Season 7 “Inheritance”), wanting to become more human seemed like a step down, or backwards, to some people (the Borg Queen, etc.). For seven seasons of television and 4 movies, this personal quest of Data’s was mined for material. Including in Nemesis, when he sacrificed himself to save his mentor and friend, Captain Picard.\nIf Data is emulating human behavior, compassion and willingness to help those in need, being important parts of the human condition, i believe Data would attempt to rescue the ship.\nSome great Data episodes are, in no particular order: S2 “The Measure of a Man,” S3 “Brothers,” S3 “The Offspring,” S3 “The Most Toys,” and previously mentioned S7 “Inheritance.”",

      "29": "Faced with the death of everyone on the Enterprise and the death of his captain as well as several other vessels, Data sacrifices himself. He could have found a way to destroy the scimitar and survive I think - the solution he chooses is similar to Janeway’s decision in Voyager. There was no other way to ensure everyone else to survive by his logic. This had the greatest chance of success. This was a real situation though and not the Kobayashi Maru.\nIf the Kobayashi Maru simulation is supposed to be a no-win situation, then the simulation isn’t meant to be hard or difficult. It’s meant to be impossible. It’s not a test of tactical ability, it’s a psychological test. The audience is there to watch someone taken down a peg and humbled, not to see if they can win. No matter what he did, the simulation would adapt I expect.",
      "30": "I’m gonna say no, or at least not conventionally.\nThe Kobayashi Maru doesn’t actually have a win condition. It spawns in enemies endlessly.\nYou can however, theoretically beat so many enemies that it’s more than the Klingons could plausibly send in, but this is technically not “winning”.",
      "31": "The novel “Kobayashi Maru” is really a set of short stories about the test, with a frame of Kirk, Scott, Sulu, and Chekov stranded in a drifting shuttlecraft and telling their tales, in which Chekov fights futilely. Kirk cheats, we know. Scott doesn’t even want command but he identifies a physical device which he can and does use in simulated combat but which didn’t work when it was tried for real… by him. At the same time, he wipes out more simulated Klingons than anyone else managed. The computer just sends in more Klingons. And Sulu tells the KM that he can’t carry out the rescue and won’t try, leading to temporary mutiny on his simulated bridge.\nI should say that being in a book means it didn’t “happen”.\nI would expect Data to decide as Sulu did there, that it can’t be done. To recognise this should count as a pass, although it may be asked whether the Academy means to teach cadets not to attempt the impossible. Maybe you are meant to do that only at the point of deciding to break rules, better to break the laws of physics than the Prime Directive.\nI think someone said that in one film it says that Data won the encounter, which is more like Scott or like Kirk.\nNovel “The Galactic Whirlpool”, out before “Star Trek II”, included another sneaky test for command-grade insight: you’re in a spacesuit driving a buggy on Earth’s moon. You get bug spots on your suit helmet. What do you do? You are not told this is a test, you just have a mission to drive somewhere. But calling for advice loses points. The spots are actually moon dust in an unusual state, electrically charged or something. Cadet Kirk stops, uses supplies to fit mudguards to the buggy, and drives on.\nIt seems that in real life, a lot of psychology tests and experiments are not testing you at the task you were given to do.\nMel Gilden’s novel “Boogeymen” gives Wesley Crusher the no longer practised KM test as an exercise on the Enterprise’s holodeck, with his childhood monster “Boogeymen” as enemy since Worf is his babysitter. Welsey is crushed, then it goes wrong and when they leave the holodeck, the Boogeymen are still pursuing them - it’s one of those fake exit stories.\nI think one of Jean Lorrah’s Data novels, “Survivors” and “Metamorphosis”, includes an important test for 24th century officers, and for Data. You’re on a holodeck, but your mind was altered to think it’s real. You’re on a mission gone bad on a planet that hasn’t contacted aliens, except for you being there secretly. Your team are captured and in danger and you have to decide whether to take action that could violate the Prime Directive. In fact, the correct conclusion is that you do not have enough information to decide.",

However, as the Kobayashi Maru is specifically designed to be a no-win scenario, it is unlikely that Data, or any other Starfleet cadet, would be able to pass it without violating the rules of the simulation.\nIn the Star Trek universe, the purpose of the Kobayashi Maru is to test a cadet's character and decision-making abilities in the face of a situation that cannot be solved through conventional means. The scenario involves a civilian ship, the Kobayashi Maru, being stranded in enemy territory, and the cadet must make a choice between rescuing the ship and violating the Federation's neutrality or abandoning the ship and leaving the crew to their fate.\nWhile Data's advanced computational abilities and lack of emotional bias may give him an edge in analyzing the situation and making the best decision, the outcome of the scenario is ultimately predetermined to be unwinnable. In Star Trek canon, only one person has ever \"beaten\" the Kobayashi Maru, and that was James T. Kirk, who famously reprogrammed the simulator to allow for a different outcome.\nTherefore, while Data may be able to perform exceptionally well in the scenario and impress his instructors, it is unlikely that he would be able to pass the Kobayashi Maru without violating the rules of the simulation or reprogramming the simulator itself.",

In the scenario, the prospective captain is in a situation where there appears to be a Federation civilian ship in the Neutral Zone, and it is asking for help. You need to determine whether or not to rescue the people, and how.\nSo what happens if you turn and run? That’s actually the logical thing to do; the ship is within the Neutral Zone, you can’t find it on your sensors, and the opposing power has cloaked ships. But it is likely that doing so is the only way to “lose.” If you go after the ship, you will end up outnumbered and outgunned, by a significant margin. Your choices are to surrender, abandon ship, or fight to the death. (I think fighting to the death is probably another way to lose.)\nData, when we first meet him at the start of TNG, is somewhat naive but looks mostly to logic. Most likely, he would follow the same path as Saavik in The Wrath of Khan, and end up abandoning ship. He would know the capabilities of his ship and the opposing ships, and would conclude that fighting is not going to work. He might keep the shields up inside the Neutral Zone, though, which might increase the survival time.\nBut, yes, I assume Data could pass the Kobayashi Maru, by facing a no-win scenario.",

Since it’s really designed to be a test of a person’s character, rather than actually just winning, I’m not sure Data would appreciate the subtle nuances of such a test.

It is famously known for being unwinnable, as its purpose is to assess how individuals handle failure and respond to difficult situations.\nAs an android and a highly advanced artificial intelligence, Data, from Star Trek: The Next Generation, possesses exceptional cognitive abilities, vast knowledge, and superior analytical skills. These traits would certainly give Data an advantage in facing the Kobayashi Maru simulation.\nHowever, passing the Kobayashi Maru does not mean finding a way to win the scenario outright. The test's purpose is to evaluate a cadet's ability to make difficult choices under extreme circumstances and to demonstrate their character and leadership qualities. The true measure of success in the Kobayashi Maru is not winning but rather how the cadet handles the no-win situation.\nData's logical thinking and capacity for objective decision-making could potentially allow him to navigate the test more effectively than others. He could employ his analytical abilities to assess the situation, identify the best course of action given the constraints, and execute it with precision. Data's lack of emotions might also help him remain calm and focused in the face of overwhelming odds.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the Kobayashi Maru is designed to challenge individuals on an emotional and psychological level, testing their resilience and ability to cope with failure. Data, despite his superior intellect, lacks emotions and the associated experiences that come with them. This aspect of his nature might be seen as a potential disadvantage since the test aims to evaluate emotional responses and moral decision-making as well.\nIn summary, while Data's exceptional abilities and logical thinking could enhance his performance in the Kobayashi Maru simulation, passing the test would still be a challenge.

      "48": "Data, an android in the Star Trek universe, might have an advantage in the Kobayashi Maru scenario due to his unique capabilities and lack of emotional bias. However, since this scenario is designed to be unwinnable, it's uncertain if even Data could pass it. In the Star Trek canon, James T.

Why do I think this?\nSaavik said she had not considered there could be a no-win scenario.\nWhen Wesley had his ‘psyche-test’ he was tricked into thinking there was an accident, even when he knew it was the day and time.\nWhen Troi took the Engineering test, where she had to order Geordi to his death, she was not expecting that.\nThere is a nicer (which I have not read) where characters relate their experiences.\nBut finally, cadets would certainly be put through various scenarios; it would defeat the purpose to tell them thus was the way.",

His “answers” were not as novel as Kirk's, but, due to his knowledge of engineering, created a level of “in-game” destruction of Klingon assets so as to push the Klingons to previously unheard of levels, including one method that while mathematically plausible, was empirically incorrect, which upset one admiral proctoring the exam with a background in engineering. Without giving away the punchline, Montgomery Scott's solution led to his transfer to the Engineering track."

It’s hard to tell without anything nearby for scale (except for blades of grass, which could be any size) but to me, this beasty looks to be about the size of a large dog. Maybe a bit longer in the torso, but not much taller or heavier.\nNope. They’re freakin’ huge!\nNow let’s be clear… tigers come in a wide array of sizes, and there’s a marked sexual dimorphism (meaning males are considerably larger than females). But still, the first time I saw a tiger in real life and up close, I was absolutely struck by how large they are. Even the head of an adult male tiger is about as big as a male human’s torso.\nSo yeah. Tigers are big kitties.",

More like a Border collie.\nI was also very surprised to find out a few days ago that the bigfin squid, which I had also assumed to be about cat sized, is about 30ft long with a body the size of a human torso.\nOn the other hand the duck-billed platypus, which looks as if it ought to be beaver-sized, is only about as big as a large brown rat.",

The lion that I saw was the size of a small pony. He was huge. I have seen polar bears swimming in a pool with an under water observation window, and they are enormous. Seeing them on TV simply doesn’t do any justice to how big they actually are. Getting up close to a giraffe will also add new information to your definition of tall. I remember the circus coming to town when I was a little boy in Chicago and I saw the elephants parading down the street. They appeared to be as big as a bus.

The wolf and tiger examples are good. But when you have a healthy wild animal, eating well, in a healthy environment, they can be even bigger than the domestic ones because of the superior muscular development. A zoo/preserve animal in a large natural enclosure can approach the max size that genetics allows while that doesn’t happen as much in the wild.\nMy answer: I was surprised when I saw a black mamba in the wild.

    "title": "If India has higher soft power than China then why are foreigners more interested in learning Chinese rather than the Indian language",
    "answers": {
      "1": "As a foreigner who learned Chinese I can tell you the exact reason.\nI was very interested in learning Hindi, in fact I purchased a book and asked a buddy to tutor me in it. But then I realized something kind of depressing.\nAccording to this English proficiency index, India has among the best English speakers in Asia. This is pretty true as I know plenty of foreigners who have travelled to India(both on business and vacation) and gotten by just fine only knowing English.\nWhat’s more each region in India has a different language, I didn’t have time to learn 10 languages. In absolute terms I could reach more people with Mandarin Chinese than with any single Indian language. In fact I would need to learn Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, and Punjabi to reach the same number of people as Mandarin Chinese. Let’s see…learn 4 languages, or learn 1….hmmm….\nIt seems the Indians also asked themselves this question because English and Hindi are both given status in the government, and English(according to the BBC article below) is the sole lingua franca of India. I already know English, so I’m not going to learn a whole new language just to speak English all the time.\nEnglish or Hinglish - which will India choose? - BBC News\nBusiness in India is conducted in English most of the time, so what good would Hindi do for me? In a work group I might have a Tamil speaker, a Marathi speaker, a Hindi speaker, and a Punjabi speaker. Rather than having everyone learn 4 languages, we would all communicate in English. Therefore I don’t need to learn an Indian language.\nIn China it doesn’t work that way. Business is conducted largely in Chinese, in fact the only time English is involved is when you are dealing with a foreign company. If you have a room full of Chinese people, they will speak Chinese. In India though you could see a room full of Indian people speaking English to each other.\nI want to learn an Indian language, but they aren’t exactly easy languages, and I find it hard to motivate myself to do it when it isn’t necessary. I could learn Hindi, a language made almost obsolete by English in India, or I could learn Russian, a language necessary to doing business across Eastern Europe and Asia. When it comes to usefulness Indian languages aren’t incredibly high on the list of most useful languages.",
      "2": "One word: usefulness.\nThe majority of foreign citizens aren’t going to speak to rural Indians living in India’s interior. They’ll more likely speak to India’s urban population…\n…with whom English is certainly more useful than any Indian language.\nChinese is, however, very useful if you wat to go to China, because not as many people speak English at all.\nPut simply, too many people speak English in India too well for Hindi or Bengali or Kannada to be useful to a foreign individual. So the foreign individual chooses not to learn Hindi or Bengali or Kannada, because it isn’t worth it- English will do. Heck, for certain Indians raised in English (moi, for instance), English is the preferred language. Why go to any lengths to learn a very difficult language you will likely not use in India if you’re a foreign citizen?",
      "3": "Isn’t it obvious that in current circumstances they will be more inclined to learn Chinese? Well to name few prominent ones:\nChina is the largest economy(in terms of ppp) with a pretty high growth rate\nEase of doing business is better in China\nMore professionalism\nOnly single language required\nTo work in India you don’t need any Indian language, English will do",
      "4": "Indeed Bollywood movies and entertainment and Yoga have higher popularity abroad, even Chinese are attracted by them, but language learning is majorly motivated by economic benefits, not by cultural interests.\nApparently Mainland China and Taiwan have larger economy share than Hindustan(India+Pakistan)There are more job/business/academic/institutional opportunities. That’s no wonder more people are learning Mandarin than Hindustani(Hindi+Urdu) . For instance, Ivanka Trump’s daughter and Jim Rogers’ daughter are taking Mandarin courses. Mark Zuckerberg speaks Mandarin partially because he married a Chinese descent.\nOne interesting thing to note is that Cantonese, another Chinese tongue only officially spoken in China’s Hong Kong and Macau SARs, are always among one of the first batch of languages in almost all popular apps/ softwares/ phones. That explains how consumption power matters. For instance, Apple’s Siri supports Cantonese from iOS version 6.0 and above but English( India) only started since version 8.3. Hindustani is still missing.\nSo here comes another issue-English is more widely spoken in India than any native language. That will reduce the motivation for foreign businesses/ persons to adopt an Indian language.\nThere was news about India trying to promote Hindi as an official language of the UN. I remember comments complaining it was a waste of taxpayers money and it could be used to reduce poverty and it was not fair for other Indian languages and so on.\nThough it is not necessarily a bad thing. Unity in diversity rather than homogeneity at the cost of sacrifice local culture is preferable. As well knowing English is a great advantage on today’s international arena.\nForeigners don’t need to learn a local language when English is the most powerful one.",
      "5": "I'm a proud Indian and I feel I must answer this question.\nFirst of all, it isn't 'the Indian language’. There is no such language called 'Indian' so I think foreigners have to correct themselves there because it really ticks off Indians.\nNext, India has nearly 22 official languages. Each state has a different official language so it obviously doesn't make sense that a foreigner learn all these 22 languages to survive in India.\nIndia has a total of 121 languages, spoken in 19,500 dialects according to census.\nIndia is a country of huge diversity. Most widely spoken languages in India are English and Hindi. If you know these two languages, you definitely can survive in India.\nBesides, Indians speak the best English in Asia and that's probably why foreigners don't find the need to learn Indian languages.\nI hope this answer helps.",
      "6": "India is a complex country with diversity oozing out from all its aspects. It has around 24 nationally recognized languages, besides thousands other languages or dialects. The national recognition means that any central government laws, rules, regulations or any other type of govt communications have to be translated in these 24 languages and anyone can demand it.\nEnglish being the language of last colonial rulers, it had achieved the status of official language. Besides, adoption of English has also prevented linguistic conflicts that is ever present in a country like India.\nHowever, it would be wrong to say India does not have a language that could be of used as a single national language.\nSanskrit is the language that is underlying originator of most prominent of Indian languages, it is also the language of original religious texts of Hindu religion. I don't think there could have been much resistance had it was adopted as a national language in formative years of Indian Independence.\nHowever, it was much more simple to adopt English on account accustomed comfort of Indian elites and bureaucracy. Apart from that , acceptability of English as medium of higher education internationally also played it part, absorption of latest in science and technology was much easier in English, as whole ecosystem was serviced by it.\nThe other basic difference being the nature of its polity, being democracy, India most of the time end up in choosing path of least resistance, so the case of English.\nThere are other factors as well;\nChina because of its communism can drive change forcefully without appeasing anyone in the process, resulting decisions much more logical, irrespective of its suitability. Historically also many emperors of China focused on having a single simplified Chinese language for their people, completely disregarding diversity and emotions of its people. The sinicization process was also undertaken to maintain single identity of the Chinese nation, you will also find very few or none, examples of republics in China. On the other hand, India was replete with republic, kingdoms or other form of governing structures, retaining individual identity is supremely prized.",
      "7": "I think they are two separate things. Indians’ strength in soft power comes about because their educational language is English. there are a huge number of languages used in India, but the official communication language is still English, especially among software designers. While in China, the main language of communication still remains as Mandarin.",
      "8": "because majority of people can speak English in India. Foreigners who can speak English well can easily communicate in India . The case is not similar in China.\nMajority of people of China can not communicate in English. So if a person visiting China either for business or tourism need to learn mandarin.\nsecondly, a foreigner coming to India has to decide and choose which language s/he should learn. India has several Languages like Tamil, Telugu, kanadda, Malayalam, Marathi, Konkani, Bengali, Odia, Nepali, Hindi, Kashmiri, naga and more and more. Is it possible for a person to learn all of the Major languages spoken in India who wants to visit India …",
      "9": "There's no evidence to support the conclusion: “India has higher soft power”, this is people's delusion.\nI don’t know how did you define “SOFT Power”, but I think the economic activities is the biggest movitation to learn a language. Economic statistics will give you some ideas, because money talks.This is the world GDP ranking, china is 5 times more than India with almost same size of population.\nBeside the GDP, china is also the largest importing and exporting country in the world, which tell the truth is: if you wanna make better bussiness, just learn chinese language, in comparison to india, india did a little in exporting and imporing part.Which tells you the reality, at least in the bussiness sector, chinese language values more.\nThen, let’s see the tourism part.\nAccording to wikipedia, china’s tourist arrival ranks 4th in the world, with 58 millions arrival, at 2015, meanwhile India is not even in the world top 10, only 8 million tourists arrivals.\nlet’s see the numbers of international student.\nNone of above statistics proves “india has more soft power compare to china”. China and india are not even close in “soft powers”. Language is a tool of communication to help the understanding of each other, without motivative activities such as trading,studying and tourism, there’s no need to learn another language.\nDon’t even mention that there are more than 5 or 6 major languages in india, but china only use madarin as official language.\nSo, the truth is, becuase china has much stronger soft power, then much more people choose to learn chinese instead of indian language.",
      "10": "Well, it is obvious that India is not too keen about promoting its own language in the world, whereas the Chinese don't seem to be afflicted with such apathy. Consider, also, that Chinese is far more difficult than Hindi or any Indian language. Indian languages do not have a particular cultural or economic salience in modern India that would draw business-oriented foreign language learners to them.\nMost Indians themselves would actively discourage you from learning Hindi, particularly those who are in business and tech.",
      "11": "In India one can survive with the knowledge of English. Of course, our accent and dialect may be a bit hard to get used to. Indians can understand any accent of English (different accents in USA, UK, Australia, etc. ). So, just speak slowly and be patient when listening.\nThat said, Hindi is not a link language. It is not required for business. In the IT sector, members of a team come from diverse backgrounds and have different mother tongue. English is the safest best.",
      "12": "Dear Friends, India is a land of diversity …… different states are culturally different from each other, their food habit are different.. For example in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, UP, Bihar and in some other states there are mejority vegetarians… Kerala, Goa, Odisha and in coastal parts people like sea food …… Bengal, Assam they prefer fish from sweet water…..\nNow coming to the diversity in language, there are 22 official languages and more than 1000 local languages…. which language a foreigner will learn??\nBut interestingly most of the Indians can speak/ understand Hindi and English. In every official form there is Hindi and English alternative….. every sign board there are three languages displayed (official state language, Hindi and English)…. So if any foreigner knows English then it is good enough to survive in India…. probably India is the second highest English speaking country after US.\nBut in China, though there are more population than India but only one official language. English is not very popular there. So, to communicate with Chinese people most of the time it is required know Chinese language.",
      "13": "I always think soft power is based on hard power. Am I wrong?",
      "14": "India has higher soft power than China,\nNot necessarily. It really depends on your target audience.\nFor East Asians, the influence of India’s soft power is not comparable to China’s. The reverse is true for South Asians. For non-Asian people, what you probably would get is similar amounts of people who want to learn Chinese, and those who want to learn the Indian languages, which brings us to my next argument:\nThere are too many “Indian languages”, and none of them are exactly dominant even within India’s borders (Hindi is bordering being dominant in some degree with over 400 million native speakers, but still only spoken by less than 60% of the entire Indian population) which make none of them comparatively influential as Mandarin Chinese, or even Cantonese (120 million native speakers).\nFinally, there is the language with even more “soft power”: English. And unfortunately for advocates for the use of Indian languages, there are simply “too many” Indians that can and are willing to speak English, although this can be a major advantage in various other fields (such as IT outsourcing).\nThink about it:\nIf you are given the choice to learn 1 or 2 languages to cover 98% of a population of 1.4 billion people, or to learn at least 6 or more languages to cover ~85% of a similarly big population, what would be your decision?\nWhat if you also happen to speak another language (possibly your mother tongue - English), that is also spoken by at least 12% (highly likely to be middle class or higher class people) of the latter?",
      "15": "Because India has so, so many languages.\nAccording to Wikipedia\n, India has 122 languages with more than 10,000 native speakers, and 30 which are spoken by over a million. Simply put, nobody can learn even a fraction of those languages.\nChina does have the advantage in this regard, since Mandarin is widely spoken, and subsets such as Cantonese are comprehensible to those that learn it. It’s quite similar to how German is different in Austria and Germany.\nBut India, in its diversity, has this as a very big weakness. Even natives may struggle to communicate with others in they go to the next province over. Hindi, by far the largest language, is spoken by less than 2 out of 5 Indians. English is in 2nd, though its mostly a second language spoken by the nations intellectuals.\nIndia has to fix this problem. While language is a beautiful thing, it simply becomes frustrating for natives and foreigners who might learn Hindi to then go to the South and try and comprehend Tamil. If India wishes to fix this problem, they need to try and make one or two languages widespread. Personally, I think English would work quite well. Generally, it’s the second most spoken language in any one location, it’s the most widespread language globally, and learning the grammar is relatively easy (it mostly comes down to memorizing the many, many, many unique nouns).\nIndia is an amazing country, but for it to really shine, it needs a ‘lingua franca’.",

      "17": "1. HOW MANY LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN IN CHINA\nChinese Language Day is the 20th April\n. It’s a time chosen to fit in with the Chinese celebration of Guyu, which honours Cangjie – the four-eyed mythical figure who is traditionally understood to have created Chinese characters in the time of the Yellow Emperor, around 5000 years ago…\nWhat is the language of China?\nMandarin is the most-spoken language in the world, with approximately 1.2 billion speakers. When most people think of “Chinese”, it is Mandarin that they are picturing. But Mandarin Chinese is far from the only variant of the Chinese language – or the only language spoken in China…\nIn fact, there are a great number of Chinese languages. These include eight primary spoken dialects within mainland China\nMandarin\nAlso known as Putonghua or “common tongue”, Mandarin has been the official language of Chinasince 1913 and all schools in China are supposed to teach in Mandarin (even if some don’t). Thus, it can be heard across the country. You will generally find that most Chinese people will speak at least a little Mandarin, even if it is only some basics with a strong accent.\nStandard Mandarin is based on the original Beijing dialect of Chinese. But there are many dialects within Mandarin, with speakers of each usually focussed around major cities such as Tianjin or Shenyang.\nGan\nIn many western parts of China, you will hear the Gan dialect being spoken. Jiangxi province is the main centre for speakers of Gan, as are nearby regions such as Anhui, Fujian, Hubei and Hunan.\nHakka (Kejia)\nThe Hakka dialect is the closest to Gan – to the point where one is sometimes termed a variety of the other.

      "18": "Your question presumed India has higher soft power than China, the truth is, that presumption is incorrect.\nFirst of all, soft power also involve power projection and their audience. Indian’s sphere of influence is in South Asia, while China's sphere of influence is in East Asia.\nGuess what, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore etc are all populous/prosperous regions that have a role internationally. And to an extent they are all heavily influenced by the Chinese culture. South Asia, in contrast…. Honestly, most people will have a hard time even naming a few countries from South Asia. Yes sure, people in Bhutan will likely learn one of the many, many Indian languages as their second language, where Koreans will more likely choose to learn Mandarin. And let's be real here, Korea has more influence than Bhutan internationally.\nOne reason why the western soft power dominated the whole world was not because their history and culture was THAT much superior, it was because they had a greater power projection of their influences, often via military means. You Indians learned English not because you loved the language and culture so much, it was because the British slapped it in your face.\nNext, most Indians bragged about Bollywood, yoga, and Buddhism when talking about Indians soft power. But let's face it. Buddhism? How many of you still practice that? Wikipedia says 0.7%. It's like saying Catholic and Christianity is Arab because Jesus was Hebrew. Yes, the soft power of Buddhism originated from India, but the power projecting part was really done by the Chinese. The modern day Buddhism and the Zen philosophy are mostly developed by the Chinese. Nowadays, when people think about Buddhism, they think about East Asian rather than Indian. Just like when people think about Christianity, they think about Europeans, not Arabs.\nBollywood? Yea I know it's the second largest after Hollywood. But is being large equals to being influential? I know Chinese had produced superstars like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li etc. The Chinese cinema had immense influence on the establishment of modern MMA and the action movie genre. I'm not sure if any Indian stars became a household name around the world on the level of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. I honestly don't think so. And even if so, what genre did they had an influence on? Belly dance?\nIndians brag about yoga, the exercise, meditation and the philosophy. China has something similar in Taichi, kungfu, and the yinyang philosophy behind it, but I do think yoga is more popular worldwide. Buuuut, if we are talking about a broader sense of health, wellness, exercise, workout etc, China is leagues ahead of India. We are consistently top 3 in the Olympics, we have complete domination in some sports such as ping pong, where we even export talents and coaches. India, the second largest population in earth with 1.4 billion people, can't even get a gold medal in the last Olympics.\nI'm not even gonna go into the economies and businesses side of the soft power. But let's face it, China has more soft power, and more soft power projection than India. Period.",
      "19": "India does NOT have more soft power than China. I don’t know where people get this idea from. It sounds like wishful thinking. The Lowy Institute found that China scored consistently better in soft power than India did.\nGenerally non-Indian people do not fear or admire India….they just don’t think about India much at all… Even though India is soon to become the most populous country in the world. Most people just don’t really view India as a “great power”. Bollywood movies are really not that popular in the West, Indian cuisine is not as popular as Chinese cuisine is around the world, and India’s democracy is far too chaotic to be appealing to other countries. 🤦‍♀️\nBoth China and India persecute their Muslim minorities but India’s actions towards its Muslim population is seen far more negatively in actual Muslim majority nations like the Arab Gulf states. This is because India’s Islamophobia is apparent in both the government institutions and general Hindu majority public. Ordinary Hindu Indians are committing violent hate crimes against Muslim Indians at an alarming rate while the average Chinese citizen is nowhere near as anti-Muslim. I think this is mostly because China’s history with Islam isn’t as messy as India’s relationship to it, and most Chinese people do not care much about religion.\nSoutheast Asia was historically heavily influenced by India and most Southeast Asians do not like China, but Southeast Asians in general dislike Indian people a lot more than they do Chinese people. India is economically a lot worse off than many Southeast Asian nations. India’s GDP per capita is only slightly better than the poorest SEA country of Myanmar. The strong preference for light skin in Southeast Asia also makes Southeast Asians think of Indians as racially inferior. What’s ironic is that India also has a traditional preference for light skin and Indian cultural influence actually played a major role in the development of this beauty standard in Southeast Asia. Well…I guess that backfired horribly. 😐\nAs for why more people learn Chinese then it’s mostly because “Indian” isn’t a language while “Chinese” is officially Standard Mandarin in the PRC. Many Indians can already speak English and India is too linguistically heterogenous for Hindi to be as useful as Mandarin is in China. I also think because China is East Asian (arguably the East Asian country lmfao), there’s a lot of fetishization of its people (particularly the women who are seen as inferior but desirable) and culture among Westerners which exists in conjunction with the fearmongering and hatred of it. South Asian countries are simply not Orientalized in the same way as East Asian ones are.\nEven if China remained brutally poor, there would STILL be a lot of people in the West interested in China (like them Pearl S. Buck types) because the exotification of China through the Western lens goes back centuries.",
      "20": "Because the official language in India is english.",
      "21": "I’ll answer simply.\nThere are more Mandarin speakers, China has a bigger population\nIn India there are so many Indian languages, and then so many dialects.. difficult to wade through them.\nMost of us speak English, so people don't have to necessarily know an Indian langauge to communicate with us\nChina is more of an economic hub I believe. More expats there? Plus it has more world power",
      "22": "What if I told you there are people in foreign countries who make their living by singing Bollywood songs in concerts in their native countries? You wont believe me right? You may assume that they didn’t find any stable job in their country and so they just live hand to mouth by singing Hindi songs?\nWhat if I told you many such people have studied in Delhi University where they trained in Indian classical singing, Indian classical dance forms, learnt how to dress in Indian costumes like Sari, Salwar suit, etc and they use those learnings to give a real Indian vibe while performing in concerts in their country?\nI know you wont believe till I give you few examples. I will give just two.\nFirst one is the singer with angel like voice and beauty, Ms Nozia Karomatulloh from Tajikistan. Her dad is also a legendary singer of Hindi songs.\nThe second example I will give, has engaged his entire family in the profession of singing Hindi songs. As on 2022, he is performing back to back live concerts in India in cities like Pune, New Delhi, Noida, etc. He is Mr Hawas Guruhi from Uzbekistan.\nThere are many such examples of foreigners who has a thriving career built on Indian art performance. Definitely India has huge soft power atleast in Central Asia.",
      "23": "In karnataka the state language is kannada which is understood by most of the people there, but my mother tongue is Tulu which is spoken by majority of people in coastal karnataka. There are other languages like konkani etc. Tulu, Konkani, Kannada have different dialects depending on the region and the caste of the people. Sometimes we can't understand Kannada spoken by people from northern districts. So in total I have to learn Tulu, Kannada, Hindi and English to be able to connect with all the people and I have to be able to understand even Konkani and sometimes Urdu.\nSo if this is the case of one state in India. Imagine how many languages and dialects exist in 29 different states. Indians speak in English so that everyone could understand their opinions despite the difference in their mother tongue.\nWhere as China has only one language which is widely used i.e, Mandarin.Chinese is widely used in China as the main language for communication as well as business.\nSo it is logical to learn one language instead of 10 languages cause most Indians are fluent in English. But majority of Indians would probably not understand Hindi or any other Indian language.",
      "24": "Mandarin is popular for more than one reason. One reason is that Mandarin is the official language of China, which has more than 1.4 billion people and is the second-largest economy in the world. As China becomes more important on the world stage, it becomes more important to be able to talk to its people.\nAlso, Mandarin is a language that isn't too hard to learn. And because China's economy is doing so well, there are more chances than ever for people from other countries to do business there.\nSo, Mandarin Chinese is an excellent choice if you want to learn a second language. It will give you an edge in business and let you connect with one of the most populous and fastest-growing countries in the world.",

      "26": "There are several reasons why foreigners might be more interested in learning Chinese rather than the Indian language:\nGlobal Economic Influence: China's rapid economic growth and status as the world's second-largest economy have led to increased business and trade opportunities.\nPopularity of Mandarin: Mandarin Chinese, the official language of China, is the most widely spoken language globally.\nCultural Appeal: Chinese culture, including its rich history, philosophy, and traditions, has captivated the global imagination.\nGlobal Media Presence: China has made significant investments in expanding its media reach globally through platforms like CCTV and Xinhua News.\nIndian Language Diversity: India boasts a wide array of languages and dialects, making it challenging for foreigners to choose a specific Indian language to learn. India has 120+ major languages and 1500+ other languages.\nLimited Indian Government Initiatives: While China has actively promoted the teaching of Chinese worldwide through its Confucius Institutes, India's g...",
      "27": "To instruct Chinese labourers.\nChina is known as factory of the world and is the leading manufacturing hub of the world. The CCP run Chinese government gives land at subidized rates to factory investors. They also give investors free water and electricity for their new factories. They also have huge blue collar workforce.\nThe main design of the products take place in the investors’ home country. The engineering, IP, etc are all done in the west. The labour is dirt cheap in China. They can recover the cost of setting up the factory in few months by selling the product at thrice the price than manufacturing cost. It would have costed these western companies ten times more to manufacture the same quality and scale of products back in their own country where their parent company is located.\nThe westerners who are mainly the investors and visiting engineers, scientitsts, markters, etc earn twenty times higher salaries at par with cost of living back home than their Chinese labourers. If they leave the day to day affair of managing the factory to some local Chinese MBA then there is Chance of mutiny against the white people exploiting poor regime. But if the westerners can employ one of their own people who has poor job opportunities back home, they will ensure everything in their capacity to exploit scalibility from the Chinese labouerers.\nIndia has large section of workforce as well. But we are educated and only go for white collar careers. Most of us work in tech sector of India. Our salaries are at par with western engineers and managers now. The official business language in Indian is English. They can communicate their business problems to us in English and we also check whether we are fairly compensated.",

I was surprised in a professional setting, everyone and I mean everyone spoke English. I had no issues at all. I went there a few times after for work and felt comfortable speaking to locals and some of them even became my friends. Similarly I went to China for work as well between 2007 and 2018. Only about one in five spoke English that I could understood. Although they were super nice and good drinkers, they were always reserved. I chalked it to either the political system or language barrier. I can imagine a lot of people who do more business in China wanting to learn Chinese to be ...",

So at the end to impress chinese people are learning mandarin.",
      "33": "John Garrison answers your question very well. However, I'd like to point out that the connection between a country's soft power and learning the popularity of their language isn't as obvious as it might seem. It's more because of the approach of the two countries.\nChina has always had a mindset of forcing the world into accepting what they believe in - be it territorial claims, traditional medicine, way of governance, etc. India is more of a “live and let live” kind of a country.\nIndia and China, both have global ambitions but the way they go about it is very different. China won't promote English in their country but rather make the whole world speak Chinese instead. That's how they do business. They have their conditions and one of them is around the language. India is more flexible, has always been. China's approach has its benefits though, as Chinese language is spreading across the world whereas regional Indian languages are going extinct.\nAlthough I don't believe the major Indian languages will ever die but the fact is, it might seem like people learn Chinese because of China's “soft power\" but digging deeper would reveal a different reason.",

    "title": "What do real WW2 Nazis think about Holocaust deniers",
    "answers": {
      "1": "After the Second World War over a thousand Nazis and other Europeans were tried for crimes associated with the operation of the network of concentration camps scattered throughout Germany, Poland and other occupied countries. The following figures are entirely typical : Nuremberg Trial - 24 defendants, 19 convicted, 10 executed, 1 suicide (Hermann Goring) and 1 tried and sentenced to death in absentia (Martin Borman). Auschwitz trial - 40 tried, 1 acquitted, 18 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, 21 executed. Dachau - 40 tried, 35 executed. Matthausen, 61 tried, 58 executed. Buchenwald, 31 tried, 22 executed, 9 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Majdanek - 63 tried, 7 executed, 56 sentenced to long terms of imprionment. Ravensbruck - 39 tried, 17 executed, 15 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, 3 died in custody, 4 acquitted. Muhdorf … need I go on?\nMake no mistake, those on trial were fighting for their lives.\nSo, various defences were presented by those on trial. The vast, vast majority stated that they were simply obeying orders, that to have refused to participate in the killings would have meant a court martial and almost inevitable execution. The defendants at the Sobibor trial presented a joint defence to that effect : that once they arrived at a death camp they could not refuse their orders, quoting one of their officers, Sturmbanfuhrer Christian Wirth : “If you do not like it here, you can leave, but under the earth, not over it.\" This defence was almost universally rejected.\nA smaller but still significant number claimed they were assigned to minor and insignificant roles in the camps and did not know that mass exterminations were taking place. This was also rejected, mainly on the grounds that the military would have no place for blind and deaf people.\nIt is almost beyond belief but a small minority of those on trial defended themselves on the grounds that their actions were not illegal and were entirely justifiable. Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz and Birkenau for most of the time the camps were in operation, was one of them. It didn’t work and he was hanged in 1947. Auschwitz physician Fritz Klein baldly stated that “Out of respect for human life, I would remove a purulent appendix from a diseased body. The Jews are the purulent appendix in the body of Europe.” Klein was hanged in 1945.\nOkay. Now, holocaust deniers, please explain this - of the thousands of men and women who were accused of committing war crimes associated with the Holocaust not one - not one - attempted to defend themselves on the grounds that the Holocaust did not take place and was in fact a hoax perpetrated by the victorious allies as a particularly nasty propaganda exercise.\nNot one.\nNow, don’t you think that, standing on the scaffold with a noose around their neck, the condemned man (or woman, they were hanged too) would look the Holocaust denier straight in the eye and say “Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?!”",
      "2": "Oskar Groning was what nobody wants to be, a guard at Auschwitz. His primary job was sorting and valuables new arrivals turned over. A big source of income for the Third Reich was the valuables prisoners handed over.\nWhen the war ended Oskar wasn’t brought up on charges. He was captured before the war ended, did some time in a British POW camp, and when the war ended he went home to his wife.\nUpon seeing his wife again she asked about his experiences and he said “Girl, do both of us a favour: don't ask” and she left it there. One day a while later someone made an offhand joke that Oskar could actually be a killer given his time at Auschwitz. He banged on the table and demanded that nobody ever mention Auschwitz again or he would leave.\nOskar wanted to put what he had done behind him. He was a devout Nazi, an Auschwitz camp guard no less, and he wanted this to remain a secret.\nOskar got a job at a glass factory and worked his way up into a management role. He worked there for decades and lived a very normal life. Oskar collected stamps and was even a judge.\n\nIn 1985 Oskar met a Holocaust denier and was given a pamphlet on Holocaust denial. Shocked that such a thing exists, Oskar came forward to dispute it. He made multiple statements and gave a full account of what he had seen.\n\n> I saw everything. The gas chambers, the cremations, the selection process. One and a half million Jews were murdered in A...",
      "3": "The thing is, holocaust denial is a crime. If a German citizen questioned the specific details of any aspect of the holocaust, they could be arrested. Since a lawyer was arrested for representing a holocaust denier, I don’t think they’re capable of giving them a fair trial. Also, there’s German soldiers who served honorably in the war (in America soldiers often serve honorably in a war, even if they don’t agree with it such as Vietnam and Iraq), those who worked in the camp (nobody wanted to be there), those who voted for Nazi’s (about 90%), those who were official party members (about 20%.) There have been countless movies about the horrors of the holocaust, yet very few tell how horrific it was under soviet control after the war. Soviet soldiers were instructed to ‘rid these women of their German pride’ and they proceeded to rape women 8–80, not once; but over and over again.\nThe best way to fight bad speech is with more speech. If you ban something, you make it taboo to someone; even if only 1. Banning ‘holocaust denial’ is foolish, they should simply allow people to collect evidence and make their argument. Then someone with evidence contrary to theirs can question it and argue against it. Most would not bother and simply put all of the evidence to the holocaust in 1 spot and just cite that source.",
      "4": "Given that the vast majority of actual Nazis from World War II are no longer alive to offer their opinions on Holocaust deniers, it is difficult to give a firm answer to this question. However, it is likely that they would not have had much respect for Holocaust denialists given the Nazi regime's ideology and beliefs.\nRacism, totalitarianism, and anti-Semitism formed the basis of the Nazi regime. Six million Jews and millions of other people of colour were killed systematically during the Holocaust, which was a key component of Nazi ideology and was carried out with the leadership's full knowledge and approval. It would have been viewed as undermining the legitimacy and achievements of the Nazi regime to deny the Holocaust.\nIn addition, many Nazis took pride in their part in the Holocaust and saw it as a necessary and legitimate action in their struggle for a society that was racially pure. It would have been considered a betrayal of this ideology and an insult to the sacrifices made by Nazi soldiers and supporters to deny or downplay the Holocaust.\nConclusion\nI believe It's also important to remember that groups on the far right and neo-Nazis who assert to be influenced by Nazi ideology are frequently linked to Holocaust denial. To be clear, these organizations may be seen as distortions or perversions of the original Nazi ideology rather than representing the beliefs or opinions of actual Nazis from World War II.",
      "5": "My first German teacher was from Regensburg. Her husband was in the Luftwaffe and killed in WW2. Later, she moved to the USA.\nShe said she had NO IDEA that death camps existed. Sure, there were prisons and trouble makers and she asked “How many of YOU know what is going on a XXX prison?” Admittedly, none did.\nI have visited the death camps and have a different view. Not many are as lucky.",
      "6": "I’ve made this observation before, but I believe it to be appropriate here: The standards and expectations of behaviour that we apply to human rights, tolerance and acceptance of cultural minority groups, are far higher today than in the 1920s in Europe.\nThe genocidal paranoia of Hitler’s Mein Kampf - which informed his political speeches and subsequent policies when in power - were not universally seen as abnormal. In other words, the person in the street was far more likely, in 1920s Germany, to agree with those sentiments.\nHaving established this mindset, putting those policies into action is but a short step away. What, today, we would see as depravity and brutality, had already been rationalised by the individuals concerned. Political indoctrination was easy when the seed was planted in such fertile soil.\nAnd the demonstration effect of the prosperity the Nazis created - deliberately linked to the disenfranchisement of the Jews - set this viewpoint in place as a community norm. Because your neighbour joined the Nazi party, it was not only OK, but expected, for you to follow suit.\nSo the issue then becomes, not ‘How aware of the Holocaust were people ?’ It’s more like, ‘How accepting of it were they?’ And in that context, I’d guess that their opinion of Holocaust deniers would be pretty low. Contemptuous, even.",

This article discusses some of range of opinion seen within them.\nThe last living WWII-era German Nazis have shockingly few regrets\nIn a the new documentary \"Final Account,\" filmmaker Luke Holland — whose grandparents were killed in the Holocaust — interviewed a number of former Nazis who are living comfortably in Germany.\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/05/19/the-last-living-wwii-era-german-nazis-have-shockingly-few-regrets/\nplease keep in mind:open identification with the Nazi party can still have serious ramifications in Germany. Many of those involved are less than candid about their real feelings.\nThere were WW II era Nazis that attempted to downplay or minimize the holocaust. That seems largely like a knee jerk reaction.\nthis interview serves as a prominent example.\nDr. Martin Sandberger\nThis is a 1991 interview done in Stuttgart with Dr. Martin Sandberger, former member of the SS and head of various departments for internal security, including the Sonderkommando 1a of Einsatzgruppe A, as well as the Sicherheitspolizei and SD. [Above: Dr. Martin Sandberger in Allied captivity] Dr. thank you for meeting with me, I would like to ask you some questions regarding what you experienced during the Third Reich and the war. I understand you were in the SS, how did you choose this branch of service? Dr. Sandberger: I am afraid the SS chose me, instead of me choosing the SS. I was an early member of the NSDAP and supporter of the F�hrer. I joined the SA while in university, but my primary focus was to obtain my degree, politics came second. Because my family was a social family, we knew many people, some in very high positions or stations if you will. When it became clear that we would win the election as the leaders of Germany, I started to look for ways to fit in. Friends and acquaintances started to use my name around RF Himmler who asked to meet with me. We had lunch in Berlin, and he laid out his vision for Germany, and his personal beliefs about religion and the SS. I was very impressed with his intellect, and his vision for a healthy, productive, and idealistic society. I agreed to accept assignment in the Allgemeine SS, working with the legal side of national security. I earned my SS dagger, promotions, and held many offices and ranks. Wearing the black uniform was a symbol of elite status in the new government. Being a SS man gave one discounts with party affiliated stores, good food, and top-notch medical care. My family was well taken care of, and I had no worries in the world. Life was good with no angst and the SS was a very professional business organization. The SS stands labeled as a criminal organization at Nurnberg do you support this judgement. Dr. Sandberger: No, Nurnberg was a legal farce as are all the trials regarding how we conducted the war. They tried us by a standard that was illegal and against all laws that the west was founded on. The Allies made up charges for deeds that were not crimes until May 1945. They practiced the same actions the Reich did, like removing an alien people who had declared a war on the host nation. Much of the evidence used in the trials was dubious at best, and the defense had their hands tied on what could be rebutted. This was a case of Allied revenge, disguised as justice, and innocent humans murdered cheered on by the ignorant masses. I can tell you without fear that we did nothing that would tarnish our reputation, as an organization, and a political party. The victors of the war have had 55 years to work on their side of the story, to use traitors and cowards to help them build a twisted history of our movement and military. The SS was a very elite and honorable cadre of men and women; we honored our God, our ancestors, our people, and we fought for Europe until death or defeat.\nhttp://www.mourningtheancient.com/ww2-x24.htm\nStill others saw lying as a legitimate political method justified by past struggles.\nBig lie - Wikipedia\nHitler's description Hitler claimed that Jews had spread the \"big lie\" that General Erich Ludendorff was responsible for the country's loss in World War I . The source of the big lie technique is this passage, taken from Chapter 10 of James Murphy 's translation of Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf . (The quote is one paragraph in Murphy's translation and in the German original.) But it remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, and their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown a superhuman will and energy in his effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. By placing responsibility for the loss of the world war on the shoulders of Ludendorff they took away the weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice. All this was inspired by the principle – which is quite true within itself – that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. — Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , vol. I, ch. X [9] In 1943, The New York Times contributor Edwin James asserted that Hitler's biggest lie was his revisionist claim that Germany was not defeated in war in 1918, but rather was betrayed by internal groups. [10] This stab-in-the-back myth was spread by right-wing groups, including the Nazis . [11] In enacting the Holocaust According to historian Jeffrey Herf , the Nazis used the idea of the original big lie to turn sentiment against Jews and justify the Holocaust . Herf maintains that Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi Party actually used the big lie technique that they described – and that they used it to turn long-standing antisemitism in Europe into mass murder . [12] Herf further argues that the Nazis' big lie was their depiction of Germany as an innocent, besieged land striking back at international Jewry , which the Nazis blamed for starting World War I .

However, it is important to note that Holocaust denial is not a new phenomenon, and has been used by neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups as a way to promote their anti-Semitic and racist views.\nIt is likely that many WWII Nazis would have viewed Holocaust denial with skepticism, as they were firsthand witnesses to the atrocities committed during the war. However, it is also possible that some may have embraced denial as a way to minimize or justify their actions.\nIt is important to recognize that Holocaust denial is not based on factual evidence, and is widely considered to be a form of hate speech and propaganda. Denial of the Holocaust is not only offensive to survivors and their families, but also undermines the historical record and the lessons that we can learn from the events of WWII.",

Even many former members of the Nazi party who later renounced their involvement and expressed remorse for their actions have acknowledged the reality of the Holocaust.\nFurthermore, it is important to remember that Holocaust denial is not a new phenomenon and has been rejected by many people, including some individuals who held high positions in the Nazi regime. For example, in his memoirs, Albert Speer, a high-ranking Nazi official, acknowledged that he was aware of the extermination of the Jews and expressed remorse for his role in the regime.\nIn summary, while it is impossible to know the opinions of all individuals who were members of the Nazi party during World War II, it is safe to assume that those who participated in or supported the Holocaust would not be supportive of Holocaust denial.",

It is also possible that some former Nazis who are still alive may hold similar views or may seek to downplay their role in the Holocaust.

The film follows the last living generation of German participants in Adolf Hitler 's Third Reich . Final Account premiered at the 77th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2020. It was released on May 21, 2021, by Focus Features . Synopsis [ edit ] Over a decade in the making, the film raises questions about authority, conformity, complicity and perpetration, national identity, and responsibility, as men and women ranging from former SS members to civilians in never-before-seen interviews reckon with – in very different ways – their memories, perceptions and personal appraisals of their own roles in the Nazi war crimes. [4] Luke Holland, the late British filmmaker, interviewed over 300 elderly people - men and women from Germany and Austria - who, directly or indirectly, participated in the Third Reich, if only as witnesses (and if one considers that a witness is also a participant, more particularly if he or she witnesses atrocities and does nothing about it, insofar as anything could be done). Some of the interviewees took an active part in the Nazi regime: they were soldiers in the regular army (Wehrmacht) but, also, several were members of the elite corps of the SS, who were, in many ways, the backbone of the Nazi regime. Among the SS soldiers, some were officers and some were camp guards, guarding concentration and extermination camps where Jews and other inmates were worked to death and murdered. Others were farmers, local villagers, tradesmen, and so on. The first part of the film shows the level of indoctrination of the youth under the regime, which also explains what followed: from an early age, children and then teenagers (from the age of 10 or so) were enrolled in Nazi youth organisations (such as the Hitler Youth, from age 14). The aim was to brainwash them into being good Nazis and, for the boys, eager soldiers. In the main, it seemed to work very well from the standpoint of the Nazi regime. Of course, the key questions are asked, sooner or later, in the interviews. What did the interviewee know and what did he or she do? Did the interviewee take part in any atrocities? Did the interviewee know that atrocities were being committed all the time by the Nazi regime? Why did no one try to stop the Nazi killing mac\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Account_(film)",

It is also considered an insult to the memory of the victims and their families.\nGiven this, it is likely that real WW2 Nazis who were involved in the Holocaust would see Holocaust denial as a way of trying to rewrite history and absolve themselves of their crimes.

While it is challenging to objectively determine the \"saddest\" animal, there are several creatures that evoke deep emotions due to their perilous situations and vulnerability. From the Arctic to the rainforests and the depths of the ocean, this article explores some of the saddest animals on our planet, shedding light on the reasons behind their distressing circumstances and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect them.\nThe Polar Bear:\nThe polar bear, an icon of the Arctic wilderness, has become synonymous with the tragic consequences of climate change. As the planet warms, Arctic sea ice rapidly diminishes, leaving polar bears stranded and struggling to find food. Their primary prey, seals, heavily rely on the sea ice for hunting and breeding, further exacerbating the bear's plight. The sight of emaciated polar bears desperately searching for sustenance serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address climate change and protect their rapidly shrinking habitat.\nThe Sumatran Orangutan:\nThe Sumatran orangutan, one of our closest relatives, is native to the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. This critically endangered species faces a dire situation due to rampant deforestation and habitat destruction caused by palm oil plantations, logging, and illegal hunting. Orangutans are highly intelligent and sentient beings, and their sorrowful eyes mirror the loss of their homes and families. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival and to safeguard the delicate ecosystems they inhabit.\nThe North Atlantic Right Whale:\nThe North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered large whale species globally, with an estimated population of just over 350 individuals. They face multiple threats, including entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with ships. The loss of these majestic creatures not only impacts their population but also disturbs the balance of marine ecosystems. Struggling to recover from centuries of whaling, the plight of the North Atlantic right whale serves as a haunting reminder of humanity's impact on marine life.\nThe Vaquita:\nThe vaquita, a small porpoise found only in the Gulf of California, Mexico, holds the unfortunate title of the world's most endangered marine mammal. With an estimated population of fewer than 10 individuals, this species teeters on the brink of extinction due to accidental entanglement in illegal gillnets used for fishing the totoaba, a critically endangered fish. Conservationists race against time to save the vaquita from vanishing forever, highlighting the need for stronger regulations and enforcement to protect marine species from such tragic fates.\nThe Amur Leopard:\nThe Amur leopard, native to the temperate forests of eastern Russia and parts of China, faces the threat of habitat loss, poaching, and diminishing prey populations. With only around 100 individuals remaining in the wild, it is one of the most critically endangered big cat species in the world. The thought of these magnificent creatures disappearing from the wild leaves a heavy weight on conservationists' hearts, urging urgent action to preserve their habitats and protect them from illegal hunting.\nThe Saola:\nThe saola, often referred to as the \"Asian unicorn,\" is an elusive and enigmatic antelope species found in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. Tragically, it is critically endangered and possibly one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. The saola's habitat is threatened by deforestation, illegal hunting, and the impact of infrastructure development. With such limited knowledge about this species, conservationists face a race against time to understand and protect it from extinction.\nThe African Elephant:\nThe African elephant, one of the most iconic and intelligent animals on the planet, is under severe threat from poaching for its ivory tusks and habitat loss. Illegal ivory trade continues to fuel the decline of elephant populations across the African continent. The heart-wrenching scenes of orphaned baby elephants, left traumatized and vulnerable after witnessing the murder of their mothers, stand as a powerful plea for humanity to take responsibility for the survival of these majestic giants.\nClick more\nConclusion:\nThe world is home to an astonishing array of life, each species playing a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems. While designating the \"saddest\" animal may be subjective, it is undeniable that many creatures face dire circumstances that demand our attention and action. The examples provided in this article are just a glimpse of the countless animals whose survival is threatened by human activities.\nThe onus lies on humanity to recognize the interconnectedness of all life and to take decisive steps toward conservation and sustainable practices. Through education, awareness, and responsible actions, we can rewrite the narrative for these saddest animals, offering them a glimmer of hope and a chance for survival in an ever-changing world. The time to act is now, for every species lost is a piece of our planet's heritage forever gone, leaving an indelible mark on the world we leave for future generations.\n👉Click here for more",
      "10": "The title of \"saddest animal on Earth\" is often given to Arturo, a polar bear who lived in Mendoza Zoo in Argentina. Arturo was born in 1986 in a zoo in Germany and was moved to Mendoza Zoo in 1990. He lived in a small concrete enclosure that was not suitable for polar bears, and he was often seen pacing back and forth, showing signs of stress and depression.\nAfter his partner, Pelusa, died from cancer in 2012, Arturo's condition worsened. He became increasingly withdrawn and lethargic, and he lost interest in eating and playing. A petition was started to have Arturo moved to a more suitable climate, but it was denied by the zoo. Arturo died in 2014 at the age of 28.\nWhile Arturo's story is particularly sad, there are many other animals who are living in captivity or in poor conditions that could be considered \"sad.\" These animals may be lonely, bored, or stressed, and they may not have access to the food, water, or enrichment that they need. It is important to remember that all animals deserve to live in conditions that meet their physical and emotional needs.\nHere are some other animals who have been called \"the saddest animals in the world\":\nKaavan, the loneliest elephant in the world, lived in a zoo in Pakistan for 35 years.\nWendy the whale, was found beached and alone in Scotland.\nTilikum, the orca was captured from the wild and lived in captivity for 30 years.\nHarambe, the gorilla who was shot and killed after a child fell into his enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo.\nThese are just a few examples of animals who have been through difficult experiences. It is important to remember that all animals deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.",
      "11": "The word saddest is a human concept. And humans are animals. So the answer to your question is humans who can suffer for a myraid different reasons.\nBut\nI assume by animals you mean non human animals.\nThen most mammals and birds suffer from stress and anxiety. Every mammal possesses what what we call cortisol. This hormone is an indicator of stress in animals and is often used as an indicative of poor welfare.Of course you would’nt expect them to speak about their problems though some animals do become either extremely vocal or deathly silent in cases of danger or death.\nSome animals are social, so entrapping them in cages leads to adrenaline, cortisol stress which can hamper their appetite and reduce their activities thus indicating that the animals are in ‘depression’.\nBtw most higher mammals like apes and dolphins do show certain signs of depression. Any pet owner can attest to the fact that their pets may ‘grieve’(i.e. alter or reduce their dietary or behavioral activities’) in the case of death of a bonded partner. Some may even try to ‘revive’ their partners by nudging, biting or more aggresively mating with the corpse.\nAnd for the sobriquet for the world’s saddest animal was given to a polar bear named Arturo in the zoo of argentina.\nRead the article Animal grief on wiki for better insight.",
      "12": "It is difficult to definitively determine the \"saddest\" animal on Earth, as different animals experience emotions in various ways, and their perceived emotions might not be the same as human emotions. However, some animals are known to display behavior that might be interpreted as sadness or distress.\nOne such animal is the polar bear. As the Arctic ice melts due to climate change, polar bears are facing increasing challenges in their natural habitat. Their hunting and food sources are diminishing, leading to starvation and a struggle to survive. This has led to polar bears being considered a vulnerable species, and their future remains uncertain due to the ongoing effects of climate change.\nAnother animal that is often associated with sadness is the sloth. Sloths have a slow and lethargic demeanor, and their natural habitat is being threatened by deforestation and human activities. Their sluggishness and vulnerability to changes in their environment have led some people to empathize with them, perceiving them as \"sad\" creatures.\nIt is essential to approach these interpretations with sensitivity and recognize that animals have their own ways of experiencing emotions and adapting to their environments. Conservation efforts and responsible actions to protect their habitats can help ensure the well-being of these and other animal species on Earth.",

      "1": "I would not recommend eating bad bread. I got so sick this last Christmas. Ate some bad bread. No joke. Seriously I was bad for like a good 3 hours I would say at least. Intense and very serious stomach pain and toilet issues. I thot about calling 911 or having to go to hospital it was so bad. The next day I was fine but man I am not kidding I would not take the chance it is not worth the risk. Also just to note I cannot be certain it was the bread but I am pretty sure. Like what else could it have been. Man tho it was so bad. That is my thoughts on the matter. Really bad pain like someone shot me in the stomach with a shotgun or something no joke. Lol",
      "2": "If one piece gets moldy, believe me even if you don’t see it in the other pieces, it is there. I know that I would smell that mold. Here is an idea for you…refrigerate the bread or take slices out as you need them and freeze the rest. It’s a shame to waste the bread, so feed the birds with the bread you don’t eat.",
      "3": "I would definitely throw the whole loaf away it had to be laying around for sometime to produce mold most likely the whole loaf is infested not to mention it being stale. I always keep bread in the refrigerator it stays fresh much longer!",
      "4": "If there is one moldy slice of bread in a loaf it won’t be long before the rest of the loaf is moldy.\nYes throw the entire loaf out. Mold has spores that become air borne and spread through the air,( even the limited air in a bread bag), to other pieces of bread in the bag. Just because the mold is not in full bloom does not mean it has not spread to the rest of the loaf.",
      "5": "I throw away the rest of a loaf if I even spot a tiny dot of mold. Much of the mold is microscopic, which means you cannot see it. According to the USDA\n:\nMolds have branches and roots that are like very thin threads. The roots may be difficult to see when the mold is growing on food and may be very deep in the food. Foods that are moldy may also have invisible bacteria growing along with the mold.\nThe USDA says to throw away any bread with visible mold, so that is what I do. If I know we are not going to be able to eat bread before it goes bad, I do one of two things:\nCube the bread and dry it. In more humid months, I will do this in the oven. The cubed bread can either be pulverized for bread crumbs or frozen for use in stratas and bread puddings. It can also be used as crouton in soups and salads.\nSlice the bread and freeze it. This bread will only be good for toast, but, honestly? I don’t trust a bread that is soft for more than a couple of days, and we really like toast.",
      "6": "Since I was asked to answer. There might be mold that you can't see throughout the loaf. That said its all about what you have trained your body to deal with . if you are someone who only eats fresh of everything and always follows package instructions etc. on how to store food then you may want to toss the entire thing and start over. If you live in a situation that you push things and eat stuff that has been left out overnight or two..like college kids or people who just push the envelope a bit,you can throw away the one piece or trim off the mold and toast it. It really depends on what you think your body will do",
      "7": "Bread takes several days to mould. By the time it happens, the bread is already getting old, and usually mostly eaten. Just because I only see one patch of mould does not mean the rest of the bread is clear. The mycelium (mould fibres) could be growing inside the bread, just getting ready to erupt.\nWhen it comes to dealing with suspect food, I compare the cost of wasting the food with the cost of getting medical treatment should a problem develop. The food rarely wins.\nI may be being over cautious, but mouldy bread goes straight into the trash.",
      "8": "Just because you don't see the green stuff doesn't mean the fungus isn't growing. I don't know how much fungus one has to digest before getting sick. It most likely depends on the health and age of the person eating the bread.",
      "9": "The color of the mold represents the mature spores that are ready to be dispersed. Long before this coloration is visible to the eye, the bread has already been colonised by the colorless/translucent mycelia of the fungus.\nSo yeah, throw the whole thing away. Fungal mycelia too secrete toxic metabolites that can mess with your gut.",
      "10": "I have no interest in eating moldy bread. Moldy white bread won’t kill you, in fact the penicillium might cure a disease or two, but no need if you’re healthy. Moldy rye on the other hand is much more toxic.\nI’d pitch it, but that rarely happens in my home. I refrigerate or freeze leftover bread if I have any before it shows any signs of mold. Frozen bread still makes great toast. Come to think of it, I’ve got some English Muffins in my freezer too.",
      "11": "I throw away that slice and the one below it",
      "12": "A2A: It’s pretty unlikely that only one slice of bread is mouldy. What you’re seeing is visible mould on one slice. The mould on the other slices simply hasn’t progressed enough to be visible, but it’s still there.\nChuck the lot out.",
      "13": "Entire loaf.\nBread is porous, mold can travel between slices.",
      "14": "YES! The mold permeates the entire loaf. Throw it away or feed it to the birds or ducks.",
      "15": "I suggest you stop buying sliced bread and bake your own. It tastes so good it won’t last long enough to go mouldy. Problem solved!",
      "16": "Throw it away. The mould may be pathogenic and the spores are not visible to the naked eye.",
      "17": "I’d throw the whole loaf away just to be safe. You don’t want to risk getting food poisoning. A $2 loaf of bread is nothing compared to getting sick.",
      "18": "Just take the pieceof Mold off. Or even eat the piece of Mold. Isn't Pennecillin made from Moldy Cheese.",
      "19": "Just that slice, but be aware, now there are mold spores in that loaf.

      "1": "I want to tell you a story.\nThe name of this story is 《Oh my God, it's too difficult to build a Tesla factory in Germany.》\nIn 2017, Tesla Model 3 was mass-produced, ending the era of Tesla's crazy money-burning and non-profitability.\nIn the following two years, huge production pressure has been plagued Tesla.\nIf the production capacity is not increased, the profit will not be increased.\nBecause it burned too much money when doing research and development in the past, Tesla's debt interest was an astronomical figure every day.\nIf the profit cannot cover the interest, then Tesla will be in a state of continuous loss.\nSo the wonders in human history appeared.\nOn the one hand, product supply is in short supply, on the other hand, Tesla’s capital chain is on the verge of collapse and may fall into a debt crisis at any time.\nAs long as the production capacity can be increased, all problems will be solved, but the production capacity cannot be increased.\nIn 2018, Musk came to China and tried to use China's speed to build a super factory to expand production capacity for Tesla.\nIn just three months, Musk had reached an agreement with Shanghai.\nShanghai provided Tesla with a huge piece of land at a price of 10% for the construction of a factory, and at the same time provided 18.5 billion yuan in loans for Tesla, which is in short supply, with an annualized interest rate as low as 3.9%.\nThese two conditions are equivalent to sending money to Tesla, but Shanghai is not losing money.\nBecause Musk promised in the agreement that starting from 2023, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory will pay no less than RMB 2.23 billion in taxes to China every year, otherwise Tesla will return the land.\nAfter signing the agreement, Musk learned what China speed is.\nIn October 2018, the agreement was officially signed.\nIn December 2018, all land has been leveled and all construction units have entered the site.\nIn January 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Factory officially started construction.\nIn November 2019, the Tesla Shanghai Factory was completed and all equipment was installed in place.\nOne month after commissioning, the assembly line was officially launched, and the entire factory began to run wildly.\nFrom the signing of the agreement to the completion of the factory, it took only one year, of which the construction period was only 10 months, far less than the 2-year construction period planned by Musk.\nThis is simply a miracle.\nSince the sale of the first car at Tesla's Shanghai factory, Tesla's profits have exceeded interest expenses, and Tesla no longer has the pressure to break the capital chain.\nTo celebrate this historic moment, Musk even danced happily in public.\nThe Chinese factory is the first overseas super factory set up by Tesla, and it helped Musk solve a huge problem.\nAfter a person tastes the sweetness, the first reaction is of course to copy his own past success.\nTherefore, Musk decided to build a second overseas super factory.\nThis time, he chose Germany, the center of European automobile manufacturing.\nThen, he was slapped in the face severely.\nIn November 2019, the month when Tesla's Shanghai factory was fully completed, Musk announced that it would build a super factory in Germany.\nThe site is located in Grunheide in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, only 24 miles from Berlin.\nThe government officials of Brandenburg welcome Tesla very much, because it will bring huge taxes and tens of thousands of job opportunities to the local area.\nIt can also bring hundreds of thousands of related jobs through the industry chain.\nThe benefits are too much. So they sold a 300 hectare plot of land to Tesla.\nChina built the Tesla Gigafactory in just 10 months?\nBrandenburg State Minister of Economic Affairs Jörg Steinbach said:\n\"The Tesla team here is determined to beat the team in China, in a few weeks.\"\nIt seems that everything is developing in a better direction.\nAs a result, Musk did not expect that this was the beginning of a nightmare.\nThe land that Tesla took was ordinary, but it was not abandoned, and some artificial economic forests were planted on it.\nAfter acquiring the land, first level the ground, that is, cut down these economic forests, and then cause trouble.\nEnvironmentalists immediately came out to protest and took Tesla to court, saying that these trees cannot be cut down.\nThe man-made economic forest is also forest.\nHow could Tesla cut it casually? This is a serious damage to the local ecological environment.\nAfter repeated negotiations, Tesla promised to replant more than three times the economic forest in other places, and finally settled the matter.\nThen can the land be leveled?\nOf course not.\nEnvironmentalists also found that the Tesla Gigafactory consumes about 3.6 million cubic meters of water each year, which accounts for 30% of the local water supply.\nTherefore, environmentalists say that the establishment of the Tesla factory will seriously consume the local water reserves.\nAnd held a protest demonstration on January 18.\nIt seems that Tesla uses a lot of water, but there are actually only 8,700 residents in the area, and the Tesla factory alone has 12,000 employees in production.\nUsing 30% of the water does not seem excessive.\nNot to mention that this is production water, not domestic water.\nOn the contrary, those 8,700 residents want 70% of the water, which I personally think is a bit too much.\nBut it doesn't make sense, because the topic of water resources is regarded by some local political parties as an excellent opportunity to get the attention and votes, and they don't care whether Tesla is dead or not.\nChristian Rechholz, chairman of the German Eco-Democratic Party, delivered a speech in various media, claiming that he was very disappointed with the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology:\n\"This confirms our biggest worry. Now there are even more land that will be poured with concrete without submitting an application. Tesla is trying to realize its own interests at the expense of European taxpayers. The protection of water, people, and nature is slowly disappearing like the rule of law!” “How can Peter Altmaier (the current German Minister of Economy) ignore the concerns of Brandenburg citizens about drinking water and nature reserves and let this family American companies have once again \"temporarily started construction\" at their own risk? We should not forget that their electric car factory has not yet obtained the final construction permit.\" \"With the addition of the world's largest battery factory, Brandon Fort and Berlin will eventually become dry land. You cannot simply sacrifice our precious drinking water for profit. This huge fanaticism is threatening people and nature.\"\nIn short, some ordinary German citizens who have not even graduated from high school think that the chairman of the German Ecological Democratic Party is a good person, and sincerely considers the future of Germany, he must be voted for next time.\nAs a result, the voice of anti-Tesla became louder.\nWhat to do?\nAfter repeated negotiations, Tesla promised to reduce its water consumption.\nCan you start work then?\nOf course it still can't.\nEnvironmentalists also claimed that the woods cut down by Tesla is a habitat for bats.\nJanuary 2020 is the hibernation season for them.\nThey should not be disturbed, otherwise they will die in large numbers. After the hibernation is over, the bats will enter the mating season, and then breed babies, so it can't be disturbed. You need to wait for the bat babies to grow up before cutting down the woods to give them time to move.\nThere is no way to negotiate this, and Tesla will blamed as a cold-blooded butcher in everything it says.\nTherefore, Tesla urgently hired the German environmental protection agency to conduct a species survey on the entire forest area.\nThe investigation report showed that there were only 2 bats in the entire forest area.\nTherefore, Tesla claims that the construction of the factory will not cause any particularly serious impact.\nOn February 13, 2020, Tesla felt that he had done everything, and started logging wood and preparing to build a factory.\nThen, environmentalists found in the species survey list that there are wolves, lizards, and even ants in this area, all of which must be protected.\nYes, Tesla must properly relocate the ant colony in this woods as required.\nIn short, environmentalists will never allow Tesla to completely clean up this forest, but after repeated negotiations and efforts, first level a small part of the land, and leave the rest to be negotiated later.\nIn April 2020, the first small piece of land was finally leveled.\nThe Tesla German team, which claimed to surpass the Chinese team, took a full 5 months to complete the land leveling step and leveled only part of the land. Dear, can we start?\nOf course it is still not possible, because Tesla has to wait for construction permits.\nThe Tesla German team expects to obtain the construction permit in 7 months, and they will do their best to achieve this goal.\nThe reason why we have to wait so long is because the establishment of the Tesla factory is a political achievement for some government officials, but it is a source of trouble for some government officials. No one wants to get in trouble for Tesla.\nFor example, the Brandenburg State Department of Agriculture requires Tesla to use a special material during construction to protect groundwater sources.\nRegarding the issue of groundwater protection, it took Tesla a month and a half to obtain the construction permit.\nFor example, the German environmental protection department believes that the vibration of the pile driver may affect the surrounding railways during the construction of the Tesla factory.\nTherefore, Tesla must provide a safe construction plan and submit it for review.\nThis item took another month. There are also various construction permit approvals, and Tesla needs to meet the requirements of various government departments.\nIn short, by November 2020, Tesla, which took 7 months to go through the formalities, still has not obtained all the construction permits, and was forced to postpone the start date.\nOn December 7, 2020, when the remaining construction permits had not yet been obtained, environmentalists again found a hibernating snake underground in Tesla's woodland. . .\nOh my god, it's pretty good.\nHow can I interfere with Master Snake's hibernation in order to build a broken factory?\nYou have to wait for the end of Snake's hibernation to start work.\nOn December 8, 2020, the environmental protection organization received an emergency construction prohibition order from the court. . .\nAs a result, Tesla's dream of building a factory shattered again, although it was still a blank place as of December.\nOn February 21, 2021, Lord Snake finally woke up.\nThe head of Tesla's German team was almost crying with excitement, so he ordered logging as soon as possible.\nbut. . .\nIn April 2021, the Water Authority discovered that some of Tesla's water pipes had been installed without permission, and ordered Tesla to suspend work for rectification.\nIn May 2021, the German regulatory agency found that the construction permit for the 4680 battery production line at the Tesla factory lacked a so-called permit that can be used as a power battery, and ordered Tesla to apply for a special permit.\nIn June 2021, the environmental protection organization protested and suspected that Tesla could not control the toxic gas generated during construction. The environmental protection department asked Tesla to explain this and stop work for rectification.\nIn July 2021, someone found some so-called chemical cans that were exposed at the Tesla construction site. This thing was not on the application documents and had not been approved by the government. So work was suspended, fined, and rectification ordered.\nThe reason why it is so easy to stop Tesla’s work is because Tesla has not obtained a complete construction permit until today, and various approvals have not been completed.\nThe Tesla German team has only obtained temporary construction permits for many activities.\nTherefore, any government department can stop the construction progress of the Tesla Gigafactory.\nIn July of this year, Musk had set the latest completion date for the factory. （And just to apply for an environmental protection permit, the thickness of the information reaches as much as 11,000 pages.）\nAs a result, Tesla's German factory was still seriously delayed.\nFrom the beginning of land acquisition in November 2019, to July 2021, a total of 20 months have passed.\nNot to mention the completion, Tesla has not yet obtained the official construction permit from the German government!\nTesla sneakily engaged in a small project, and barely covered the building shell, but the inside was completely empty.\nIt is really too difficult to build a Tesla factory in Germany.",

The electric vehicle industry in China is the largest in the world, accounting for around 57.4% of global production of electric vehicles (EVs) and around 500,000 exports in 2021. [1] In 2021, CAAM reported China had sold 3.34 million passenger electric vehicles, consisting 2.73 million BEVs ( battery-only EVs ) and 0.6 million PHEV ( plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ), [2] which is around 53% share of the global market of 6.23 million \"new energy\" passenger vehicles – BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs. [3] China also dominates the plug-in electric bus and light commercial vehicle market, reaching over 500,000 buses (98% of global stock) and 247,500 electric commercial vehicles (65% of global stock) in 2019, [ citation needed ] and recording new sales of 186,000 commercial EVs in 2021. [2] Plug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021. [4] NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025. [5] The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots. [6] The battery industry is closely related to the EV industry as batteries constitute around 1/3 of the cost of EVs [7] and around 80% of lithium-ion batteries in the world are used in EVs. [8] The industry also has significant Chinese presence, with major players including world's largest CATL , BYD , CALB , Gotion , SVOLT and WeLion . [9] History [ edit ] Electric vehicle manufacturers [ edit ] Plug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021. [4] NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025. [5] The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots. [6] It is difficult to estimate the comparative size of EV companies in China as foreign companies such as Tesla and VW have significant sales and manufacturing in China, while Chinese companies such as BYD have significant overseas sales. Some Chinese companies also have foreign-based subsidiaries such as Geely , which owns Polestar and Lynk & Co . Foreign companies [ edit ] Tesla opened its first \"Gigafactory\" outside the United States in Shanghai, China, in 2019. Giga Shanghai was the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company, and was built in less than 6 months, becoming Tesla's main export hub.

Tesla will also be getting expanded market opportunities in the U.S. and the E.U. as success in the Chinese market would endow.",
      "6": "Elon Musk has been friendly to China for several reasons. Firstly, China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, and Musk's company, Tesla, has a significant presence in the Chinese market. In fact, China is one of Tesla's biggest markets, and the company has made significant investments in the country, including building a factory in Shanghai. It's in Tesla's best interest to maintain good relations with the Chinese government and market.\nSecondly, Musk has praised China's efforts to promote renewable energy and combat climate change, which aligns with his own goals for sustainable energy. Musk has even said that China has the potential to become a leader in renewable energy technology.\nFinally, Musk has also praised China's efficiency and speed in implementing large infrastructure projects, such as the construction of high-speed rail and its ambitious space program. As a businessman and entrepreneur, Musk likely recognizes the benefits of working with a government that is able to execute large-scale projects efficiently and quickly.\nIt's important to note that while Musk has been friendly to China, he has also expressed some criticisms of the country, particularly regarding its policies on censorship and intellectual property.",
      "7": "As far as my work experience is concerned, in addition to efficient factories and potential markets, China has a complete and advanced industrial chain in the new energy industry.\nIn recent years, as a trader of mechanical and electrical products in China, I can feel the continuous growth of new energy-related products",
      "8": "Elon Musk wants to earn more money.\nChina is the biggest EV market.\nChina is friendly to Elon Musk and other foreign investors.",
      "9": "Actually，I like him, he has a good personality and smile a lot, and you will know these from all his interviews and speeches.\nYep, Elon Musk is a friendly person, but it doesnt mean and I dont think Elon Musk so friend to China.\nHe is just a tech and science craze，besides, He has no reason to hate a country who has done nothing to him. And what he said just came out of his personal logistics without any unreasonable prejudice.\nIf Elon Musk also see things just with his mouth instead of his own eyes and brains , this world will be horrible. Media will control everything, Just imagine.\nBlessed.",
      "10": "I'm Chinese and I want to share some views from a Chinese perspective. Tesla Giga Shanghai brought thousands of jobs, which has alleviated the employment pressure in the Yangtze River Delta region to some extent. What’s more important, is that Tesla pays workers salaries that far exceed the average wage level in China's new energy automobile industry (of course, it complies with the laws of both China and the United States). At the time then, some Chinese entrepreneurs and social media attacked Mr. Musk for such behavior. Is Elon Musk a capitalist? Yes, he totally is. However, ordinary workers believe that enough salaries prove Tesla is a nice employer (and Musk may be a nice guy). In addition, the series of sanctions against Chinese enterprises formulated by the Biden administration has caused lots of dissatisfaction among the government and the public. Mr. Musk is the main sponsor of Ron DeSantis who has officially announced participation in the 2024 US presidential election. So some Chinese people hope that Musk can serve as a communication bridge between the Chinese and the new American governments in the future and further alleviate tense diplomatic relations. So Musk's goodwill towards China may only be due to the importance of the Chinese market, just like many other respondents analyzed that the Chinese market is of course very important for any multinational company. But China's goodwill towards Musk is caused by multiple factors. That's partly why Mr. Musk can receive high-quality reception in China.",
      "11": "And why should he not be.? He is a businessman and a risk-taker. He has been to China many times and did his due diligence research ( plus his instincts ). He knows all the exaggerated lies about China, and he knows China is “way, way ahead of what the media lets on”. He has voiced this openly in some TV interviews. So, why not be super-friendly to China ? In China he gets workers support . In the US he gets workers headaches . China has the potential he craves ?",
      "12": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has shown a level of engagement and cooperation with China in various ways. However, the specific reasons behind his friendly stance toward China may be influenced by several factors:\n1. Market Potential: China is the world's largest automobile market, and the electric vehicle (EV) industry in China has been growing rapidly. With Tesla being a leading EV manufacturer, Musk likely recognizes the significant market potential that China offers for his company's products. Maintaining a positive relationship with the Chinese government and consumers can be crucial for Tesla's success in the Chinese market.\n2. Manufacturing and Supply Chain: China has a well-developed manufacturing ecosystem, and many global companies, including Tesla, have established production facilities or supply chain networks in the country. Maintaining positive relations with Chinese authorities can help ensure smooth operations, favorable regulations, and access to resources necessary for manufacturing and distribution.\n3. Access to Resources and Investments: China has been investing heavily in renewable energy and advanced technologies, including electric vehicles and batteries. Musk's friendly approach toward China may be driven by his desire to access Chinese resources, technologies, and potential investment opportunities that align with his companies' objectives.\n4. Diplomatic Considerations: Business leaders often navigate diplomatic considerations and work to maintain positive relationships with governments worldwide. Musk's friendly approach toward China might also be driven by a desire to avoid unnecessary conflicts and facilitate collaboration in areas of mutual interest.\nIt is important to note that while Musk has expressed positive sentiments toward China and its potential, he has also acknowledged challenges and complexities within the Chinese market and business environment. Business decisions and strategic relationships are influenced by a range of factors, including market dynamics, business interests, geopolitical considerations, and long-term goals.",
      "13": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed a positive attitude towards China in the past because the country has been a key market for his companies. Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces electric vehicles for the Chinese market, and SpaceX has plans to launch satellites in partnership with a Chinese company. Additionally, the Chinese government has been investing heavily in renewable energy and electric vehicles, which aligns with Musk's own goals of reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable energy.",
      "14": "Elon Musk is a scientist and he can see the future of science in China. All he sees in USA now is both GOP/Democrats politicising everything. He is not friendly to China, he is friendly to a science led world. And American exceptionalism to him is not science.",

The Shanghai factory almost saved him from bankcrupt and now the capacity of Tesla's Shanghai factory is 1.2 million per yerar, means over a half of the global capacity is from the Shanghai factory, also the model 3/y is very popular in China (sales over 70k monthly), so now you know why he is so friendly to China.",
      "16": "Money talks. When you have invested billions of dollars in China, you would be friendly to China too.\nWhy did he invest in China? Because China is a big market, silly!",
      "17": "Businessman loves where they can get their business plan succeeded. I copy and paste some word I used to answer other question.\nIt will tell you why MUSK loves China.\nWhen Elon Musk applied to build his Tesla factor in Shanghai, it took 3 months to finalize the agreement with city of Shanghai, the deal also included a 18 billion Yuan loan provided by local government and the land required for the factory with a price only 10% of the market value. It took 10 month to have the factory built and all equipments ready, it started to produce after one month tunimg time. So it took less than a year to have Musk's dream comes true there. now you know the reason why Musk loves CCP so much. Ok, Musk Asli want to have a factory in Germany, he applied and bought the land on November of 2019, and he is still waiting for the government to issue the building permit now, 20 months later, only God knows how long it will take German government to issue the building permit, and how long the construction will be completed.",

      "20": "There is only one explanation for that. Elon Musk is a very smart and visionary person. He knows where to put his eggs best.",
      "21": "Elon Musk has visited China many times. The Chinese people he has come into contact with range from ordinary workers to the leaders of CPC. So he is undoubtedly one of the more knowledgeable Americans about the real situation in China right now.\nBesides, as one of the richest people in the world, would he go against his will to brag about China for some benefits? Could it be that the words of the United States Ambassador to China, who is a representative of the United States Government, are more neutral and credible than Elon’s?\nTherefore, there is reason to believe that the vast majority of what he said about China should be credible.",
      "22": "His Tesla cars are the most popular cars in the No.1 and No.2 biggest auto markets in the world. That is why. You cannot even figure that out, that says it all about your mental capacity, or lack of such.",
      "23": "Like so many American and Western businessmen and celebrities eager for a piece of the lucrative Chinese marketplace, Musk and others are shamelessly kowtowing to CCP fascist overlords and are promoting their lies and propaganda. They demonstrate the depravity of men and their greed."

(applause) and finally landed at the Jezero Crater - an area on the red planet that was once flooded with water (and by once, I mean around 3.5 billion years ago).\nAs an FYI - from a scientific research perspective, this 2 year old kid couldn't have touched down in a better spot! (I mean talk about kids growing up fast these days)\nNow admittedly, Bowens arrival on Mars was probably not exactly how Elon Musk had envisaged things over at SpaceX…\n.. but as the old saying goes, there are more than one way to skin a cat.\nBowen's route to Mars was slightly different to that of Elon.\nAbout 2 years ago (around the time that our son arrived on his 1st planet - i.e. earth), NASA invited people from around the world to submit their names to ride aboard the Perseverance Rover on its mission to Mars.\nAlong with Bowen, nearly 11 million other good people had their names were stenciled by electron beam onto three fingernail-sized silicon chips, which were subsequently included on board the Perseverance Rover that left earth from Cape Canaveral in Florida, US on 30 July 2020.\nAnd on Feb. 18, 2021 at 12:55 p.m. PST / 3:55 p.m. EST the Perseverance Rover, the name of one great 2 year old boy and 11 million other names successful landed on Mars🚀🥳\nIn conclusion, it was a pretty damn cool initiative by NASA and offered at a very reasonable cost of $0 for anyone interested.\nI'm not sure about the other 11 million people & their families, but this family appreciated it and gives NASA two very enthusiastic thumbs up for putting Bowens name on Mars 👍👍\nNice work NASA!👏\nSource & photo references along with more information about the mission and the innovative initiative can be found below:\nLanding Toolkit: Perseverance Rover\nOne-stop shopping for everything you need to know about the upcoming landing of the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover.\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/",

The last period of Perseverance's journey to Mars begins when the rocket arrives at the highest point of the Martian climate while going at around 12,100 mph (19,500 kph).\nThe rocket's warmth shield will be at its most sweltering around 75 seconds after barometrical section, when the temperature at the outside surface of the shield comes to around 2,370 degrees Fahrenheit (1,300 degrees Celsius).\nTo build the odds of a protected handling, the mission group has added new advancements known as Range Trigger and Terrain-Relative Navigation that weren't around when Curiosity arrived on Mars in 2012.\nReach Trigger is another strategy intended to improve the circumstance the parachute's organization, empowering a more exact landing position. The parachute will open 4 minutes after section, at a height of around 7 miles (11 km) while falling at a speed of around 940 mph (1,512 kph). Twenty seconds after the parachute sends, the warmth shield will separate and fall away.\nAround 90 seconds after the warmth shield isolates, the back shell, with the parachute connected, will leave away from the plunge stage and meanderer at an elevation of about 1.3 miles (2.1 km). Now, the plummet stage's rockets will start up to slow the shuttle (for the controlled plunge stage) from 190 mph (306 kph) at 6,900 feet (2,100 meters) to 1.7 mph (2.7 kph) at 66 feet (20 meters) over the surface.\nTerritory Relative Navigation, which starts during the early piece of controlled plunge, is a sort of autopilot framework able to do rapidly working out the rocket's area, empowering it to choose the most secure reachable landing objective. Strangely, the framework will have the option to change the meanderer's score point by up to 2,000 feet (600 meters).\nIn the last minutes, the plummet stage will broaden nylon lines holding Perseverance, bringing down the meanderer a distance of 25 feet (7.6 meters). At the point when the shuttle recognizes that the meanderer has landed, the associating strings will sever.\nConstancy is set to land in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45-km-wide) sway bowl with an antiquated stream delta, steep precipices, sand ridges, stones, and more modest effect pits.\nThe principle objectives of NASA's Mars 2020 mission incorporate looking for indications of old life, gathering rock and soil tests for re-visitation of Earth, and assembling information for future human investigation of the distant planet.\nThe mission will likewise observe an airplane fly for the absolute first time on another planet when NASA's Ingenuity helicopter, which is going with Perseverance, lifts off from the Martian surface for its lady flight.\nNASA's central goal isn't the just one advancing toward Mars at the present time, with others from China and the United Arab Emirates additionally booked to arrive at the planet in February 2021.",

      "1": "A Chinese friend explained it to me like this: “Imagine Mao like Moses… only what if Moses, after freeing the slaves, turned out to be a bit nasty? Made some mistakes dealing with the Israelites. Beat his wife, became a drunkard and a cheater. Awful. But wouldn’t he still be Moses?”\n“So you admire him, you hate him…?”\n“He was a necessary figure. Not a good figure, not a bad figure, just necessary. The right person at the right time to deliver us from bondage.”\nFew will outright hate Mao in China, not after seventy-plus years of being taught in school how he founded the nation, how he’s heroic and great, his likeness everywhere, paintings hard to miss… no, he’s not hated. But he’s not quite revered like a living God, either. This is a fairly common attitude with founding fathers outside of America; ask an Indian about Gandhi sometimes, you’ll be surprised by the answers you get.\nI’ve heard a lot of echoes of the same sentiment — Mao fucked up, but they’re glad he existed because he founded their country and he made it theirs. Deng Xiaoping gets a lot more of the ‘hero worship’ treatment.",
      "2": "Jean-Marie Valheur gives a good example: “Mao and Moses.”\nThat’s a good one. I am not too familiar with Moses, but for Mao, many would agree that he is indispensable for China’s liberation. I just can’t imagine China’s history throughout the bloody 20th century, without him. He’s more like the combination of Napolean and Moses.\nPart of reason I said that is because Mao is also a military genius. By that I don’t mean him as a brute, although he is quite tall for his demography(Hunan).\nHe built a new army, a modern army from scratch. Before him, there is army and there is new and modern in China, but the two didn’t reconcile.\nThere is a saying in Old China that goes like this: “Thieves sieves through villages, army combs through them.” Army will not only take your belongings, they will take your daughter and sometimes your boy, just for their own benefit. To call the old army bandits are an insult to the bandits. Some bandits have dignity, you know.\nAnd Mao saw all the savagery and he actually did a little field trip investigation of China’s rural side. He came back with a report. And from that he draws the conclusion that Communist International(Third International) in Moscow is, generally speaking, talking blind.\nYes, at that time, Communist party are an international group, and probably a truly committed one. The thing is, when they give money and training support to communists in other countries, they don’t know the real deal on the ground. Or rather, their head are bound by their books and manifestos.\nFor something to really work, you have to adapt, change and evolve. Mao did just that. He found out that the supposed “workers in factory to be the main force of communist evolution” is hooey, for one simple reason: There are not enough factories in China, unlike Karl Marx’s Germany. Matter of fact, following a book written 80 years ago(at that time) word by word is silly. It would be like following the Bible for the second coming of Jesus.\nWe all know that, but what do we do? If you are not following the book, you better write something yourself. And Mao is a great writer. He had his report, he knows a lot about China’s common people and he gives his answer:\nPeasants are the main force of China’s revolution, and there are three big mountains upon them: imperialism, feudalism, and crony capitalism.\nThe three big mountains comes from the old Chinese tales. It’s like the The Myth of Sisyphus where god is playing a cruel game and hurl down three mountains on your back. But the good part is, Chinese people in that story, removed that mountain, bit by bit, brick by brick, calluses by calluses. It would take me a thousand generations to do it, but it can be done.\nMao is going to remove the three mountains. His mistake was, he want it too fast.\nBut he didn’t know that. He found his truth, and he speaks it. He writes about it. And people who recognize it, took it in. They followed him, and from that they built the greatest human infantry the world has ever seen.\nHe leads this new army, and they won some impossible victories. People tend to idolize champions of war. Think Napolean.\nOh, and did I mention he’s a poet? and a pretty good one at that.\nChinese people know their own history, they know this is not some dude you just come across on the street. This is a talent in a generation. And given the right time, he leads people out of the darkness. That’s why he was called by the old folks “the Red Sun”.\nIn the old dynasty of China, every emperor has a honorary name after his demise. And you can’t cheat that. Think Richard the Lionheart or John the Lackland, this will be how you are remembered. And for Mao, how would he like to be remembered?\nThe official sentence is 70% good and 30% bad. I think that’s fair enough, for any human that ever lived, not to mention for the guy who if he wants to, can command 500 million people to go to hell or high water with him. Can you say that Napolean? or Ghandi? or MLK? People always say: with great power, comes great responsibility. The truth is, with great power, I will be grateful if he’s tried his best.\nThe lesson to learn here is that, with life, you don’t get 100%. With history, same thing, some people hate you, some people love you. but more will remember you. 70% is good enough.",
      "3": "I’m a Chinese. Normally I don’t talk about Mao with non-Chinese, especially westerners, not because I may annoy them, but the opposite. It’s like an Eskimo listening to an Equator man talk about ice and snow, blahblahblah, “humph, you think you know!”\n(I’m just told a story by a Chinese fellow. His boss, an American, in a restaurant, darted a scornful glance at the Mao picture on the wall and asked an employee next to him: what do you think of him? “A great man”. Then the next day this employee got fired.)\nMao is a great man, even the greatest one can ever know. In my twenties, I hated him so bitterly that I wanted him to die the second time, to be torn to pieces or whatever. Now I don’t think so any more. His greatness is still great, his badness is still bad. I accept both.\nI could have written more, but it would be too long. Sorry have to give up.",
      "4": "Mao wasn't tasked with building a prosperous China. He was tasked with dismantling the old system simple as that. Cos Chinese theoreticians opined that unless old system is dismantled, nothing will get done.\nHere is example of dismantling old system.\nWithout Maoist social reforms , if Deng tried his Liberalization, thr result would be India part 2.\nSo in traditional Chinese political thinker circles ,.Mao is sort of seen as a prerequisite to Deng. That WITHOUT a nastik society that is scientifically tempered, opening the economy is bakwas cos in such societies, folks will say “sab oppar wallah dek lega\" or “this life is only a mere test. Brahma has readied moksha for me in round 2!” and economy will go to speculators and swindlers just as it happened here.\nSo Mao was basically tasked withith getting rid of fatism among all aspects of Chinese culture and bringing fundamental changes in how people think. If u chatted up a pre Maoist Chinese, u will hear them go on and on about the next life , about divine jusrice etc but this dunya k ma ki ?? But if u chat up a modern-day Chinese, he will talk mostly about money and career , the mark of an enlightened man.\nMao also removed naitekitavaad or social conservatism from China with an iron hand and boy I'm ever so greatful to him for that each time I visit China !!",
      "5": "The official view is that Mao is 70 percent good and 30 percent bad which works for most people.\nIncreasingly arguing about Mao is like Americans arguing about Franklin Roosevelt or Harry S Truman. He is important but he is fading into history.\nOne odd thing is that it's pretty obvious that one person that dislikes Mao a lot is Xi Jinping. It's so obvious that he disliked Mao that when he first took power he had to assure the Maoists that he wasn't anti Mao, but now his power is secure he does not have to pretend as much.\nThe fact that Xi doesn't like Mao is less polarizing then you might think because none of the other top leadership like Mao either.\nAlso it turns out that I absolute hate Mao, and think he is a homicidal maniac that China would have been better off without. I’ve gotten into some pretty major arguments with fans of Mao Zedong. However, this is starting to become an academic argument with less and less current relevance.",
      "6": "I´m from Hunan, the home province of Mao, so I´m not exactly impartial.\nWhere I grew up, Mao is remembered and celebrated pretty much like Jesus Christ like what I observed in the US, though we don´t specifically try to remember him on Sundays, but some of us still keep a big picture of him at the entrance of our homes.",

She was a doctor, and she and her family were quite comfortable.\nShe had a very expensive looking, maybe even bespoke, ceramic bust of Mao in her living room.\nIt’s anecdotal, but it also was not a bust of Chiang Kai-shek. It was a mark of respect, even reverence, toward The Helmsman.\nBased on other comments I see here, I think it’s safe to extrapolate.

I have had no Chinese friend who fully condemned him, most definitely acknowledge his role in 49 (and before they GLF).\nHowever, the best account of this exact question that I know of, written by a Westerner, can be found on Paul Theroux's excellent Riding the Iron Rooster.\nIn this fantastic book he rides trains all over China before 89 and goes to the museum in the city Mao was born.\nVery interesting episode. I won't tell you what happens ;)\nThe reason I think this particular part of the book really reflects the opinion of a very interesting generation of Chinese people who lived through Mao is because it was sufficiently far away from 76 when Mao died and the episode in 89 had not happened yet but at the same time Dengs reforms already had a lot of momentum so there was this amazing electricity in the air and people could definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel while at the same time reflect on all the pain in the previous decades.

      "17": "It is true that Mao is a very polarizing figure amongst the people in mainland China.\nThere are already a lot of good answers. I will just put some quantitative number as supplemental materials:\nMy college classmate WeChat group has about 90 people. About 10 of them absolutely hate Mao. For those 10, they all have close relatives who suffered a lot under Mao’s rule. About 3 are great fans of Mao. The remaining are kind of neutral. There used to be heated arguments about Mao every years during Mao’s birthday, 12/26. The haters usually won the debate. The fans felt they were abused and 2 of them just left the group. The one remaining fan don’t want to bring the topic up anymore.\nMy high school classmate WeChat group used to have about 150 people. Close to 8 hate Mao, close to 10 are fervent Mao fans. Again, there used be online debates among those groups every year around Mao’s birthday. The debates were much more nasty and personal than the college group. The haters usually have higher educations than the fans, so they ended up winning the debate more frequently than the fans. The fans finally left the group and formed its own group. There were about 100 people remaining in the original group.\nBased on the above sampling, there are about 8% haters, and 5% fans. The remaining are neutral. There seems to be more on negative side than on the positive side.\nThere are quite a few classmates who do not think Mao did anything good. One joke among them are: “I used to hate Chiang Kai-shiek (because I was taught to hate him), after studying history more, I hate Chiang Kai-shiek more (because he let Mao succeeded)”\nFull Disclosure: I don’t like Mao at all. But I don think I am a hater. He would be remembered favorably if he retired or died before 1957. He just stayed too long on the top and wore out of his luck.",

      "12": "Well, the debate between whether an apple (fruit) is a necessity or luxury can be quite interesting. Let's dive into it and explore the different aspects of this question.\nFirst of all, when we talk about necessities and luxuries, we should be aware of their definitions:\nNecessity: Something essential for a person's well-being or required to fulfill basic needs.\nLuxury: An item or service that is desirable but not essential, often associated with higher costs and quality.\nNow, let's take a look at apples and their role in our daily lives:\nHealth benefits: Apples are packed with essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These nutrients play a significant role in promoting overall health and well-being. They can also help in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, like heart disease and diabetes.\nAffordability: Apples are generally considered affordable and widely available in most parts of the world. They can be found in various varieties, which may differ in price, but are usually within reach for the majority of people.\nVersatility: Apples can be consumed in various ways – eaten raw, cooked, or even processed into various products like apple juice, cider, and applesauce. This versatility makes them a popular choice for many people.\nCultural significance: Apples have been a part of human history for thousands of years, and they hold cultural significance in various societies. For example, apples are often associated with good health, knowledge, and wisdom.\nConsidering these factors, it's clear that apples offer numerous health benefits, making them an important part of a balanced diet.\nHowever, they're not necessarily a \"necessity\" in the strictest sense, as one can still maintain a healthy diet without them. On the other hand, apples are not a luxury item either, given their affordability and widespread availability.\nIn some cases, specific varieties of apples or apple products may be considered a luxury due to their higher price or unique characteristics. For instance, certain high-end apple varieties from Japan have been known to sell for exorbitant prices. However, these cases are the exception rather than the rule.\nIn conclusion, apples can be seen as a valuable addition to a healthy diet but are not necessarily a necessity or luxury in general. They offer numerous health benefits and are widely available at affordable prices, making them a popular and versatile choice for many people.",

      "15": "Apple fruit can be considered both a necessity and a luxury depending on the context and individual circumstances.\nFrom a nutritional perspective, apples can be a necessity as they are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants that are important for maintaining good health. Eating apples regularly can help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.\nOn the other hand, apples can also be considered a luxury as they are not always affordable or accessible for everyone. In some regions or countries, apples may be considered an exotic or imported fruit that is only available at a premium price. This can make it difficult for people with lower incomes or in food-insecure areas to include apples in their regular diet.\nIn some cases, apples may also be considered a luxury in terms of their taste and quality. Premium varieties such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady apples can be more expensive than other varieties and are often sought after for their superior taste and texture.\nOverall, whether apples are considered a necessity or a luxury depends on the context and individual circumstances.

In this sense, apples could be viewed as a necessity for maintaining good health.\nHowever, in the context of affordability and availability, the perception of apples as a necessity or luxury may vary. In some regions or countries, apples may be more accessible and affordable, making them a commonly consumed fruit and therefore considered a necessity. In other areas or for individuals with limited resources, the cost of apples or their relative scarcity might make them less accessible, and thus they could be viewed as more of a luxury.\nIt's important to note that the classification of a food item as a necessity or luxury can also be influenced by factors such as cultural values, personal preferences, and individual circumstances."

NSA sex with other people without Jealousy or anger involved, you get other men and he gets other women and it's consensual.\nWhen couples start realise that the people they are with aren't possessions but in fact another person they chose to walk the walk of life with. If having non monogamus sex means making that walk easier and the relationship stronger then it may be the only way forward to save the marriage.",
      "2": "What you are actually talking about is an open relationship. It is only cheating if he doesn’t know about it. If you lie to him. Both are very dangerous and considered infidelity.\nMy second marriage was an open marriage and I discovered that it is just as dangerous to a relationship as sneaking around. People get attached to one another that they aren’t married to and end up leaving one for the other. Within the two years that I was in the “lifestyle” I saw four marriages go up in smoke. The last one being my own. It rarely works out.",
      "3": "My friend found out he was being cheated on by his wife several years ago.\nShe pleaded to be forgiven, and promised it would never happen again.\nAfter a day or two to think about it, I thought my friends decision was genius. He didn’t want a divorce either, especially with kids involved. His decision was this: He would take her back as long as she would sign a legal document drawn by his lawyer that stated if she was ever got caught cheating again, she would agree to NO claim on any marital assets and and agree to NO spousal support. In other words, if she cheated again, HE would get everything. My friend is somewhat “well off”, so this could stand to be a significant amount.\nIn the end, she showed her true colors. She would not agree to the terms of his offer and they ended in divorce.",
      "4": "It's viscous cycle. Nothing is going to be the same again. For one, if you're not the type who cheats, you're NEVER gonna get that sense of “we're even.” You would feel like you scored merely a 5 over 100, but now have to deal with the inferiority complex that comes from wondering if the other person your spouse cheated with is finer, sexier, bigger, better in the sac, in better shape, etc than you. The mental torture will kill you. On the other hand, if cheating was lying latent in you, you would have woken up a sleep dog — a nasty bitch. Once you get a taste of another while married, your sexual appetite is permanently reconfigured. You may always want more, and variety. There goes the whole sanctity of your marriage. The possible outcomes are numerous. You would only have to wait and see how your situation turns out. My advise: cheat only if it's what you have always wanted to do, and not because you want to get even. It will be akin to stealing because someone stole from you. Are you a thief? No? Don't steal. Are you an adulteress? No? Don't commit.",
      "5": "Marriage is a sacred vow. Cheating means you have no respect for your partner and it should be end of marriage. If you enjoy having an open relationship to get even with your partner then you are only demeaning your moral values to be just like him with no self worth. I would leave him, move on and find a better partner who will give you security and true love. When someone truly loves you they will find it difficult to hurt you or cheat on you no matter what the circumstances. Don’t follow the steps of someone malicious and with no value. Be better, find better.",
      "6": "My wife cheated on me with her boss. She had a 5 month affair with him. Shortly after we separated. We were apart for almost two years. I met someone new and fell in love with her. When we decided to finally get a divorce I got cold feet and felt like I truly never gave her a chance to explain herself or see if it could ever work again. Stupidity kicked in and I left and hurt a really wonderful person for the wife that strayed on me. We moved back in together and it has not been good. Her affair destroyed the way I felt about her. She is no longer the woman I adored. Some say a marriage can be stronger after an affair. I highly disagree.",
      "7": "Here is My advice, Not that you asked. I had three wives that cheated. The first invited Friends into our bed to compensate for the offense and then tried to use it against me in our custody hearing. The Lawyer asked me “Why did you allow Two 18-year-olds into your bed?” ( I was 19 ) My reply “You are kidding right, That’s every 19-year-old Dream come true!” He looked at the Judge and the Judge shrugged and said, “ You asked the question”\nMy second wife didn’t like sharing; I did it anyway. She didn’t know until a counseling session. She learned what it feels like to learn what broken Trust feels Like. (refer to how I wiped a smirk off someone’s face! in my ans questions for that tale)\nThe third I never cheated on her. She cheated and Left.\nSo, toots if you want to cheat go ahead but get your duck in a row. File for divorce first, Move as much money as you can, and if you have a house get him to sign a quit claim deed and file it soon. Do this with the car too. All of these things were done to me and they stick.\nHave fun ruining several Lives. Be a Melonhead.",

      "11": "And what would cheating back do for you, make you feel better… right the wrong? What is loyalty? Is tolerating bs what marriage is all about these days? I say both of you are married but neither of you are marriage material. How could you fix your mouth to say that to someone you vowed your loyalty? How could he insert himself into someone outside of the one he devoted himself to? GOOD GRIEF!! Both of you are a joke and you’re mocking God by treating each other so disrespectfully.

      "13": "That’s a stupid response. It puts you at his low life level. Personally I was married 21 years to a cheater. I sincerely don’t understand how a person can go around having intimate sex with just anyone. If what he did was gamble your saving away would you tell him you’d go to the casino and gamble anything left just to make a point before you took him back? Keep your pride girl and either work through your pain or divorce.",
      "14": "So here's the problem. If you're the kind of person who would never have cheated on your partner in the first place you're actually compromising your own values just to get revenge. Two wrongs don't make a right. Nothing good will come from compromising yourself just to make a point.\nHaving done this it's very likely that at some point you gonna look at yourself in the mirror and hate yourself for what you've done.\nPlus this will do nothing to improve the level of trust that now exists between you and your betraying partner. Your partner will assume that you feel entitled to cheat on him anytime you like now, because of his error. This will erode the trust further between you. Incidentally, it's not as easy as you think, to go out and find someone to shag, if it's (morally) not the kind of thing you would do.\nAlso you're not fixing any problems here, the real underlying issue still exists; but the only thing you're doing is changing the nature of your relationship. You're changing your relationship into a tit-for-tat situation: he cheats, you cheat, he cheats, you cheat, he cheats…. Don't be surprised if it deteriorates into a vicious malignant cycle. Because it definitely won't solve the problem.",

If you “cheat” he will know it’s coming, which is very different than what he did to you. I’d recommend having some kind of open relationship and set the guidelines for truthfulness (what do you have to tell each other). Dishonesty can impact more than just the sexual/emotional part of your relationship, so whatever you do, make sure that is addressed first and foremost.\nPS: Sleeping with someone else probably will make you feel better, yes, but having the conversation about truthfulness hopefully will lead to honesty from now on.",

I'd say start marriage counseling cause he definitely needs it and if he's truly sorry he will work on himself and gain your trust again.

Therefore, he can call you out as a cheater whenever he likes. You will be no different than him. And two wrongs NEVER make a right.\nIf you cheat on him, it will mark the beginning of an open season for him to cheat on you at will.

So, I started looking at very graphic pictures and videos of guys. It honestly made me feel better in doing so just to “get back at him” because it did hurt him. But one thing it did NOT do was fill that hole in my heart from the betrayal trauma he had given me. So, we sought out therapy and it has helped us tremendously.

If you move to Vietnam or Africa, there is a decent chance that the factory that is manufacturing your stuff is Chinese owned and you will be using Chinese trucks or Chinese trains to move your stuff in Chinese rails through Chinese ports on Chinese ships.\nOnce you have rich Africans, they will be buying Chinese cell phones and solar panels.\nSo moving manufacturing to Africa won't hurt China.",
      "2": "BEIJING: Go ahead if you are a manufacturer prepared to open a new factory in Africa. China is not forbidding any company from doing so. But the sole motive to curtail the rise of China seems foolish. Why not go to Africa just to make money there?\nIn most instances, businesses have the greatest concern over the profit motive. Accordingly, opening a factory in Africa comes with risks and the same can be said for China or setting up manufacturing anywhere else in the world.\nThe continent of Africa is a land rich in natural resources with a young and growing population. Land prices and labor wages are significantly lower in African nations than in most parts of China.\nBut, Africa continues to deal with rampant corruption, social instabilities, widespread civil wars and violence, as well as poor infrastructure and low urbanization scales.\nHence, securing a reliable and efficient supply chain can be very costly and lead to numerous delays on production lines and delivering goods to buyers on the continent.\nNevertheless, Beijing still eyes great potential for the African business community since the African Union and China remain key players in the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI).\nChina has pledged to sign joint projects with African governments to build major infrastructure, such as roads, railroads, power plants, and upgrading shipping ports along with expanding industrial and office parks.\nAccordingly, Chinese companies and investors are looking to strengthen supply chains and to increase efficiency and delivery times via logistics services in the African continent.\nSo foreign-based companies with plans to open up new factories in Africa can give thanks to China for helping the continent’s rapid development including industrialization, urbanization and modernization drives.\nWashington has not always acted in the best interests of African businesses either. A few months ago, the US government demanded Ethiopia place tougher restrictions on Chinese investments in the country but betrayed Addis Adaba later on when announcing economic sanctions against them.\nThe erratic behavior of US foreign policy will cause more harm than good in Africa. Washington insists on all African governments complying with pro-Western human rights but such expectations are impractical.\nAfrica is not the West and Africans are not the same as the Americans. Africans follow different customs, traditions and as such they have different national conditions and they prefer to take charge over their own affairs.\nBeijing recognizes the rights to sovereignty of African governments and prefers to focus on economic cooperation, trade and investment ties with them.\nThe Chinese government does not intend to deliver pompous lectures to Africans about how they should govern themselves.\nChina has also defended Ethiopia as they must confront sanctions. We can read more about it from Xinhua. The link is here:\nhttp://www.news.cn/english/2021-09/22/c_1310203062.htm \nAs reported by Xinhua:\n“China opposes the new round of sanctions imposed by the United States on Ethiopia, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Wednesday.\nZhao made the remarks at a press briefing in response to a query on an executive order signed by U.S. President Joe Biden authorizing a new round of sanctions against Ethiopia due to conflict inside the country.\nZhao said that China always holds that international law and basic norms governing international relations must be adhered to in state-to-state relations. China opposes wanton pressure through sanctions or the threat of imposing sanctions to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Zhao added.”\nThe Quora question is strange and not sure why it was asked, considering how China holds deep connections with the African business community.\nWeChat: 86 13439758718",
      "3": "By all means, do so. Help to develop Africa and improve the economy of the people there.\nChina is doing just that. There are at least 10,000 Chinese owned businesses in Africa, with about 180,000 Chinese nationals working there. They have helped many Africans to get jobs.",
      "4": "Who are you? And who are “we”?\nI presume that you are an American.\nYour “we” is delusional because your “we” had no powers as you believed that your “we” could just do what is logical.\nNo! Your thoughts had not been consistent with your country's liberalism. Your thoughts could be possible only if your country is willing to admit having had wrongly embraced liberalism and to at least switch to semi-controlled econo-governance.\nUnder liberalism, capitalists had no sense of nationalism and would only seek to improve their bottom lines and would go where their bottom lines is expected to increase.\nAs at the present, your “we” had no powers to dictate how and where should your capitalists do/go, your “we” simply had no controls of the capitalists, they are the ones that had been controlling your “we”.\nGood luck to you and “we”.",
      "5": "Who is “we”?\nDo you assume that we are some sort of communist nation where the state controls the means of production and is in a position to dictate where companies manufacture goods?\nHow do “we” transfer manufacturing from China to Africa? What manufacturing do “we” even control?\nThe United States, for example, has become a pitiful shell in terms of manufacturing. We’ve pretty much given up the game to the Chinese and our phony right wing is determined to ensure Chinese domination for the foreseeable future. The Chinese build up their nation while their empty-headed American pawns of the Trump persuasion do everything they can to destroy ours. No infrastructure, no education, no health care, no modern nation, no rule of law. Just an American Taliban rooted in the dark ages.",
      "6": "Transferring manufacturing is not all that simple. You need huuuge infrastructure, skilled personnel, motivated governance, and availability of the materials, electricity, Gas, water, and developed land. AND of course available markets.\nChina was favored by USA , to provide unlimited unrestricted, untaxed markets- for a Long Period. USA infused almost 600 billion dollars a year for 20 years into China, as trade surplus favoring China. These 12 Trillion dollars trade surplus.built the Chinese people, plants, infrastructure, schools, and colleges, power plants, etc etc in China. So now China has a developed economy based on inexpensive Manufacturing.\nA more practical approach would be to translate manufacturing to INDIA, Indo China, Ceylon( Srilanka), etc where skilled labor is available. But these countries have to progress and improve the way governments operate, need cut red tape, and eliminate corruption. They also have to rein in the Trade Unions dictating or interfering in good management.\ni have a few lists where India needs to improve:\n1.0 Any export oriented company should be allowed to register a company in 3 days.( just as in USA).\n2.0 All imports and exports should be completely free of any controls.\n3.0 Power,Gas,and water connection should be available without bribes .\n4.0 Any officer causing any obstruction or delay should be removed from office. They are supposed to be facilitating and not obstructionist\n5.0 Check the net worth of all officers in power, and if it is not in commensurate with their salaries, send them to jail.\n6.0 There should be a separate ministry for Make in India. The officers should be paid for their achievement and not for ‘ being in office’\n7.0 Get rid of ALL red tape. No need of any restrictions, and loads of paperwork. The business persons should be free to import and export without any demur or delays. They must bring in positive foreign exchange.\n8.0 If a foreigner shall supply ALL his foreign exchange needs from their sources, no need for any import or export regulations. The tax rate should be comparable to tax in USA.\n9.0 Tax Policy: No import or export taxes. No corporate tax for 5 years.\n10.0 The labor can not go on strikes. Minimum wage shall be $ 1 per hour. which is much higher than minimum wages stated by the GOI. So no need of collective bargaining.Also employment shall be At Will. (As in USA).\nMovement of traffic, and Materials: interstate commerce should be strictly enforced.\nThe people should be put to work, by expanding manufacturing. All these stupid movements ( sitting down doing nothing), should be handled strictly and swiftly.\nAlso terrorism, illegal activities should be crushed. So people are fearless, Happy and productive work.",

      "8": "I would like to take some of the credit for China’s development.\nI worked there for many years.\nMy latest kitchen appliance purchase was a citrus juicer, “Made in China”. When I left China I brought back with me a “soy milk” machine.\nMy hope is that each of the workers involved in the production process were paid regularly, and on time, and that their work was not hazardous.\nI do not know the origin of the capital that was used to set up the factory and supply and distribution network, nor the nationality of those involved.\nIf investors or potential investors see Africa as a suitable place to invest then they will doubtless conduct their own feasibility study.\nIt is useful to distinguish between people, nationality and political party.\nThanks for asking.",
      "9": "You may not know this but both China and Africa are free to sell their manufactured good in America. American companies choose Chinese goods because they are high quality and low in cost. This allows companies to make greater profits and still have satisfied customers.\nChina is also way ahead of other countries when it comes to infrastructure, manufacturing, and other systems necessary to produce and deliver goods and services.\nFor 5 thousand years China was the country all other countries desperately wanted to trade with. America was discovered by Europeans desperately looking for alternate trader routes to China no matter how long or difficult the journey. China is poised to come back stronger than ever and you are not only wrong but you go against history to even try to curb China’s right to develop its economy.",

      "11": "“China designed and executed a policy that shrank the industrialization process in a mere 25 years\n— something that many economies took at least a century to do. That redesign has brought immense dislocation in global commerce and industry, enabling China to become one of the world’s leading economies.\nChina’s success has led many African capitals\nto pursue the country’s same industrialization trajectory. Over the last few years, African leaders have been pursuing policies\ndesigned to mimic the path China took. Some of these policies include creating special economic zones after China’s Shenzhen and positioning the manufacturing sector as a fulcrum to attract investments and create new jobs. Despite these efforts, Africa has yet to advance in its industrialization at the same speed China did.” - Why Africa’s Industrialization Won’t Look Like China’s\nHarvard Business Review.\nChina is already transferring manufacturing to China, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc., etc.",

      "13": "Africa does not have skilled workers or machines to do any manufacturing. And then again, it is nobody’s objective to curb China’s development.\nBut there are a small number of people who drink cheap beer to imagine that they can curb China. They should probably try Chinese beer to get their thinking right. Those who smoke may even try Doubla Happiness, a Chinese brand cigarette to get the high spirits. This cigarette is cheap.",
      "14": "Question: Shouldn't we transfer manufacturing to Africa rather than China in order to curb China's development?\nAnswer:\nChinese fixed capital asset investment is about 96% domestic last time I checked (which is around 2018). And majority of those 4% is from Hong Kong.\nSo who is “we” that can order around Chinese domestic investment? (Which a lot of them comes from the Chinese government.)\nEarly 2020 there were a lot of screams about moving things out of China, but then by the end of 2020, China overtook US as the top destination of FDI. It turned out that having a competent government that can quickly deal with disasters such as pandemic and flood is very attractive to international investors.",
      "15": "Shouldn't we transfer manufacturing to Africa rather than China in order to curb China's development?\nChina is transferring manufacturing to Africa rather than China right now. In fact, China has been doing so for the last five years at least, maybe ten. It's called the Belt and Road Initiative and decried by western media as “neo colonialism” and “debt traps”.\nParts of China have become developed enough that it is no longer cost efficient to manufacture goods there. So, Chinese companies move production out of China and go to where the labour is cheaper. Build factories and employ locals who can be paid a lower wage, build roads and railways and ports so the goods they manufacture can be conveniently and quickly transported around the world.\nChina is doing exactly what the OP is suggesting. I'll admit, it would be entertaining to see what kind of audacious lies anti-China hypocrites come up with to justify why their actions are noble when they're doing the exact same actions they called China evil for doing, but on the whole, it's a waste of time to bother with anything those racist failures say anymore.",

      "20": "There is not much transferring to China anymore. There is more moving out production by both Chinese and other companies to where production is cheaper. It's part of of liberal capitalism. It won't curb China's development thou as Chinese companies will also earn more from it",

Why are they still there, in China?\nIn fact and to your disappointment, they're moving the manufactures back to China, why, go figure!!!",
      "23": "I don't think we should curb China's development. But manufacturing for US good is rapidly shift ing to other countries (like Vietnam and Mexico) as our countries decouple their economies\nAfrica is not presently able to deliver much manufacturing capacity on terms that interest US companies. That will change in Africa's favor over time. The key priority is stability, which most African countries do not have enough of. (Rule of law would be second. US laws heavily penalize bribes, which are necessary in many otherwise attractive African markets).",
      "24": "Of course not, this is such a narrow-minded idea.\nWhy would you want to curb China? Only US will afraid that, because they will lost power to rob the world.\nAnd on the other hand, it is not that you could decide where is the best place for manufacturing. The market will make their own choice, and China is the selected one, due to their stable and hightly efficent systme, strong economy , skilled people , highly developed logistic & transportation system, and highly developed supplychain. Africa has long way before achieving that, although China is working hard to help Africa to improve that.",
      "25": "First Point:\nCOVID-19\nChina recovered very quickly and their economy was left largely intact. Manufacturers are reluctant to move to places such as India who has struggled to deal with the outbreak. Same with many other places including Africa. The virus will continue to rampage across the world, especially in more vulnerable places. Eventually will circulate like the seasonal flu.\nSecond Point:\nSupply Chains\nChina has been developed for decades. They have a robust and ready supply chain. For example: a car door being manufactured in factory A can easily be shipped off to factory B where it’s assembled onto the car all within the same country, China. If manufacturing were to diversify to like Vietnam and India, then the shipping and transport costs between the two nations will cause the price of product to rise. So it’s still technically still cheaper to be produced in China, despite rising wages.\nThird Point:\nUnderdevelopment\nAfrica is underdeveloped. Western investors will have to re-invest billions of dollars onto the continent just to get manufacturing started. Then hire millions of new skilled workers and plus initial inefficiency. Too costly to re-train everyone, China has it all.\nFourth Point:\nSystemic Reasonings\nSub-Saharan Africa is designed to be raw materials exporter. That’s why Africa hasn’t developed or got high industrialization for centuries now. European colonisation basically restructured the entirety of the continent into a raw materials exporter. That’s how Europe fuelled their industrial revolution, what fuelled Asian Tigers, and now China. All cheap resources come from this continent.\nWe must keep the costs low here to keep the capitalist machine going.\nAfrica produce materials -> China makes the product -> consumed by developed countries. Other nations are all stuck in middle income trap, they can’t develop into rich nation, so stuck in the middle. They do both export materials but also consume goods and services.\nConclusion\nUltimately China will slowly transition to producing high tech goods, as outlined by the CPC. Cheap products manufacturing will inevitably go to India and other developing nations.\nBut the idea that China will collapse due to losing manufacturing is stupid. It’s an inevitable transition, been happening for a while now. Just more noticeable because Western media is picking it up for anti-China talking point, and it’s a serious goal of the CPC’s next 5 and 10 year plans.",

Do you even think that it is possible?\nI’m sure that there would be several countries in Africa which would welcome investment in their manufacturing sectors. But there is no compelling case for them to favour non-Chinese investment over Chinese investment.\nWestern investors have extracted a lot of wealth from African countries over the years. Where’s the development return for these countries so far?\nThe occidental manipulation of the global economy for the purposes of exploiting the nations of Asia and the Global South is coming to an end.

      "31": "What ought to be ≠ what is.\nThere’s more to the supply chain than just labour, raw materials, and the factories…\nOn top of this, the country’s law, governance, and economic system all need to accommodate for the global supply chain. Production consumes a huge amount of water and energy, creating pollution as a byproduct, which requires further management. Shipping and transporting goods to your ports also take up a lot of fuel, vehicles, and road infrastructure. All this requires heavy investment.\nSo companies can choose to make their stuff in China right now—where viability and feasibility are proven—or try their luck in an uncharted territory for production—which only makes up a part of their business model.\nOn labour, the population distribution in Africa is more scattered compared to the coastline of Asia. Looking at this map, you can see the viable coastal cities narrow to Cairo, Lagos, Casablanca, and Cape Town, and perhaps Dar es Salaam.\nCompare this to the Indo-Pacific region, where there’s a slew of manufacture hubs and infrastructure supporting exporting concentrated in one region, overlapping with the world’s largest population density.\nAny of the African locations I listed above suffer from the fact that there are fewer customers they can sell to in their own region.\nIt just doesn’t make sense for your cargo ships to take the Cape Route when the Suez Canal exists, unless you also need to stop by and sell to your neighbours along the route. Keep in mind that cargo ships visit multiple locations.\nBecause most of the world’s maritime trade go to the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic region, exporting from African ports mean it is closer to the Atlantic market but too far from the Pacific one. So the theoretical construction of the next “World’s Factory” in Africa is not only slow and costly but also uncompetitive.",
      "32": "It is not advisable to transfer manufacturing from China to Africa with the aim of curbing China's development. Such a policy would not only be impractical but could also be counterproductive, as it could potentially harm both China and Africa.\nFirstly, China has developed a highly advanced manufacturing infrastructure that has taken many years and significant investment to build. While Africa has great potential as a manufacturing hub, it would take significant investment and time to develop a similar level of infrastructure. Additionally, Africa faces a range of challenges that could make it difficult to establish a manufacturing base, such as a lack of reliable electricity, poor transport infrastructure, and limited access to financing.\nFurthermore, transferring manufacturing from China to Africa could potentially harm China's economy, as many of its businesses and industries rely heavily on manufacturing for their growth and profitability. In addition, transferring manufacturing to Africa could lead to job losses in China, which could create social and economic instability.\nInstead of focusing on transferring manufacturing from China to Africa, efforts should be made to promote sustainable and equitable development in both regions. This could include initiatives to promote fair trade, support entrepreneurship and small businesses, and encourage investment in infrastructure and education. Such efforts could help to create a more balanced and sustainable global economy, while also promoting economic and social development in both China and Africa.",
      "33": "Rather than viewing manufacturing as a competition between regions, we should encourage global collaboration. China and Africa can complement each other's strengths, fostering mutually beneficial partnerships. By leveraging expertise, resources, and knowledge-sharing, both regions can thrive, creating a win-win scenario for all parties involved.",
      "34": "Except, we Africans don't want the manufacturing version of China. We want high tech manufacturing where Africans are not exposed to the conditions of Chinese factory workers.

It’s not just the evangelicals or the Trump cult of stupids either you can’t call yourself a christian and a republican/conservative and or maga at the same time. They are wholly incompatible. Even in its pre-batshit days everything that party stands for is the exact opposite of the teachings of Christ full stop. So if you proudly call yourself an American conservative Christian you are simply announcing to the world that you don’t take your religion seriously either and it’s just an excuse to hopefully get your persecution/controlling fix.",
      "14": "I am an atheist, like the majority of the French, but Catholics are by far the main religious minority.\nLike most of the French think that Trump is terrible, should be in prison, and do not see him as Christian, it is more than doubtful that catholics ever consider him as the main Christian figure in the world.\nAnyway, for Christians, nobody can replace Jesus Christ, even the best Christian on earth.\nAre you trolling?",

      "16": "There is little to no evidence Trump is even Christian. I will stop short on judging his faith, but Trump hasn't been in and out of churches his whole life. And it's not like he's one of those people that quietly goes to church or prays alone in a garden. Maybe he is, I don't know, but I've never seen him even enter church premises.\nTrump has been married and lied far too many times to ever be Catholic. He has mistreated and misapplied scripture far too many times to sincerely be Protestant. However, if Trump genuinely repents and asks forgiveness and believes in Jesus privately, he may be an independent Christian who is unaffiliated. His actions lead me to say not, but anything is possible.\nAnd while Catholics do believe there are moral grounds for divorce where neither party should be judged, the truth of the matter is that Trump gets a new wife every few years and cheats on them. You simply cannot live that sort of life and be a Christian. You either remain single and repent or get married and stay committed. Either way, marriage is a covenant between you and God if you are a Christian. If you openly show contempt for marriage (i.e. cheat on your wife/husband repeatedly), that is a sin in God's eye.\nHowever, your question brings a very unique problem to the table. You are replacing Jesus with Donald Trump. If we apply that to either Catholic or most Protestant theology, that would make him a false prophet. In other words, a false prophet is someone who promises great things and miracles, but brings with him/her only destruction.\nIn Trump's case, it is not difficult to see he is a false prohpet. Many people on January 6th believed they were doing the right thing, even though they had killed a police officer, injured another, and led another to suicide. The fruit of that tree is extremely poisonous, and any Christian is asked to judge the man by the changes and people he/she influences. So, keep in mind for many Christians, Trump's presidency is a reminder that Jesus will return one day and bring better days to the true of heart.\nI will stop short of calling him anti-Christian because I don't know if the evidence goes there. However, there is evidence he's a false prophet, and there has been a lot of them throughout history. What did he tell you? I alone can fix it. Nobody has that authority except God in Christian tradition. Anti-semitism and anti-Asian hatred also rose drastically under his term, and it is clear that Jesus loves everyone. This is again evidence that Trump is not following the teachings of any church. So to answer your question politely, Trump does not fit nicely in any church found in the US. Keep in mind you can be in a church and just agree with most of its major teachings. You cannot be in a church and disrespect your traditions however, as that is the terms you enter as a person of faith.\nThis is my interpretation and answer to your question based on scripture. For all relevant references read Matthew, Revelation, Genesis, and Ephesians. While I answered with a Christian perspective, there are bound to be non-Christian perspectives that see issues in a similar light of course with some theological differences.",

      "4": "Soviet soldiers were all too keen to share food and drink with the prisoners they liberated from the Nazi occupiers. As for atrocious report by Nikolai Politanov, one of the first Red Army soldiers and translator who entered Auschwitz Here's a full report of the liberation.\nI was a translator at the front. Our forces had taken half of Poland. At New Years we reached Krakow. I interrogated German and Italian officers there, because I knew Italian and Polish besides Russian. I’ve learnt that from my mother and during school. We then got the order to push beyond the town and into the concentration camp Auschwitz. When our tanks reached the front gates of the KZ [KZ = Konzentrationslager; German for concentration camp] early on the 27th of january 1945, the guards had already caught wind and had fled. Only some remained, others had died by their own hands.\nNobody resisted. The front gate of the camp was locked. Our tank broke through. One truck after the other, full of soldiers, drove onto the camp site. Our soliders disembarked, disarmed the remaining guards of the camp and arrested them.\nSo we drove up to the extermination camp Birkenau.\nKnowing the Red Army was closing in, the SS gave the boilermen (?) [people operating the ovens] the order, to throw the prisoners, who were already emaciated to the point of looking like skeleton, into the crematorium alive. They wanted to get rid of the sick and weakened to cover up their tracks as fast as possible.\nThe boilermen looked surprised to see us officers and soldiers. They were strong people, mostly Kapos [prisoners forced to work in the camps]. They greeted us with shy smiles on their faces, a mix of happiness and fear. Like on command, they threw away their poker. With us, they talked freely. Angry words about Hitler were spoken. I still remember an old boilermen stammer “Thank you”. “Thank you, friend. May I call you [the Russians] friends?”.\nOne of them, a Ukrainian, I asked: “Why did you do that?” and pointed towards the ovens. Without blinking he replied: “They didn’t ask if I wanted to. No, I didn’t want to. But better be the guy working the oven, then be the one burning. That’s why I did it.” I was speechless, could just shake my head. “Why aren’t the other ovens burning? There’s no smoke coming up the chimney”, I asked the guy. “Deconstructed”, he said.\nCaught in our own thoughts, everyone just stood around. Nobody cared about the burning ovens. “Stop this. Out! All of you!”, the commanding officer Sergejew shouted. Outside, he was shaking and said with a stuttering voice: “How can this be in the midst of the 20th century! I can’t comprehend this. If there’d be a god, maybe he could explain how this all came to be.”\nWe visited the barracks and couldn’t believe our own eyes. Naked and groaning people, hardly looking like humans, were laying on straw bags. I touched one of the people laying there. He didn’t move. He wasn’t alive anymore.\nIn another barrack, a woman was dying. I asked if someone from her family was also in the camp. She said yes. Via speakers we tried to find her relatives and reunited the family. Shortly after, the woman died, although our doctors tried to save her.\nAfter that we concentrated on the camp headquarters. In the hallway towards the office of the camp management I found a paper pinned to the wall which concerned me, too, since I’m slav. It said something along the lines of “Germans! We are the masters. Our interests are the only that matter. The reproduction of the slav people is not desired. Childlessness and abortian are to be encouraged. Education of slav children is unnecessary. If they can count up to 100, that’s sufficient. Those who can’t work, shall die.”\nI translated the text for the others who just shook their heads. One teared it down. The offices were empty and chaotic so we went outside.\nIn the meantime our soldiers had gathered the female guards and brought them to us. “Should we…?”, asked a Corporal. “No, don’t do anything stupid”, the officer replied. “This is to be decided by the Ordnungstruppe” [something like 'commanding unit' or 'military police' perhaps; definitely a higher authority; can’t find a solid translation;].\n“What does she have in her bag”, I asked another woman, since I saw how filled her bag was. A soldier grabbed into the bag. It was a brochure. The headline was “About the law to defend the hereditary health of the German people”. I took it, read some pages. Proof of being aryan, marriage prohibition, anglo-jewish plague … I took note of it and was shocked. People are still carrying these with them! [Nikolai Politanow is suprised that these people still carry things that will be used as evidence against them.]\n“Are you all Aryan women?”, I asked. They give me a cold look. “I don’t know”, one of them replied. We laughed. “Where are the camp doctors?”, I asked. “Not here, ran off”. “And the male prisoners, where are they? I haven’t seen a single man. What is this all about?”. “A week ago they’ve been escorted out of the camp. Probably relocated to Majdanek or Treblinka”, she replied. I tore the brochure into pieces and threw it onto the piles of garbage.\nUntil evening, many reporters had arrived. Nonstop buzzing and flashing cameras everywhere inside and ouside the barracks. We had to learn one step after the other that Auschwitz was a central selection camp. Jewish people were selected for forced labour or death in the gas chambers. The immediate extermination by jews who were unable to work was expressly insisted upon.\nThe field kitchens arrived soon. Nearly at the same time, the Ordnungstruppe and surprisingly high ranking officers from the staff of Rokossowski and Konjew showed up. Medics distributed sheets and clothing to the prisoners. To prevent the prisoners from eating snow, soldiers distributed tea and bread to the nearly starved skeletons. In the meantime, military trucks had arrived. Around midnight, all prisoners were taken out of the camp. Those still able to walk had no patience to wait and had already taken off by foot towards Sosnowitz. The only remaining people were Kapos and guards. Those were immediatly ordered to dig up mass graves outside the camp and to bury the dead bodies there. Floodlights and generators had already been put in place.\nThe camp was now empty and it was as silent as a monastery. Some torches were lighting the ground here and there. We had to leave, since we are a combat unit assigned to the front. We caught up to the rest of our unit in Sosnowitz, approximatly 15 kilometer east of Kattowitz.\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the Einsatzgruppen, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too.\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\nThe Camps: There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps were later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\nSoviet liberation of Aushwitz",
      "5": "The Russian soldiers were horrified and shocked by the horrors they discovered at Auschwitz. They had heard stories of the Nazi concentration camps, but the reality of the scale of death and suffering they encountered was beyond their imagination. Many soldiers were deeply affected by what they saw, with some reportedly breaking down in tears, while others felt anger and a desire for vengeance against the perpetrators. Some soldiers documented what they saw through photography, and others wrote about their experiences in letters and journal entries. Overall, the liberation of Auschwitz was a traumatic experience for many of the Russian soldiers who participated, and it had a profound impact on their understanding of the atrocities committed during World War Two.",
      "6": "When the Soviet Red Army liberated Auschwitz on January 27, 1945, they were utterly horrified by the scale of atrocities they found. Although they were aware of the Nazi's concentration camps, the extent of the horrors at Auschwitz was beyond their comprehension. They found about 7,000 survivors, most of them severely ill or on the verge of death. When they explored further, they discovered evidence of mass murder - piles of clothes, shoes, eyeglasses, and human hair, gigantic crematoria, and warehouses filled with prisoners' personal possessions.\nThere was an overwhelming sense of disgust, horror, and anger among the liberators. Some of them couldn't believe what they saw and found it difficult to come to terms with the reality of what happened there. Many were motivated to further fight against the Nazi regime, now having witnessed firsthand the extent of the fascist brutalities.\nHowever, the reactions differed from soldier to soldier. Some were so shocked they remained silent for days, while others immediately expressed their feelings of fury and grief. These revelations deeply affected those who liberated Auschwitz, leaving a mark that would last a lifetime.",

The Soviet soldiers who entered the camp were shocked and horrified by the atrocities they witnessed there.\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, the Soviet soldiers who entered Auschwitz were confronted with emaciated prisoners, piles of human ashes, and evidence of systematic torture and murder. Many soldiers were overcome with grief and rage at the sight of the atrocities, and some even took matters into their own hands by seeking revenge against the SS guards and others responsible for the crimes committed at the camp.\nSoviet officials who visited the camp in the weeks following its liberation also expressed shock and outrage at the atrocities they saw there. The Soviet Union played a significant role in documenting the crimes committed at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps, and this documentation would later play a key role in the prosecution of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.\nOverall, the Soviet soldiers who liberated Auschwitz were deeply affected by the horrors they witnessed there, and their experiences helped to shape international understanding of the scale and brutality of the Holocaust.",

The advancing Russian troops didn’t know Auschwitz was in their path and when their forward scouts stumbled across the huge prison complex, they didn't know what it was, but they all soon found out. Though the SS guards had evacuated most of the prisoners, marching them to other camps, and destroyed most of the gas chambers and crematoria, there were still some 10,000 inmates left behind, most of them too sick and weak to move. There was no food or medicine in the place and the prisoners were dying at a high rate. The Soviets brought in what food and supplies they could, while medical personnel attended to the ill.",

      "12": "They didn't show “atrocities” 271.301 people died due to typhus and starvation due to the constant bombing of the allies on the supply routes , Soviets were the ones who actually commit atrocities",
      "13": "Given that the Germans patterned their concentration camps after the Gulags, which had been in existence since the days of the Czars, I seriously doubt the Russians were shocked, or even surprised. Russia is a tough place in every sense of the word."

    "title": "What things cant China manufacture yet still today",
    "answers": {
      "1": "There are two areas of advanced industrial processes that China still fails to master:\nChip Making and Jet Turbine Blades.\nIndeed there are several Chinese-designed Chips, yet to produce them you need one of these:\nIt can easily be argued that this is the most advanced piece of machinery in the world. To function it combines laser, radio and EUV optics, semiconductors, robotics, advanced material engineering, industrial chemistry, applied quantum physics.\nWhile Chinese companies are indeed able to engineer their chip-sets, to manufacture them to the last standards they have to lease the technology from European or American companies. Chinese made machines are still about two generations back.\nThe Chinese aviation industry is indeed making great progress, yet it is nowhere near to be able to manufacture one of these:\nwhich in turn means that their jet engines are at least 20 years behind current GE or Rolls-Royce engines. Indeed China has yet to be able to manufacture a single reliable passenger jet despite purchasing Western Engines and avionics, as the Comac C919 project is still riddled with issues.\nOnce China masters these processes we can definitely state that the “catch-up” phase is complete.",
      "2": "China still has a lot of equipment that can't be made. There is a big gap between China and Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea. For example, a roller coaster.\nChina can't build a roller coaster yet.\nThe five roller coasters in Beijing Happy Valley Theme Park, including the music roller coaster completed in June 5, 19, are not made in China. It's not only Beijing Happy Valley, but also the roller coaster of major theme amusement parks in China. Without Chinese made, it can't be made.\n(roller coaster design is a complex mechanical inertial system) image source: RCD network\nBecause the roller coaster is not actually a chain from the beginning to the end. It is a chain that climbs up and slides along the track to the end. In other words, most of the tracks and cars have no power supply system, all of which are completed by inertia.\nAnother thing I found out is that Switzerland accounts for the majority of the manufacturers of these roller coasters. You are like Beijing Happy Valley phase 5 to be completed large-scale reverse music roller coaster tracks are actually shipped back from abroad, that track is huge, the transportation cost is too terrible.\n(Beijing Happy Valley crystal wings flying roller coaster) source: RCD net\nContinue to add.\nIf you want to know more, please leave a message. I will write a comprehensive article on the backward aspects of China's manufacturing industry",
      "3": "Despite the progress made over the past 50 years in science, technology, space exploration, medicine, AI and robotics; China is stilly sadly lagging behind to the western countries in the following fields:\nFalsifying information and spewing lies to bad-mouth other countries to create divisions, mistrust and conflicts\nFabricating false evidence and presented it to UNSC in order to invade and destroy Iraq, killing close to a million innocent people\nDreaming up an education system and enforcing it to produce young men, women, and tens of other gender identifications who believe they have the RIGHTS TO ALL THINGS BUT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NONE\nEnforcing a genocidal system against blacks and minorities through state apparatus like the police, FBI, INE, ATF, etc\nEnabling and promoting an ever-enlarging wealth gap between the rich and poor, AND then claiming those living in abject poverty were out of choice",
      "4": "A bloody decent sporting gun.\n(A decent sporting gun)\nI’ve touched on China and gun manufacture before. And from my own, personal experience, their rifles and pistols are decent. This should not come as a surprise, as keeping a massive armed force armed, takes some production knowhow.\nBut their People’s Liberation Army does not use double-barrelled shotguns. And the domestic market for those is quite small (taking the size of the country). Sure, there are some Chinese (single-barrelled mostly) shotguns on the market. But these are mostly feeble\nattempts\n. Mostly small tools and machine factories who’re churning out a couple of shotguns on their quiet days.\nIndeed, making a shotgun is not exactly rocket science, there’re gunsmiths in Africa making shotguns\nwith crude tools. But making a decent double-barrelled shotgun is a whole different game. More than great manufacturing machines, you need skilled craftsmen who’re both artists and technicians. These are hard to come by, not only in China, though: save for small independent gunsmiths, the only countries who currently mass-produce very decent double-barrelled sporting guns are Japan, Turkey and Italy.\nEdit: Someone wondered, why should they? Well, if your country is able to fly spaceships, roll out high speed rail and is on the forefront of lot’s of technological innovations, surely, your country’s athletes should be able to rake in the precious metals at the Olympics using your sporting guns.",
      "5": "What things can't China manufacture yet still today?\nWidebody passenger planes. But they’re getting there. According to Wikipedia, Comac is working on the C929 plane together with Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation.\nCRAIC CR929 - Wikipedia\nNarrowbodies, China can and does manufacture them. There are the domestically-built C919 and ARJ21 and Airbus has a factory in Tianjin that assembles A320s. Not sure if that really counts as manufactured in China, but all the parts are put together in China.\nAirbus’ China assembly facility marks 10 years of quality manufacturing for A320 Family jetliners\nIt’s been in operation since 2008. You might have flown on an A320 from there, who knows?",
      "6": "Movies and TV programmes with international appeal and success.\nThere are a few Chinese movies that have been successful internationally but not one the scale of the US movie and TV industry. US blockbusters depend on the Chinese market for their success and they are popular in China.\nThe US have had many decades selling movies and TV programmes to the rest of the world while China has not. Even with the language barrier, American movies and TV programmes are still popular in none English speak countries.",
      "7": "A2A\nAirplane engines…some computer chips, upscale treadmills etc. and anything that is needed in small quantities and which does not make sense producing in China, since the demand is too little.",
      "8": "Slowing but surely China will make everything she needs herself. One of the latest accomplishment is now China can finally make the steel that goes into the ball of the ball point pens. China does not need tons of this steel, the market is very limited, the profit is even more limited, yet China persist until she can make the particular steel herself.",
      "9": "The domestically built aircraft carrier Jiao long entered the sea, the C919 aircraft soared in flight, and the Fu Xing high-speed railway roared to the sea. What else can't be made in China? Or to put it another way, what's wrong with making things in China now?\nAccording to China's list of industrial products dependent on imports, the first weakness is the integrated circuit. The second is high-end equipment, especially high-end power equipment. The third is basic materials, basic components, especially high-end basic materials and basic components.\nWang Xiyan, an expert on China's equipment manufacturing industry, once said, \"It is not terrible to see our weak points, but we should make clear which weak points are restricting the development of our enterprises. I think it is the eve before we break through these weak points, and we need the joint efforts of our country and Chinese entrepreneurs to gather strength and breakthrough these weak points.\"",
      "10": "To sum up this list, I think it may be divided into several aspects. One is that our information and integrated control products are short boards, and the second is our high-end equipment, especially high-end power equipment is short board. The third is what our basic materials and basic components are short boards, especially high-end basic materials and basic components are short boards. Our country is the world's largest manufacturing country and the most comprehensive country. , But also the most difficult country to allocate resources in the world, because our opponents don’t want to see us stand up, get stronger, and surpass them, but our entrepreneurs, including our companies, see these shortcomings, I think not Terrible, but to find out which shortcomings are restricting the development of our enterprises, I think it is the eve of our shortcomings to carry out group breakthroughs. It needs our country and entrepreneurs represented by the entrepreneurs here to work together to gather strength and breakthroughs. This short board.\nAs far as I know, the current end products that are not well-made and will not be made in China are: digital SLR cameras (almost the world of small Japan), heavy helicopters, large ground effect aircraft, large hydrofoil ships, high-end superyachts, high-end bicycles, High-end motorcycles, high-end CNC machine tools. I hope that Chinese enterprises and scientific research institutes will exert their efforts in these areas! This is also a new business area for Chinese people. In fact, there are still many details of the core technology that China has not mastered, such as robotic 3D cameras, screen microspheres, etc.\nWithout a foundation, there are many things that cannot be made. The electronic equipment Intel CPU, linux and Microsoft windows operating system, Google Android system, there is no one we made ourselves, and the most common ink printer chips can not be made now. Last year's 2015 hot balance car MCU chips were all made in the United States. Large-sized aerospace engines can't be copied for a sample that is not the most advanced in front of you. The precision, durability and high temperature resistance require that production cannot be achieved. The super sports car in the automotive field cannot be built. At present, the horizontal shell of the domestic car is very strong, and the industrial level precision and durability are not good. Intelligent robots can't make Atlas robots of the United States are more advanced, and we can't copy them.",
      "11": "Gravity defying craft that travels many times the speed of sound that can zip effortlessly through air and water, intergalactic space craft, death starship & star fighter, dark matter, and some other materials which is still unknown to humans. BUT, they are getting there!",
      "12": "I’m going to be blunt & state something well known but often not acknowledged, admitted, or accepted.\nChina can’t or won’t manufacture things that their vast worldwide intelligence apparatus of operating officers, assets/agents can’t steal, copy, coerce, trade, bribe, blackmail, or frame others to obtain wanted/needed information to duplicate or build off of other’s innovations completed through earlier research and development. Most of their activities fall under industrial espionage that has many open society countries such as the U.S. & others extremely vulnerable to compromise & exploitation.\nGranted other countries including the U.S. probably do the same as above on a smaller scale but your question focuses on China.",
      "13": "China is even good at manufacturing for niche markets. I do fly fishing. Fly fishing must be the millionth thing on Americans’ to-do lists. I bought a couple of fly lines that I didn't know were from China ‘til I got them. They were rated highly. They perform admirably. Some fly fishers think their $40 Chinese reels perform admirably.\nI’ve bought resistors, capacitors, inductors, and integrated circuits directly from Chinese companies. It’s all quality components, as far as I can tell.\nChina can make anything. Do you know why? American, European, and Japanese capitalists moved their operations to China. They willingly gave China their technology in exchange for cheap labor. The CCP isn’t killing American jobs. It's your American capitalists and the political whores they hire.",
      "14": "Surprisingly, they cannot make pens whose ink flows continuously. They did try though, but produced them at a higher price that those made in Germany. I think they still import them from Germany.",
      "15": "They can manufacture a hell lot of things but quality is still an issue in many things.\nLike they manufacture cars but still not able to build a good quality one. They have not been able to penetrate international Market.\nThey produce chips but some of the technology is still imported.\nIndia sometimes order...",
      "16": "China can not manufacture lie, cheat and steal as her adversary does.\nChina is poor in toxic propaganda, demonizing and stigmatising campaign, and groundless accusation.\nChina yet to learn the art of regime changes, regime sanctions that can kill millions, devastate countries, cripple economies, impoverished people, creating homeless refugees.\nChina is yet to master the art of geopolitical terrorism, geopolitical vandalism, and geopolitical cannibalism like current hegemon did.\nChina is still a developing country, her advanced developed country adversary want her to change and embrace their value, believe and practices. But China view them as inhuman, human right violation, cancerous to mankind refuse to follow and embrace.\nThere will be tension between China and developed adversary because China refuse to follow the manufacturing trajectory of her adversary hegemon. Hopefully China will not learn those manufacturing skills."
