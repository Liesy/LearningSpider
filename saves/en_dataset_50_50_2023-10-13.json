    "answers": {
      "1": "Now while everybody's pictures are wonderful, I do not think they are specific to the Internet. They would not be out of place in an art gallery or a magazine, so I nominate this as the best picture on the Internet.\nNow for those of you who do not recognize what this image is from may not understand why I chose it. At the bottom you may recognize Van Gogh’s starry night.\nNow while this pixel art is pretty cool on its own, it’s not that impressive. However, what is impressive is how it was made. The image is from r/place which was Reddit’s April Fool’s Day event that lasted 72 hours. Every single pixel in the above images was placed individually by a Redditor. Every person on Reddit could place a pixel every ~10 min or so. Literally thousands of people were simultaneously placing pixels. Anybody could place a pixel anywhere, yet the Starry Night still got made. People came together, and collaborated to make something.\nYou can see the whole image take shape out of the chaos in this gif:\nUnderneath where the Mona Lisa forms you might see a dark spot form and disappear. That was an organized raid from 4chan in an attempt to ruin the image that failed. People were given the chance to make anything they wanted. There were no rules, no punishments, and people came together to make something instead of destroy. The final project, while not entirely coherent, could even be called art. The fact that people came together, and actually created something, is why it is my favorite image on the Internet. It is a symbol of what we can do together, and it shows what the Internet can and should be.\nEdit: Tyler Brown showed me this incredible heat map of r/place. For those of you that don’t know what a heat map is, it is a map of how frequently a specific spot was clicked. Brighter = more clicks, darker = less clicks.\nHere is his profile -> Tyler Brown\nEdit: For those asking\nLink to gif: Redirect Notice\nLink to original: place • r/place",

      "17": "The smile I saw on the face of this little girl made my day.\nShe is Nisha Kaur Weber. Sunny Leone and her husband adopted her last year from an orphanage.\nTalking to one of the newspapers, she said:\n“Right from the adoption papers and every minute things we have of her, will be shown to her. Nisha will have to know the fact that her mother did not abandon her. She bore her for nine months. I am not her real mom. But I am connected to her soul. I am her mom after adopting her.\"\n‘Deep respect’.\nI started liking her when I saw the controversial interview she had with Bhupendra Chaubey where she conducted herself with lots of grace and dignity.\nMy opinion is that it’s not appropriate to comment on someone’s personal choice of profession and how she leads her life but what’s important is how the person is in the real life.\nThe sparkling eyes and the smile visible on little kiddo’s face is a tight slap on the face of all the trollers who slut-shamed her for adopting the girl.\nFor me, this is the best picture on the Internet today.",

    "title": "Is it okay to use an iPhone 11 in 2023",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Why not? iPhone 11 is better, it has powerful A13 Bionic chip and it will continue to get iOS updates till 2024. If you are comfortable then no problem. If there is no problem doing everyday task then keep it. If you want some features then you can go for iPhone 14 or iPhone 15..",
      "2": "Yes,it is okay to use an iPhone 11 in 2023 in fact I am using iphone X without any hesitation and beleive me it work perfectly for me.\nInshort, you can easily use iphone 11 in 2023",
      "3": "If already have iPhone 11 and have no problems of using it , then it is okay to use in 2023 or 2024. But if you are planning to buy then it is not okay, because it has old A13 Bionic chip. You can either buy iPhone 12 or iPhone SE 2022.",
      "4": "Yes. Even I know so many people who are using iPhone 11 now and they are thinking to use till 2025. When it was launched, iPhone 11 was great. It has powerful A13 Bionic chip. What happen if it’s 2023 or 2025? You can and if your budget can support to buy it, this iPhone 11 is great to use. Or you can go for iPhone SE 2022 instead, this has most powerful A15 Bionic chip.",
      "5": "In 2023, the IPhone 11 will have no issues because Apple still sells it new on their website in Summer 2022. Heck, even the XR is still snappy in 2022. Given that, I would expect the IPhone 11 to still be “good enough” and supported well into 2025.\nAs for speed, the A13 is still faster than all but the top-end Android flagship processors from the past two years. And the bulk of Android phones sold are still far slower than the A13. In addition, if you are just the average user, and not into the highest-level games, the A13 chip still surfs as fast as nearly every Android smartphone to date, with the exception of the top tier. This is due to IPhone optimization, which Apple continues to improve on. Even the XR does very well in this category. Look up comparisons on surfing speeds using the Jetstream2 tests, as an example.\nLong term, I expect Apple to move to a subscription model, where you pay a monthly fee to use Apple IPhone, and the phone itself becomes nothing more than an exchange every year or two. The cost of changing the phone will be baked into your monthly payment.",
      "6": "It's absolutely fine no one's gonna judge you even if someone does who cares\nNow let's go to is it worth buying in 2k23\nIt's a pretty decent phone with a above average battery life ,a decent lcd panel . If you don't use 5g and are not planning to use as you stay in office or home most of the time where you have good wifi coverage i guess the 5g is just a gimmick for you . If you're a average user not a heavy one it should last a day long . It has a powerful a-13 bionic which is a beast still can do most of the tasks buttery smooth the design is a little old if you don't need flat edges it's good\nIt's gonna get ui updates for a few years 3–4 (max 5) it's not up to the date if you are getting it for a decent price like under 400$ or 35k rs\nIf purchasing a used one under 330$ or 24k rs is a fair amount for it just make sure the battery health is good and parts are original\nIt doesn't have a very bright display so you might experience a few problems in bright daylight but in most cases it will do just fine\nIf you're from a hotter region like india it might get a little too hot during Summers in your pocket",

      "9": "iPhone 11 does not have 5G or Millimetre Wave antennas for faster internet and its A13 bionic chip is pretty slow compared to A16 which is going to launch in 2023. If you are buying new phone, please do not buy iPhone 11 instead go for iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 Mini.",
      "10": "Yes, using an iPhone 11 in 2023 is still perfectly fine and capable for most tasks and functions.",
      "11": "There are some major things to consider iPhone 11 in 2023\n4G, 2023 is the era of 5G, 4G might bother you and make you feel outdated\nSoftware Update, Apple will provide you less updates than newer iPhones\nBattery Life, As apple launches new models, it degrades the battery of old models\nChipset, Less powerful when compared to newer models\nIf you are okay with the above statements then you can go for it, It will be suitable for the majority of your tasks, but It is still very much capable of managing heavy tasks. And as an apple even in 2023 and ahead, it won't lag as UI is just very much smooth.",
      "12": "Should You Buy iPhone 11\nin 2023?\nA slightly outdated phone that contains most of the unique features offered by Apple is still a great choice if you’re currently looking for budget options.\nFew Cons\nLower display quality\nlack of 5G connectivity\nShouldn’t cause major problems for the average user.\nPros\n6.1inch HD display\nBack Dual 12MP camera\nFront 12MP TrueDepth\nFace ID\nA13 Bionic chip\nWater resistant\nIf your requirements do not include those features, you can easily save quite a bit of money by getting yourself a phone that is now sold at a greatly reduced cost as compared to its launch price.\nMany users do like the idea of purchasing the latest iPhone version as soon as it is launched to stay ahead in the Apple ecosystem. However, it’s not particularly necessary!\nApple will continue to support the previous versions software-wise, so even if you are planning to buy a new iPhone 11, you can rest easy knowing that it will likely last you till roughly 2025.\nOverall, the iPhone 11\nstill matches up well to the current iPhone version in many aspects, and can save you a lot of money to boot!\nTip: We recommend you to consider only brand\nnewiPhone11\nunits.

      "14": "The iPhone 11 may look a little dated in the future of 2023. The technology that goes into smartphones has become so advanced that each new generation has improved far beyond what was put out just one year before it. This is due to cutting-edge research and rapid advancements in hardware in addition to enhanced software capabilities\nAll technology tends to stay relevant for several years and the lifespan of a new phone is usually 2–3 years",
      "15": "Yes, Even in 2023. iPhone 11 is still a great phone and is still relevant.\nIt has everything you need in a phone good camera. a very good battery life. Fast processor. I Bet it never Hang or get stuck.\nit is a good phone",
      "16": "if ur are super rich then its not ok… just for fun… its ur comfort…",
      "17": "Sure, using the iPhone 11 in 2023 could be a practical option for many people. However, for those who value cutting-edge camera technology or the latest features, a newer iPhone model may be worth considering.\nThe iPhone 11 is still a reliable device for various communication and productivity needs in 2023, but your specific requirements should guide your decision.",
      "18": "Yes, its completely fine, just the thing is till then iPhone 14 would be their and it would be a bit outdated to use iPhone 11 but it would still be a great phone.",
      "19": "If you already own an iPhone11 , yes it’s a perfect phone to use in 2023. But if you’re planning to buy it now, do not go for it. The processor is already 3 years old. If you need an Apple iPhone, go for at least the 12, though that is old but it’s a much better phone to buy in 2023\n.",
      "20": "Using an iPhone 11 in 2023 is perfectly fine, especially if the device meets your needs and is in good working condition. The iPhone 11, released in 2019, is a capable smartphone with many features that are still relevant and useful today. It has a good camera, a fast processor, and can run the latest iOS updates as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.\nHowever, whether it's the right choice for you in 2023 depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Here are some factors to consider:\nPerformance: If you use your phone for everyday tasks like calling, texting, browsing the web, and using common apps, the iPhone 11 should perform well. It may not be as fast as the latest models, but it should still be quite snappy.\nCamera: The iPhone 11 has a capable camera system that can produce good-quality photos and videos.

      "2": "The question is loaded with bias. Do you think anyone has a goal to simply prolong a war that has been so deadly for Ukraine? No. Nobody with reason thinks that way. Prolonging the war to expel the Russian invasion makes sense. Giving Ukraine the tools to fight for independence makes sense as well. The Ukrainians want to be free from the Russian empire. You know, the empire that is pretending to be a democracy. If you read history, the US earned their freedom from England thanks to the generosity of the French. The Ukraine fight is very similar except most of the world supports Ukraine.\nTo make this an either-or question is remarkable as well. Assuming these questions are not created by middle school students, you would have to say this is a strange comparison. You make it sound as if the government had not spent money on Ukraine, then homeless veterans would have had a windfall. Anyone over the age of thirteen knows that the homeless problem existed long before the war in Ukraine. Why wasn’t it solved when President Bush or President Obama was in office?\nIt didn’t make sense to me either.\nMark up another win for the Russian trolls.",

Nice touch.\nBut if you check the recent budget, not one dollar of aid to veterans was cut. Zero. Nil. Zilch. You see, it is not a zero sum game.

    "answers": {
      "1": "Because it is Russia who has been the aggressor, period.",
      "2": "Did USA attack Russian Federation?\nDid NATO?\nSo Yes you are a Putin's fan!\nThis makes me think of the rapist complaining that everything would have been fine if only his victim hadn’t fought back…with a freaking sword. In his mind, she clearly “escalated” the situation.\nOne can only hope that when she “escalated,” she cut his balls off.",
      "3": "Well obiviously because ”NATO agression against Russia” is pure fantasy that is only spreaded by Putin apologists and Russian bots/paid liars.\nIn reality NATO hasn’t done anything that would violate Russian soveirgnity, territorial integrity or legal rigths as a country.\nP.s. Providing material aid for Ukraine defending itself against illegal invasion does not constitute any kind of violation of Russian soveirgnity or its legal rigths and is therefore not considered an agression under international law.",
      "4": "Russia invaded Ukraine. That is aggression.\nHelping a victim such as Ukraine is not.",
      "5": "Well NATO hasn’t engaged in any aggression in regards to Russia or the Ukraine. so what are you talking about? Oh yes Russia doesn’t like the existence of NATO. They would prefer to pick off European nations one by one. NATO has never laid a foot in either Russia or the Ukraine. Russia on the other hand sure has a nasty record.",
      "6": "Tell me, what is this ‘NATO aggression’ you speak of?",
      "7": "The clue is in your question - there hasn’t been any NATO aggression towards Russia or Ukraine.",
      "8": "Because there IS NO NATO aggression in regards to Russia and Ukraine.\nErgo talking about such things is flatly lying, and spreading Kremlin propaganda, which labels every sneeze in the general direction of Moscow by every Assistant to the Assistant to the Aide to the Secretary of a NATO junior minister as “aggression”.",
      "9": "Because there is no NATO aggression.\nIt's a lie.\nIf you think it's real ell us what, where, and when NATO have shown aggression towards Russia.\nNATO is not involved in the conflict caused by Russia invading Ukraine.\nNATO is a defensive alliance.\nIndividual countries, some members of NATO, some not, are providing military supplies and training to Ukraine.\nBut if you parrot the lies of the Kremlin you're going to be labelled a Putin apologist or a Russian troll.",
      "10": "Simply put because NATO is not and never has been an aggressive organisation it is purely a defensive one. So please tell us all how NATO has been aggressive to Russia?\nThis level of mediocre fuckery is pre school child level and is indicative of either the terrible intelligence of Russian potaganists or their AI algorithms are dire.",
      "11": "Because NATO agression in regards to Russia is fiction created by Putin’s propaganda machine.\nUnless you consider countries joining NATO an act of agression, when it actually is but an act of self protection.",
      "12": "Well, there is a very simple answer: because you are in fact a Putinist or a Russian bot.\nNATO is helping an independent state defend itself— defend its very existence —against invasion by a powerful and brutal neighbor. If you’re against that, well…it becomes clear what you’re *for*.",
      "13": "Because only those people are blinded or paid enough to say those things. NATO’s involvement is solely in the minds of Putin and his people. We aren’t involved. Russia wishes we were so he has a moral grounding for doing what he has done, but we aren’t so he doesn’t.\nLouder for those at the back.\nNATO aren’t involved. Neither Ukraine or Russia are NATO member states.\nNATO doesn’t have troops fighting in combat in Ukraine.\nNATO are not the aggressors.\nNATO are not a fascist or nazi organisation.\nNATO are both trying to destroy Russia; Putin is doing that just fine without their help.\nSome NATO countries are providing weapons and support to Ukraine but many non-NATO countries are doing the same, eg Japan, Korea, Australia, Brazil and many others. Lots of countries are helping. That’s what happens when you bully someone smaller than you - nobody likes a bully.\nIf you honestly believe Russia is being threatened by NATO expansion then you haven’t been paying attention.\nHope this helps.",
      "14": "Maybe because there is NO NATO aggression in regards to Russia? How about that point? There is no one NATO soldier on russian territory and no one NATO missile killed none russian people. Therefore russian soldiers still are in Ukrainian territory and killed Ukrainians.",
      "15": "Give at least one instance of this so called NATO Aggression towards Russia. Just one.\nNATO reacts to the threat posed. Russia built up a massive force along the Ukrainian border, NATO reacted with raising the threat level. . . Russia then invaded Ukraine . . So NATO strengthened its Eastern Border. . . Where's the aggression?",
      "16": "Firstly, because the only people that say NATO is currently at war with Russia are, as you say, Putin apologists, or Russian bots. And secondly NATO hasn't invaded either Ukraine or Russia, and has no mechanism to do so. It's a defensive treaty. One of their members has to be attacked to trigger mandatory participation in a war. That hasn't happened.\nIf NATO did enter the conflict, it would, for good or ill, be over rather quickly.",
      "17": "If you disregard reality and spread lies about “NATO aggression in regards to Russia and Ukraine” then you are a Putin apologist or a Russian bot. Hope it answers your question.",
      "18": "Because NATO is mutual defence treaty. Ukraine is not a member but Putin has attacked and occupied all of his non-Nato neighbors. If Putin were to succeed in Ukraine then a Nato country would be next. Nato did not manipulate Putin into attacking all the small Islamic ‘stans’, nor Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and Ukraine. Nato did not make it a crime to criticize Putin nor make disloyalty treason. Putin is a danger to the world - as was Hitler.",
      "19": "Because there is no NATO aggression. NATO was never planning an invasion of Russia.\nPutin had to create a boogyman to stay in power as many dictators are known to do and many useful idiots fell for it.",
      "20": "Because if you aren’t one of those, and are talking about that, then you are an incredibly stupid and gullible person, since there hasn’t been ANY “NATO aggression” in that regard.",
      "21": "Because NATO has not committed any aggression towards Ukraine or Russia. Saying it has means you are either a) totally ignorant or b) spreading lies to help the Russian invasion by deceiving public opinion. The people responding to you seem to respect your intelligence enough that they assume the REASON you are posting such lies is that you are paid for it or somehow else under Putin’s influence. Also, every week thousands more Russian bots spreading such lies are uncovered, and more troll farms. Have you heard the one about walking like a duck, quacking like a duck? You quack like a bot or professional troll, people assume you are.",
      "22": "I’m pretty tired of Russia bombing hospitals and schools, torturing detainees, kidnapping children, destroying cities, destroying civilian infrastructure, and THEN complaining about Ukrainian and NATO aggression. Who started it? That’s like when the schoolyard bully pummels the skinny kid, but all of a sudden, the skinny kid strikes back and bloodies the bully’s nose. Now the bully is crying and running to the teacher “Johnny hit me!”.\nAnyone who defends Putin the bully IS a Putin apologist.",
      "23": "It’s easy. Because if you are talking about “NATO aggression in regards to Russia”, you are either a Putin apologist or a Russian bot ot Kremlin troll. No reasonable person who follows the events can support Putin’s agressive war.",
      "24": "How come when you talk about NATO aggression in regards to Russia and Ukraine you’re either labelled a Putin apologist or a Russian bot?\nYou would have to be one of those to ask that question or willfully ignorant of what is going on.\nNATO has not made a single overtly aggressive move … no troops on the ground, no air raids, no naval actions.\nMateriel and training? … hell yes. But that is analogous to FDR sending what ever he could to help at the outset of WWII in Europe.\n===============\nNow let ME ask 3 questions.\nHas the entire Russian air force become a steaming pile of scrap metal? No.\nHas the entire Russian navy been converted to a very large salvage-for-scrap operation, dive park, and artificial reef system? No.\nIs the remaining Russian army retreating in total disarray and/or deserting in large numbers? No.\nThen NATO has not made “aggressive moves”.\nI will bet “50$ and a box of doughnuts” the ONLY reason none of that has happened is Czar Putler has access to launch codes for nuclear weapons. (The doughnuts will suffice as payment)\nThe Russian people need to clean up their internal “leadership” mess … sooner rather than later.",
      "25": "Why nobody who like to talk about “ NATO aggression “ in regards to Russia never talk about US military base that existed in Russia till 2014",
      "26": "How dare the nasty Ukranians fight back. Thats cheating. If NATO were involved Putin would be long gone.",
      "27": "Because it was Russia that invaded Ukraine not NATO that invaded Russia (or Ukraine). Clear enough, pomieniatchik?",
      "28": "‘How come when you talk about NATO aggression in regards to Russia and Ukraine you’re either labelled a Putin apologist or a Russian bot?’ - Because most of the submissions in support of Russia do originate with Putin apologists or Russian bots. It’s that simple.",
      "29": "Well, firstly, NATO has shown NO aggression against Russia. Indeed, NATO is not directly involved. The many, many countries helping Ukraine to defend itself include a lot that are not in NATO.\nAnd just how has ANYBODY shown aggression against Russia? Yes, many have given equipment to use against Russian forces IN UKRAINE, but that is not Russia.",
      "30": "Because people are too polite to call you thr [redacted]] sack of [redacted] who sucks roadkill off of country lane.\nNo one has aggressor against Russia.",
      "31": "Well NATO isn’t involved in Ukraine and hasn’t attacked russia.\nSo gee. You are lying about aggression so no wonder you get slammed for it.\nHere’s a hint: Lie less, you get more discussion.\nOnce again: STOP LYING. Lies are bad. Truth is good.",
      "32": "Because there is no NATO aggression.",
      "33": "Because it is true, you are either a bot or in the pay of fsb",
      "34": "Your question smells russian propaganda thats how.\nThere is no agression from NATO towards russia and especially Ukraine.\nNATO has not attacked neither russia nor Ukraine.\nActually some NATO countries, not NATO itself, and a lot more countries decided on their own to help Ukraine from the russian agression.\nThats the only agression happening.\nrussia, the agressor, attacking Ukraine.",
      "35": "Because NATO there was no NATO aggression against Russia. ALL aggression was Russia against Ukraine, though all the democratic nations have assisted Ukraine to resist this unwarranted aggression from Russia. Well, the second time. Russia took over Crimea (a Ukrainian territory) and part of the Ukraine “because” the first time, in 2014.",
      "36": "Let's see what Vladolf Putler does.",
      "37": "Because the same goes for the Cuba missile crisis in 1962.\nEverybody who thought that an independent country that invites a main adversary for an alliance and to install military equipment in near vicinity would be a threat to the other adversary were true American bots, or JFK stooges.\nHow difficult can it be…",
      "38": "Because European self-defense is considered aggression by Orcs. So if you see NATO actions as aggressive, you are an Orc toady.",
      "39": "The most logical answer is that NATO has the most powerful propaganda.\nDeflection of all criticism is a classic foundation of a well functioning propaganda system.\nRelated reading here>\nDaniel Anthony\n· 9mo\nIs people insulting pro Russian commentators on Quora a subconscious need to reflect the dismay that NATO and Ukraine are losing?\nThe US/Uk corporate state propaganda system conditions people to consider any challenge to their narrative as ‘Pro-Russian’. It makes no difference whether that challenge comes from a russian or not, or if there is any connection of the challenge or other narrative/opinion given to any Russian source. It doesn’t matter. Nor does it have any different effect if the criticism of Western narrative is completely absent of any accompanying support for the Russian state. Still the same response because this programming collects > Any criticism of the Western permissible narrative Any criticism of the Ukranian state narrative and conditons people to conclude this is actually PRO RUSSIAN STATE, PRO MASS MURDER, PRO RAPE, PRO EVIL DICTATORS, PRO NAZI. Clearly this equivalence is simply not accurate, but tell enough people, enough times, and they then start telling each other the same…the validity or truth of the statement is of no interest. The aim is to have people fully blinkered, to consider ALL criticism of the one narrative permissible as russian propaganda, to be dismissed out of hand. Could be something as simple as questioning the accuracy of unsubstantiated KIA figures, which are impossible to verify. That is enough to have the conditioned immediately condemn as russian propaganda/putin troll/ krembot etc. Could be suggesting that it seems unlikely a Ukraniani pensioner shot a military jet out the sky with a catapult. Same response though - KREMBOT!!! Most of these people do no research. They don’t check the main talking points provided by a corporate state media system in lock step and long working with the social media platforms and search engines to further narrow freedom of speech. They likely do zero research into any independent analysts, let alone Russian, to gain any kind of objective perspective beyond that one prescribed narrative they are conditioned to believe is 100% true, so true in fact that there is no need to ever consider it could be wrong, for to do so makes you…a russian troll! A supporter of murder and rape! Putin’s puppet! etc. etc. The power of the Western corporate state propaganda machine is incredible. Its resources immense. Its expansive nature long established between corporate and state intelligence. Nothing anywhere else on earth comes near it. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Youtube alongside all corporate mainstream media are connected to the intelligence agencies, to the FBI, to the same corporate entities who spread across the factcheckers (for those who need to be told by a corporation what is true and what is false). Yes, the war appears to not be progressing as is reported by the US/UK led collective West. Just look at the first article shared in the piece I wrote yesterday. It is not Kremlin propaganda, but from one of the major extremely PRO- Kiev platforms. And it paints a harrowing picture of how Bakhmut is going for the AFU. Many people are conditioned to insult anyone who challenges their one programmed narrative. It is not a subconscious reflection of dismay, its basic lemming herding conditioning alongside the complete absence of any capacity for critical thinking. And the reality is that all this talk of Russian propaganda hides the fact that the Russian state have a pipsqueak in comparison of resources and apparatus to promote any serious information warfare outside of Russia. The vast majority of Westerners commenting on ‘russian propaganda’ have researched zero russian sources. They are simply told what is ‘russian propaganda’ by the West and their prize puppet Zelensky, who another user quite smartly suggested as the Greta Thunberg of war… It is sad and depressing to find so many people so easily led, yet I must give solid acceptance of the incredible power of the Western propaganda machine. Limitless resources, many decades working together between corporate and state and firmly in control of public opinion in the West. Not beyond…and when I point this out to people, some of the responses are horrific. Some chap recently told me that ‘quite right, daniel, but I am talking of the civilised world…’. More conditioning.",
      "40": "I am a logic based objective thinker. Pres Biden has not given one legitimate reason that Ukraine has any significance to NATO countries security. The U.S. government seems to not value human life very highly. I do not care about Russia or Putin. I know I am being lied to and being played by President Biden. In a legitimate debate noone could win trying to justify this war. The U.S. goes crazy over 2,977 Americans dying on 911. There could be 500,000 human beings killed in this war. That is not fake deaths that is real humans being blown up, shot and dead. Americans are crazy not to recognize this. Immature underdeveloped brains support this war.",
      "41": "Many Americans believe world history started in February of 2022. If your history started there, you cannot possibly understand this conflict and will call others Putin apologists and all manner of ignorant shit."

      "3": "It is brand ambassador of the world 🌍",
      "4": "“Do humans deserve to live?”\nNo.\nNot in any absolute sense, anyway.\nLife is grace. It is an unearned and unearn-able gift. We are given the span of years God allots, and we have no right to any more than that, nor any reason to feel that those years allotted are anything more or less than divine magnanimity.\nThat being said, each person is entitled to their life, even if they don’t deserve it.\nIf a mother gives her son a lollipop just to see him smile, he doesn’t deserve his candy. But it is nonetheless his candy, vis a vis every other person in the world except his mother—that is, he may not deserve it, but his right to have it is nonetheless superior to the right of any other person.\nAs long as he doesn’t abuse it.\nIf he takes his sticky lollipop and starts pressing it against a stranger’s clean suit, that stranger has every right to take the lollipop away, even though he (the stranger) has no prior claim to the lollipop and the child does.\nLikewise, while I don’t deserve the life I have, no one has any right to take it from me, unless by living I am infringing on their valid rights.\nAs to the silliness in the question details—blather about how humans are “a pain to this planet and every living being in it”—that doesn’t merit any serious response.\nThe Earth belongs to us (as tenants and stewards, at least) not us to it.\nWe ought to be good stewards. But the notional reification of the biosphere has no rights against us.\nIt is God Who judges our stewardship, and if He decides we’re unworthy to live, there will be no need for a Quora answer to make that clear.",

      "6": "A human is like a virus. Wherever it lands it starts to reproduce and expand its ever growing lineage. It consumes and exploits every natural resource till its last drop. Once it has fed itself it relocates to another land and initates the cycle again. Unlike other species humans cannot maintain an equilibrium with their surroundings. Humans have to alter their surroundings for their comfort even if it means harm to another specie or fellow human. Coming back to the point, When a virus uses a human as its host a human doesn't let it survive for the damage it causes to the body. So should mother Earth do the same? pop in an antibiotic ? well that decision lies only with her. You'll get your answer the day you feel that the end is near.",
      "7": "No not at all. Only babies and animals deserve everything in this world rest all here are only to make trouble.",
      "8": "You were brought into existence by someone else. It’s not a question of deserving or not deserving to live. Rather, it’s just a fact: you are here. You exist. Your life is just as real and just as relevant as anyone else’s life.",
      "9": "Whether we deserve or not, we HAVE to live here only !\nWhere else can we go ? No planet of either the solar system or of the Milkyway galaxy can support us.\nWe, the humans, were created by NATURE, under the probability of 1 in 1 trillion of a septillion.ie., 1 in 1 followed by 21 zeros.\nWho else than such a rare, unique species deserve to live in our Earth?",
      "10": "Nothing is permanent. In every religion there is a concept of PRALAYA, destruction of everything and restart from the ZERO.\nNothing deserves to remain permanently.\nHumans are no exception.",
      "11": "Now this is a question that would have some complicated answers.\nI don’t think there’s a question that Humans have earned the right to thrive on our planet. Of the uncountable different species that have existed, we have been the ones that have managed to evolve in a way that allows us to live such a different life to every other animal currently alive.\nGo team! Let’s buy new cars!\nHowever, as a by-product of this development, the Human race has become so detached from Nature and the planet in general, most of us can’t even see the true extent of the havoc we are wreaking on Earth.\nThe supply/demand system which we live by is relentless, the face of the planet is changing so dramatically, and with there now being over 7 BILLION of us (rapidly expanding) this is only going to get more and more significant.\nThink about that. 7 BILLION. Even the furthest reaches of the planet, Antarctica aside, have signs of human development. The ‘wilderness’ areas of the world, which is apparently what we are now calling normal, not-yet-ruined land, are dwindling and it seems people it’s cannot leave them alone. For example, some people can not comprehend why drilling for oil in Alaska’s largest wildlife refuge is a BAD thing. Hey, if we can make money, screw it.\nMaybe one day the general population will realise that this planet was around a very long time before we arrived, and it will be a long time after we are gone as well. Some things are really more important than is and our lives.\nSome people are great but, as a whole, Earth would really be better if we just dissappeared, preferably taking our hundreds of billions of tonnes of concrete with us.\nHave a happy day!",

      "13": "Human race is the best example of stupidity. We have limited natural resources, our actions should be based on that fact but they are not. People want money and when they get them they become blind .. to anything, to any other facts. Isn’t this enough to prove we absolutely don’t deserve to live?",
      "14": "I think this question is very opinionated.\nFirst of let's get this clear, this question will have very different answers based on varying belief structures.\nI myself believe that looking at current condition and history of the impact us humans have made on the earth, simply put the answer is no.\nFor some barbaric reason humans seem to think that we are far superior to any life form that exist. Maybe it's the fact we experience consciousness with a complex social and belief systems. My point is that all life is equal, and should be treated with the same respect we would want.\nWe need to drastically reduce our “footprint” before we could consider to be deserving of this beautiful place we call Earth. I think Earth is already too far gone as a result from our destructive nature. The sheer devastation we have already unleashed upon this place is terrifying. The deadly war machine’s we have created are deeply disturbing. The industrialized inventions are an example of how far we will go to rape the Earth of its resources.",
      "15": "No, we didn't do anything to earn this planet. We didn't work to get the dust to gather at the formation of the solar system. Earth’s biosphere can get along just fine without humanity. However, we don't deserve to not have Earth either. As the dominant species on this planet (aka the only species that has realized that Earth is a planet), we live in a sort of symbiotic relationship with the planet. The planet gives us resources and we attempt to keep the biospheres stable by maintaining populations of certain animals. It would be a good idea to attempt to leave the planet though, because as a byproduct of our living here, we will inevitably run out of fuels and metals. Eventually our population will be so large that we will have to colonize other worlds in order to survive. in this case, it's better to think of humanity as not something that deserves any planet, but something that needs Earth and other planets to survive. We're kind of like bacterial colonies. We depend on a certain set of conditions to live, and when we get too large for our container to provide those conditions, we are forced to move to another container."

    "answers": {
      "1": "Leaders who are unafraid to go to war, are the worst leaders. A nation’s leader must feel the loss of every soldier like the loss of their own child. Throwing some one else’s child into bubbling, burning crucible of death that is war, with no heart for how the family suffers, is complete failure on the part of the nation’s leader.\nI cannot answer if Biden “fears” going to war with Russia or China. I don’t live in his head, nor in his heart. He will not be on the firing line with the soldiers. There’s no reason for him to fear, just like any other national leader. I do hope that he fears for the families who must accept the deaths of sons and daughters.\nWar isn’t a computer game, where you send computer-generated avatars to their doom at your whim. In war, real people die, real people never come home again, or they come home battered and incomplete, missing limbs, missing parts of their soul, never again the same person.\nLet us hope that all national leaders are afraid to some degree, not like Vladimir Putin, careless of the lives of his own people. You may call Putin strong because he sacrifices other people’s children without a care in the world. I call that, a complete failure.",
      "2": "In a post a couple months ago, I recounted how I almost got into a fight with a guy who got very aggressive with my wife, shouting at her to get out of the elevator so he could get in.\nWe were already getting out. My 4 year old daughter was with us, and my wife was so stunned she didn’t immediately respond in her usual aggressive manner.\nHad my daughter not been there, I would have pinned him under his bike and forced him to apologise. I had already sized up his weak position.\nI didn’t do this because my priority was protecting my family. It would be a different matter if he had attacked one of us, then I would have retaliated with extreme prejudice. He was verbally rude and aggressive, which is a totally different thing.\nHad I “gone to war” with him, I would have placed my family in great danger. Instead, I did what I always advocate in my self-defense content: get away from the situation instead of escalating.\nI fumed the whole day. It made me feel incompetent and weak, but that was my ego and pride talking. I knew I made the right decision, regardless of how I felt about it.\nSomeone else without constraint or self-control may have gotten into a fight. People have gotten into fights and died for far less.\nYou see, I have a responsibility for the safety and well-being of my family. If I do things that threaten their safety and well-being, I don’t get to pretend like it was someone else’s fault. It’s my responsibility, my fault.\nAlso, I want to teach my daughter not to use violence to solve problems. I want her to use her ingenuity and smarts.\nOur leaders have the same responsibility.\nAre you sure you would respect a leader who goes to war over every provocation and perceived slight?\nMost people would not want this kind of leader. Most people want peace, prosperity, safety, stability.\nOnly the most irresponsible and weak-willed choose conflict when another path can be chosen. They make these decisions for their own benefit, to serve their ego and pride, at your cost.\nThese leaders who choose violence when they can choose otherwise have failed in their duties.\nWeak and irresponsible leaders also create atmosphere for violence just so they can have it and pretend that “it wasn’t me!” when the other party is left with no choice.\nForcing China of Russia into violence is the same thing. You can pretend it wasn’t your fault, but it would be; but that requires honesty. Irresponsible people usually have other character flaws, such as dishonesty.",
      "3": "President Biden won’t personally be enlisting, so no reason for him to be afraid. His son Beau served, so he probably understands the seriousness of sending young men to die.\nRussia has threatened to use battlefield nuclear weapons numerous times. One thing to be said about Putin, don’t call his bluff. As for China, Biden has already broken protocol twice by clearly stating that he will defend Taiwan in the event of an attack.\nSo in my opinion, he seems responsible, measured in his responses, and resolute. Just thank your lucky stars that the Orange Man doesn’t have the nuclear briefcase right now.",
      "4": "Anyone with a modicum of common sense doesn’t want to go to war with a nuclear-armed power. That doesn’t make them a “weak leader”. Given that nuclear war would have a good chance of ending civilization on Earth, anybody who *wants* to go to war with Russia or China is insane.\nIf a war against Russia or China was necessary, perhaps to defend their neighbors as part of treaties, I have no doubt that President Biden would enter into such a war. But nobody should be *eager* to have such a war, and the fact that Biden is cautious about getting into an unnecessary war doesn’t make him weak, it makes him sensible.",
      "5": "Afraid? Are you nuts? Only a total idiot, would send people to die, what on earth is wrong with you people, is killing the only thing that gets your rocks off?",
      "6": "Because Russia and China are nuclear powers and only a desperate, demented, trapped failure of a leader would deliberately start a war with a nuclear power.",
      "7": "Original Question: Is President Biden afraid to go into war with Russia or China? Does that make President Biden a weak leader?\nOne of President Biden’s sons, Beau Biden, served in Iraq. We want a President who is reluctant to go to war. We want a President who is willing to take leadership in building a coalition standing up against Russia’s designs on Ukraine, and to take a strong stand against dictatorships.",
      "8": "Biden is a puppet and will do as told by the hidden power.",
      "9": "Are you insane? Perhaps you haven't heard that Russia and China are nuclear powers. A war with either of them could easily spin out into a nuclear one. Only a lunatic would not be dissuaded by that. Thank God you're not in charge.",
      "10": "No, but it makes this questioner a naive when it comes to international diplomacy.",
      "11": "Do you recognise this man? This is Neville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1937–40.\nIn the picture he is holding a copy of the Anglo-German declaration, whilst he gave the “peace for our time” declaration. Chamberlain claimed that war with Germany had been averted through appeasement on the Czechoslovakian problem. The idea was simple, the Nazis would annex German speaking regions of Czechoslovakia, Hitler would then leave the rest of Europe alone.\nPost-WW2 analysis tells us that Nazi Germany would not have been able to launch the invasion of Poland and thus WW2, had the global community stopped Germany earlier, this issue would have been averted. He has not been treated well by history. We are told that he was weak by seeking to appease Hitler. Viewing these events with historic empathy, this is not the case. Chamberlain was not intimidated by Hitler, but like most politicians of the day, the horrors of WW1 were still vividly clear in his mind. In 1938, everyone over the age of roughly 25 had personal memories of the war. I cannot sum up on one Quora post the scale, affect and devastation WW1 had on people. I’d argue that the effects of WW1 were far more severe on the individual than WW2. Chamberlain, like every other politician of his day, wanted to do everything before risking a return to anything like the scenes from the 1910s.\nHow does this relate to Joe Biden and NATO? The stakes are far higher now than in the 1930s. The prospect of mutually assured destruction is something no responsible leader could play with. Biden wants to hit Russia as hard as possible without entering direct conflict. Direct conflict immediately places the prospect of nuclear warfare on the table. Russian military doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons if the state’s existence is threatened. If there are American troops attempting to take back Ukrainian controlled land, that would almost certainly include Crimea. Russia regards Crimea as an integral part of its territory as it does Moscow or Siberia. By Russian military philosophy, that is a green light to use nuclear weapons. This is why these referendums being held in the occupied territories of Ukraine are seen as a huge escalation.\nPresident Biden does not fear war with Russia or China. What Biden fears is the unimaginable consequences of said war. Like Chamberlain 80+ years ago he is acting to avert a horrific crisis, unlike Chamberlain he is causing damage to the Russian state through sanctions and unprecedented lethal aid packages to Ukraine.",

      "13": "War is not a pissing contest. Men and women die in war. The only way to win is to make the other side die.\nWar is an option, but it’s very close to the bottom of a long list.",
      "14": "I believe there are plenty of reasons to prove that president Biden will not be scared to go into war with Russia or China. Let me try to point some out:\nWhy would anyone be afraid to send some other people into a war knowing clearly that he’d never be going himself personally into the war: and particularly not to the frontline?\nKnowing undoubtedly that his armed forces are far more competent than any other military force in the world, why would he be afraid of Russia or China? On top of it president Biden has nothing to lose, he’s counting his seventy’s and is a very successful American who is now the president.\nIt’s important to note that even if the president is not personally afraid of, he’d be scared to send his troops to such a war knowing that some of his men are also going to die. He wouldn’t want that to happen even if he’s not scared to go into war.\nThose leaders who has no fear at all to go into a war are only dictators like Saddam Hussein, V Putin, B Asad, etc. Because they’re all idiots: they know they don’t go frontline to fight but it’s just their poor citizens to get politically slaughtered.",
      "15": "No. He heads a democracy. I don’t think the American people would vote for him again if he declared war on Russia or China. In any case it’s not his decision alone.",
      "16": "Though I do not agree with Biden or any American president all too much, there are lots of good reasons for any country to not go to war with Russia and China.\nNuclear Weapons\n(Image Source: Statista)\nAs you can see in this graph, Russia has lots more nukes than the States and if it were to ally itself with China in a war, then it would be catastrophic for the whole world. And it is obviously not wise to undermine the capability of nuclear weaponry since it only takes a few bombs to end civilization as we know it.\nAn image of the detonation of the Tsar bomb.\n(Image Source: Live Science)\nEconomy\nWhether you like it or not, the States’ and China’s economies are heavily intertwined. Many American companies have factories in China whilst China also buys a lot of US services. If the event of war ever takes place, then oh well, the economies between these two countries will be heavily affected.\nAn image inside General Motor, an American car company, Norsom Motors plant in China.\n(Image Source: Car Scoop)\nGlobal Perception of the States\nIn the event of a war between these very powerful nations, it is evident that many other countries will be involved. This obviously means that there shall be more death and more people’s lives shall be affected. Though some countries may maintain a positive or at least neutral perspective on the States, there still exists the possibility of nations having a more negative light of the US especially if it has a warmongering president.\nSo thus, returning to the question, though Biden has obviously made mistakes as president of the States, it is not to say that he is a weak leader for not declaring war on economic and military superpowers.",
      "17": "I don’t know whether he is afraid, but not going to war is the prudent course of action at the moment. The USA has jumped into enough conflicts, it would be better not to add another one to the list unless it is really necessary. Which it is not, at the moment.",
      "18": "No that makes him wise. Wars are costly in money and more importantly lives. Any leader who isn’t afraid to go to war especially with nuclear powers is a damn fool and has no place being leader. War should always be a last result.",

      "3": "First of all, almost any laptop can be used for programming. Despite the popular thought among non-programmers — actual coding doesn't take much system resources as it's only text editing. There are some tasks that may require some processor power — compilation; or RAM — android or iOS device emulation; much more rare GPU — machine learning, game development. But as for me, I was able to try each of this on my 10 years old laptop with 6gb RAM and i3.\nRegarding the best options now. For most types of development the most popular option is Mac. Because of its UNIX-based OS, that allows to take advantage of bash and bash scripts; its reliability and stability, long battery life, speed (especially M-series processors) and so on. Many people find MacBooks to be great investment, and just pleasant to use, compact and beautiful laptops. It can be used for backend and fronted development, desktop or mobile sw, cloud solutions, DB development, maybe some games.\nBut there are also scenarios when Macs cannot be used. For example, embedded (very often), machine learning (as it uses GPU and MacBooks ones are not as powerful as windows laptops), platform specific development etc. Models that came up in my mind are ThinkPads, dell XPS, Asus vivobooks.\nAll in all, there aren't any stuff specific for programming, you just need to choose what you like and what is suitable for you in terms of price, battery life, form factor and so on. And also what exact you want to program.\nMy personal choice is lightweight Asus vivobook 14 inch, with i5. As I do many embedded programming when the sw is only available for Windows. Also I'd like to try MacBook with M processor because of its amazing speed and battery life, unfortunately that's not an option for me for now.",

On paper, Putin would appear to be an average Russian, but it is alleged he is one of the wealthiest people on earth.",
      "5": "From my understanding the oligarchs are not in favour of the war. They stand to lose in a war. I think this is all Putin’s decision. Even his army generals are not in favour.",
      "6": "I am sure that some oligarchs do benefit. All of the oligarchs have as much say as anyone who is a Putin business partner.",
      "7": "Very little. It’s his old cronies in the Russian FSB, née Russian KGB\n, that he has to watch out for!\nSee\nPutin doesn’t fear a coup by oligarchs. But he should fear his ex fellow spies.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/10/putin-coup-russia-siloviki/\nand\nRussian spy chief arrested, officials split over Ukraine invasion\nForeign reports have indicated that Russian authorities are bickering over their invasion of Ukraine.\nhttps://www.jpost.com/international/article-701772\nDouble click on Blue (Bolded) text for link(s)!",
      "8": "It does not matter if they had any influence over Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. As Russian oligarchs, they supported Putin by contributing a significant part of the monies they made to him. This was done in exchange for Putin allowing them to operate their businesses without any interference. It is these monies that in part allowed Putin to pay for the resources he needed to invade Ukraine. The oligarchs probably did not benefit from this invasion or know anything about it before it happened, but they were indirectly partially responsible for financing it and should be held accountable. They knew they were an integral part of the corrupt system of operations of the Russian government and agreed to participate in it. It will now be the courts and western politics that determines how much they will have to pay for their roles in Putin’s government.",
      "9": "Six oligarchs have been found dead this year, in three cases their entire families were killed too, including young children. They were all made to look like suicides or murder-suicides, but it is Putin sending a very clear message to the oligarchs - any disloyalty will be met with death, possibly even including their wives and children.\nThe oligarchs are not going to try to influence Putin when he is in such a murder mood.",
      "10": "None.\nBusiness men and women want peace because it is easier to conduct business and the only people who are benefiting from this war are\n(a) conspiracy theorists\n(b) Putin’s psychiatrist, who must realise that the Terrible Tot has gone off his rocker, but who charges enormous fees not to say so.",
      "11": "Absolutely none whatsoever! It is extremely bad for business. and for oligarchs, business comes first, second and last.",
      "12": "I would guess “none”. In fact they would have every reason to be opposed, as they would suffer in the event of predictable sanctions. Putin, in my opinion, made the decision to invade over their objections. In fact it may well be that he WANTED to curb their influence and he has been able to use the West to do just that.",
      "13": "Money is a big driver for Putin. His oligarchs are a part of Putin’s decision making. Some are now jumping ship because Putin is running this war on his own and not doing it well.",
      "14": "Unlike wealthy people in the United States, Russian oligarchs didn’t inherit their money. They all dropped to their knees before Vladimir Putin. They have money because Putin channeled money to them.\nAs long as they blindly support Putin, Putin allows them to live.\nThose Russian oligarchs, like Putin, really love vacationing in Odessa, Ukraine. They are willing to suffer a little in order to exterminate the Ukrainian people so they can have Odessa all to themselves.",
      "15": "I think may of the oligarchs are going to be angry with Putin, because of the sanctions that will be imposed on them. They support him because he has enabled them to live in fabulous luxury, while most Russians are impoverished. If Putin’s war causes their foreign assets to be frozen, they might feel betrayed.",
      "16": "They had no influence whatsoever, he doesn’t care if they get thrown under the bus.\nThey have been losing billions for months.\nAfter he takes the Ukraine, he will divide it up among loyalists. He may choose them or new ones depending on their support while he replaces the dethroned puppet dictator back in charge.",
      "17": "Not much influence in my opinion. This is Putin’s private project. No big benefit to oligarchs except for oil and gas guys since prices are up, but stocks down.",
      "18": "What invasion. The Ukrainian government has had no control over those regions for over 8 years. No invasion.\nI doubt very much the oligarchs have an issues with Putin going to the defense of those Russians. They understand that for Putin to maintain the satisfaction of the people o Russia he must protect ethnic Russians. Just like Americans get very upset with a president that does not protect other Americans, most people of the world want t people of their ethnic group protected against the evils of other countries. And Ukraine has proven to not be concerned about the welfare of its ethnic Russians. Politically, to maintain the support of the Russian people, Putin and the oligarchs had to come to the defence of ethnic Russians.",
      "19": "Putin made deals with oligarchs on condition they support him and his decisions. Between 2000 and 2004, this bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain their powers, in exchange for their explicit support of – and alignment with – Putin's government. So I can’t imagine any of them would criticise Putin’s decision to invade if they know their financial situation will remain unchanged."

    "answers": {
      "1": "There are many great countries to visit as a family, but here are a few of the most popular and highly-rated destinations:\nCosta Rica: Costa Rica is a nature lover's paradise, with lush rainforests, stunning beaches, and active volcanoes. Families can enjoy a variety of activities, such as hiking, zip-lining, surfing, and visiting wildlife sanctuaries.\nCanada: Canada is a vast and diverse country, with something to offer everyone in the family. From the bustling cities of Toronto and Vancouver to the majestic Rocky Mountains, there's no shortage of things to see and do. Families can enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, skiing, and snowboarding, as well as visiting museums, art galleries, and historical sites.\nAustralia: Australia is a land of adventure and excitement, with stunning natural landscapes, unique wildlife, and vibrant cities. Families can enjoy everything from surfing and swimming at Bondi Beach to visiting the iconic Sydney Opera House and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.\nItaly: Italy is a country with a rich history and culture, making it a perfect destination for families with children of all ages. From the ancient ruins of Rome to the canals of Venice to the rolling hills of Tuscany, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Families can visit museums, historical sites, and art galleries, as well as sample delicious Italian cuisine.\nJapan: Japan is a country of contrasts, with modern cities and ancient temples side by side. Families can enjoy visiting historical sites such as the Imperial Palace and Kiyomizu-dera Temple, as well as experiencing Japanese culture through food, festivals, and traditional arts.\nUltimately, the best country to visit for a family trip depends on your family's interests and budget. But any of the countries listed above would be a great choice for a memorable and enjoyable vacation.\nConsider your family's interests. What do your kids like to do? Do they enjoy outdoor activities, history, culture, or something else entirely? Choose a destination that offers something for everyone in the family.\nThink about your budget. Travel can be expensive, so it's important to set a budget before you start planning your trip. Some countries are more affordable than others, so be sure to factor in the cost of flights, accommodation, food, and activities when making your decision.\nDo your research. Once you've narrowed down your choices, take some time to research each destination in detail. Read travel reviews, blog posts, and guidebooks to get a better sense of what each country has to offer.\nTalk to your family. Once you have a few destinations in mind, talk to your family to get their input. What are they most excited about seeing and doing? By getting everyone involved in the planning process, you can ensure that everyone has a great time on your family vacation.",
      "2": "There are FAR too many variables for us to make a sensible recommendation without knowing more:\nHow big is your family? How old are the children? etc.\nHow much time do you have to spend on the visit? Three days? A week? A month?\nHow much money do you have to spend on the visit? Are you basically backpackers, or more the kind who wants to spend the night in air-conditioned hotels?\nWhere do you live and what’s your travel budget?\nAnd that’s not even getting into what kind of things you (all) like: tropical scenery, imposing mountains, exotic foods, historical buildings and landmarks, concerts and shows, museums, wandering the streets, lying in the sun, bargaining in the markets vs. shopping in luxury stores, new sports & games, etc.\nAlso: How much do you worry about physical danger, about cleanliness and hygiene, about floundering around and getting lost in an environment where you can’t speak the language or read the signs . . .?\nI’m sure if you narrowed this down a bit you’d get more helpful advice. I’ve traveled extensively in my long life, and regretted almost nothing (even the bad experiences were, well, experiences) but if my health permitted me to travel again, there are some places I’d go back to eagerly and some that would be much lower priority. (As well as places I never got to, like Angkor and Machu Picdhu.)",

      "4": "A lot depends on what you like doing, where you are located and some details about the ages and size of your family. I think that you are in South Korea, but I am not sure,\nRelatively nearby to you is Indonesia and Thailand. I am not including Japan or China as you likely know more about them than I do. These countries are quite divers and have activities for all ages.\nIn Europe, I would suggest Italy or England. These countries have good tourist infrastructure and again, activities for all age groups. They are also quite diverse from one area to another.\nIn South America, I would suggest Peru or Ecuador. These countries are smaller and can be covered well in a visit. Peru would be the more diverse with places such as Lake Titicaca, Machu Picchu (and Cuzco), Lima, Arequipa and Nazca. Ecuador has Quito and Cuenca.\nIn North America, Central American countries are smaller and easier to cover in a visit. Costa Rica is a good choice. The larger countries of the U.S., Mexico and Canada would need for you to select an area and focus on that for a trip.\nFor Africa, although it is far away, you might look at South Africa with its animal safaris and maybe a side trip to Victoria Falls.\nEnjoy.",
      "5": "Whichever country your Mom’s family emigrated from. If you or she doesn’t know, pick either Ireland or Italy. Many (most?) Americans come from one of the two. Plus, they’re both great countries to visit, there’s lots to see and do, the people are friendly, and the food is great in Ireland and out-of-this-world in Italy.",
      "6": "When choosing a country for a family trip, it really depends on your family's interests and preferences. However, if you're looking for a unique and memorable vacation experience, consider the United States and specifically Redbud Falls Ranch in North Texas.\nReasons to Choose Redbud Falls Ranch:\nRanch Experience: Redbud Falls Ranch offers a genuine ranch experience, allowing your family to immerse themselves in the beauty of the Texas countryside.\nNature Escapes: If your family enjoys the outdoors, you'll find plenty of opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, and wildlife encounters.\nRelaxation: It's an ideal place for relaxation, where you can unwind in a peaceful and tranquil setting.\nFamily Bonding: The ranch provides a unique backdrop for family bonding, whether it's around a campfire, exploring nature trails, or sharing stories under the starry Texas sky.\nVariety of Activities: Redbud Falls Ranch offers a range of activities for all ages, from horseback riding to fishing and more.\nClose to Dallas-Fort Worth: The ranch's location in North Texas makes it easily accessible from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, so you won't have to travel far.\nAuthentic Texan Experience: Experience a taste of Texas culture, including delicious local cuisine and warm hospitality.\nSo, if you're looking for an unforgettable family trip that combines the charm of a ranch getaway with the beauty of nature, consider Redbud Falls Ranch in North Texas.

      "1": "While I don’t/can’t eat food that is still moving…I understand that a lot of what we eat to live once moved…and we have to kill it unfortunately to eat and survive.\nBUT, apart from humans, most other animals on our planet have to eat live creatures to live. I know you give your pussy cat food out of a can or from the pet shop…but even cats and dogs will kill and eat anything which will keep them fed. What do you think fish and sea creatures live on?? (and it’s not the bait that you throw out on a fishing line!!)\nSo, although I, and a lot of our human race, find it hard to eat a living animal, there are still many who don't…or who can't afford not to…as it is their main way of getting food to survive.",
      "2": "Look at lettuce under a microscope. The plant cells are still functioning and living.\nYour salad is a living food.",
      "3": "Why do people eat foods that are still alive on their plates?\nMaybe it's because those foods taste good? There's also the nutritional benefits that are sometimes lost when those foods die or when they are cooked.\nHonestly, would you rather eat this when it's dead?\nOr while it's still alive?",
      "4": "Because nothing is better than the satisfying crunch of fresh celery right out of the garden.",
      "5": "I wouldn’t like to eat a dead oyster they go off so quickly fresh oysters with a little lemon juice and a twist of black pepper sublime.",
      "6": "Ah, the delicacy of still-living food. I could never understand why anybody would find eating something that is still squirming around their plates so appetizing. Then again, drinking wine made from fermented grapes made sense to me. I guess people like the excitement of watching something that’s still alive being immediately consumed. It’s both creepy and intriguing at the same time, I suppose.",
      "7": "If it is like the fried eel pieces still squirming on my plate, it only seems to be alive. I did not eat it anyway.",
      "8": "I rather like fermented pickles, as well as kimchi. I also have some whole yogurt in my fridge. All quite alive, all tasty.",

Call me naive!\nMany non-vegetarians I know will throw away the food even if there is a little bee alive in it, but would consume a dead cooked bird/animal. No offence to the creature!\nSo when Covid happened, there was a wide media coverage on the unbelievable food habits of South East Asians. That’s when I became aware of some people eating animals alive. Earlier I had always dismissed such stories as a hoax.\nIt’s commonly practised in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and other coastal countries.\nThe reasons are beyond my comprehension, and disgusts me as a human being thinking how messed up the taste buds are of some people around the world.\nBreathing Fish - In parts of Japan you can have your sashimi while it's still alive, and with a beating heart. Ikizukuri is a filleted fish that's served while the fish is still gasping for air. The mangled body is arranged on a plate with the live head used as decoration. For ethical reasons the dish is banned in many countries.\nSquirming Octopus - The Korean delicacy sannakji is a dish made from a small octopus that's chopped up and served to diners while it's still alive and squirming — patrons enjoy feeling the suckers (or suction cups on the octopus's arms) sticking to their tongues and throats while they chew.\nWormy Cheese - It's made when a fly lays its eggs on the cheese, the eggs hatch, and the larvae (or maggots) burrow into the cheese.\nChilled Ants - The ants are chilled hence won’t run out of your plate.\nJumping Shrimp - Popular in Japan and China. They remove the shell of baby shrimp and deep fry the body — it's traditionally eaten while the legs and antenna are still moving.\nFrog Sashimi - In some eastern countries, mainly China, Vietnam and Japan, you can eat live frogs served up filleted with their hearts still beating (and occasionally while their limbs are still moving). The dish is a delicacy and uses special bullfrogs raised for cooking.\nWormy Cheese 👆🏻 The rest of the images were too depressing to post.\nThe list isn’t exhaustive.\nThe reasons people resort to eating live animals could be…\nTradition in that culture\nFor the shock value\nA cruel mind\nMy husband’s friend narrated him this incidence from a restaurant in Japan where they served a bowl of seafood and heated it from below. The live animals in the bowl jumped with panic and that’s when they were caught and eaten by the customer.\nI guess this is the most sad answer I ever wrote.\nI hope this answer reaches many of those who aren’t aware of such practices, and steps are eventually taken to ban these foods on account of animal cruelty.\nThanks for the question Rick Wright.\nRead More: 8 Animals That Are Eaten Alive Around the World (Slideshow)\nMy IG food page veggie_central is all about spicy vegetarian food, which might interest you.

It needs another vote; but with the Russians and so-called DNR & LNR creeps off the streets.\nAlso it cannot be done until those who have been deported and ‘relocated’ have been found and returned. Otherwise the Russian-supported ‘authorities’ will just bus out anyone who they think will vote for UA.",

      "4": "Prior to the Russian invasion on Feb 24 I would have favoured Crimea being an independent nation in its own right. This would have been an even-handed solution to preserved the honour of both Ukraine and Russia and would probably have been in the best interests of the Crimean people as well.\nHowever Russia’s aggression has made this compromise solution unacceptable.\nThe first reason for this is the need to protect Ukraine’s security. At the outset of this war Russia used Crimea as a launch pad for their invasion, which demonstrates that having Russia control or influence this territory in any way would be a major threat to Ukraine. Ukraine needs to control Crimea for its protection against future Russian aggression.\nSecond, it is important that Russia is not allowed to gain anything at all from their aggression. This requires all former Ukrainian territory being returned to Ukraine.",
      "5": "Long before the Ukrainian forces seize “Crimea”, all Russian sympathizers will have self-evacuated. They already are doing exactly that - by ferry, or across the partially destroyed, Kerch bridge.\nThey all know by now the genocides performed by Russian forces in Bucha and elsewhere, they know the Ukrainian attitude about these instances, and no one supporting Putin will dare allow himself be caught.\nIt will resemble East Prussia at the end of WWII - any former German citizen who could flee, did so. Vastly many died, families and all, in the attempt, drowning, starving, etc.\nOr the guards at German WWII concentration and prison camps - the guards all fled, long before the Allied forces arrived.\nIf you were a Putin or Kremlin supporter, sitting in Crimea today, would you dare falling into the hands of Ukrainians???\nAnd long before the Ukrainian regular forces arrive, you will be at the mercy of the (enraged) locals, whom you have been persecuting (or at least they deduce this.)\nI predict they will all be long gone - if they can, at all, attempt to flee to safety.",
      "6": "While it’s true that the majority of Crimeans are ethnic Russians, this was the result of the Russians evicting many of the Tartars during the preceding century and a half and replacing them with Russians.\nBut “hostile to them”?\nThe assumption that the residents of Crimea would welcome the Russian takeover in February 2014 is something Putin knew to be false even before 2014. Up to 2013, public polling showed strong public support for keeping Crimea part of Ukraine. To quote from this source\n, “What happened in February–March 2014 was a full-spectrum military operation executed on land and at sea and supplemented by sustained and targeted anti-Ukraine information operations.[1] Finally, when a referendum was held – in effect at gunpoint – on 16 March 2014 to legitimize Russia’s takeover of Crimea, the Kremlin hijacked the principle of self-determination. Public opinion polling prior to Russia’s aggressive disinformation campaign spoke clearly in favour of Crimea remaining part of Ukraine.[2] Yet ahead of the vote, those who supported remaining within Ukraine could not campaign freely. The ballot also excluded the option for Crimea to remain part of Ukraine as an autonomous republic, i.e. according to the constitution in force. Furthermore, the Kremlin substantially inflated voter turnout. While it said that 82 per cent of voters had cast their ballots, a member of Russia’s presidential Civil Society and Human Rights Council reported that turnout was likely to have totalled 30–50 per cent.[3] Election fraud such as multiple voting was also reported.”\nPutin surely knew that Kyiv would not welcome his “special military operation” in 2022 with open arms, and it is therefore puzzling that he did not prepare his troops for an unfriendly welcome. So the element of surprise that so disadvantaged the invaders is as much Putin’s doing as the Ukrainians’, if not more so. Crimea in 2014 was much the same.\n[1] Russia struck Ukraine when it was at its most vulnerable, with a vacuum of power in Kyiv post-Euromaidan. The annexation strategy was three-pronged. First, Russia executed sustained and targeted information operations, which began after the Euromaidan revolution and continued all the way through the process of annexation. Russia spread anti-Ukrainian sentiment, sought to instill fear of the new government in Kyiv, and aimed to polarize Crimea’s population by pitting Russian speakers against Crimean Tatars and anyone opposing Russia’s takeover of the peninsula. Second, starting from 20 February 2014, it deployed both military and paramilitary units to capture administrative buildings. At different times, more than 30,000 military personnel were involved in the operation. Finally, on 16 March 2014 Russia forced the holding of a referendum to legitimize the takeover.\n[2] An opinion poll in May 2013 found that 53 per cent of respondents wanted to maintain the status quo and saw the peninsula as part of Ukraine. Only 23 per cent said they would vote for Crimea to be separated from Ukraine and united with Russia.

      "8": "Khersons liberation means Crimea itself is now in range of Ukrainian artillery assets. It also means up to 100,000 battle hardened troops are now available for Ukraine to use and redploy.\nAlso telling is that Russia chose to retreat rather than turn Kherson into a killing ground. It needed its troops more than it needed Ukraines soldiers killed…further evidence of its logitistical and manpower shortcomings.\nAll of this is further evidence that Crimeas liberation is simply a matter of time.\nSo…what should Ukraine do with the people who live there? Well, Russian soldiers should become PoWs. Their families…brought from Russia…should be sent back. Russians guilty of warcrimes…or who took part in the false flag invasion, or the forced “Referendum”…should be tried.\n“Russian” troops and officials who used to be Ukrainian should be tried for treason.\nAs for the rest…they should be offered a free choice. To be either Ukrainian or Russian. And if they choose Russia, they should get a free train ticket and a cargo allowance. Ethnic cleansing isn’t something that should happen, but given the circumstances it seems unlikely many currently living in Crimea will relish life under Ukraines rule. And it seems likely many of those will have already fled…indeed, many already have, selling off their dachas at firesale prices.\nMany will stay, but there will always be an air of suspicion surrounding them. Many of those forced out by the Russian invaders will return and will assume positions of privilege simply because Kyev trusts them. This is turn will fuel resentment among the collaborators which will cause problems for Ukraine for decades.\nEthnic cleansing is a crime Ukraine is sadly likely to embrace and excuse as a necessity. But it will likely (mostly) be voluntary…people fleeing an army…rather than forced.\nFor the rest, Ukraine should treat them well. It should respect their culture, to ensure they feel as little resentment as possible, but also ensure Ukrainian culture is prioritised. Crimea will be halfway between an occupation and a liberation…many DID welcome the Russian invaders, just as many DID vote to be annexed by Russia…and these problems cannot be wished away. The removal of Russian troops, and the ejection of the hardliners who collaborated will mitigate the problems, but not remove them.\nOne lesson to be learnt is from Iraq and the US. Crimean firms should be handed contracts for rebuilding. People are less likely to destroy something they built, and workers employed usefully are often too busy and fatigued to cause trouble.\nAnother lesson is that of an amnesty. Barring certain crimes, Crimea should be forgiven, even if it can’t be forgotten. Not everything can be overlooked though\nAnd of course, Ukraine will need a heavy military and police presence to provide security. Sevastopol will become a major military base, and probable main base for Ukraines rebuilt fleet. If Ukraine joins NATO, there will likely be an even bigger military presence and that means more money and investment. The Kerch bridge will end up being dismantled…Ukraine will most likely render it unusable to heavy traffic anyway as part of its liberation plan.\nUkraine should take a softly, softly approach to win back the trust and to ensure Crimeans feel they still have a place in Ukraine. But it’s going to be years before Ukrainians see “I’m from Crimea” as anything other than bad.\nWinning the war may yet prove to be easier than winning the peace.",
      "9": "You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Crimea existed prior to Russia invading and illegally annexing it in 2014.\nCrimea was a semi-autonomous state of Ukraine. There was no overwhelming control by Ukraine. It was considered by the world (including Russia) to be part of Ukraine.",
      "10": "In may 2014 a Gallup poll of the residents of Crimea had these preferences -\n53% preferred an autonomous Crimea with its own parliament and president as part of Ukraine\n22% preferred to be part of Russia\n20% preferred an independent sovereign state.\nAt the time Crimea had tourism offices in European cities and was looking forward to a great future. These conditions can be recreated. Russia settled 500,000 people into Crimea after 2014. They may prefer to return to Russia.",
      "11": "According to the latest census data available (2001), Crimea ethnicall composition was as follows:\nRussian 58%\nUkrainian 24%\nTatar 12%\nAlso, before the Russian invasion, Crimea enjoied a great degree of autonomy. It had it’s own Constitution, Parliament and it’s own Government, although still subject to Ukraine’s Constitution which prevailed in conflicting issues.\nThat will probablly be their status once Ukraine liberates Crimea. So the Russians that want to stay will stay, those who want to leave will leave.",
      "12": "That is 100% false. A total Kremlin/Pukin propaganda lie. In fact, it's the false premise upon which is built this entire Pukin propaganda house of cards.\nToday, most of the “Russians\" in Crimea are actually Russian expats, with Russian citizenship and Russian passports. They're not Ukrainian citizens. They have no national rights in Ukraine and can simply be deported, the same way any sovereign nation can deport any undesirable aliens. Further, Ukrainian citizens in Crimea, who have pledged their loyalty to a foreign power, are traitors, insurrectionists and secessionists. They can be arrested and tried for treason. That is against the law in, literally, every nation on Earth. There is no right under international or Ukrainian law to decide you want your region to be part of another country. The very idea of that is just incredibly stupid.\nAnd, in closing, many loyal Ukrainian citizens fled Crimea after the invasion for safer places to live. When/If they return, it will further dilute your lies. The Russian propagandists said the same kinds of things about other regions of eastern and southern Ukraine, yet, STRANGELY, everywhere that is liberated by Ukraine, the local citizens, who remain and are still alive, turn out in droves to greet the Ukrainian soldiers like Paris in 1944. I guess they're not all Russians or traitors, are they?",

Just let the people of Crimea vote again on where they want to belong to under actually fair conditions.\nIf the original „referendum“ wasn’t a sham, Russia would have nothing to fear from repeating it. As it would show that most Crimeans actually want to be Russians. And many Russians would be spared their life.\nAnd if Ukraine was right in calling it a sham, a repeat with fair conditions will show it decidedly. And prove that Crimea is a part of Ukraine, having been illegally annexed by Russia.\nIts a win-win.\nAnd the fact that Russia is not using that option to save thousands of its loyal soldiers, is highly indicative of the initial referendum being a sham.",

Fly it? Probably not the whole way or by the time it gets there you have to replace the engine or strip it down and rebuild it. And you have to bring in entire fleets of Loadstars with new engines and parts and manuals and special socket wrenches and so on and on and on… and all that shit has to be stored somewhere properly so it can be found and used. It’s not like your workbench at home where you scrounge through a pile of oily tools dumped in a pile for a 3/8 inch socket.\nSo you’re not only giving the plane, you’re providing training to pilots, intelligent and capable and motivated mechanics, fuelers, tow jockeys and all down the list. How long does that take?\nLet’s say the US says, “Hey, we are going to give you a squadron of F5A that we have that are no longer any use to us.” How long do you think it takes to deliver the planes, assemble and catalog on the parts, load them, deliver them, collate and curate them, make a library of manuals, find the capable mechanics, train them, and so on?

These gave Kyiv a longer range artillery piece than the Russian equivalent, it is also accurate to a fault but also a relatively limited range. (About 40 klicks KM)\nHIMARS MLRS This is rocket artillery, also more advanced than it's Russian equivalent, better range, more accurate. This allows Kyiv to strike more strategically important targets rather than the tactical usefulness of the aforementioned weapons.\nNOTE that there are several types of missile for HIMARS. Kyiv was not given the longest range missile (about 200km[?] range). They got the next best, but still very effective and accurate (80km)\nThe trend here is that all of these weapons, while undoubtedly important, do not offer extremely long ranges with which the Ukrainians might attack deep into Russian territory and hit those really juicy strategic targets: airfields, rail links, fuel dépôts, command posts, etc. These weapons are for fighting the ground war which is obviously the backbone of any military campaign.\nYou do NOT control territory until you have boots on the ground.\nNOW\nHARM air to surface missiles. These are anti-radiation missiles. That doesn't mean anti nuclear it means anti-radar. The missiles target anti-aircraft missile systems.\nThe real answer to the question. Russia tried at the very start to destroy Ukrainian IADS (integrated air defense system). They did this so they could own the sky. That is very important. Air supremacy. With the war entering it's next phase, it would be immeasurably helpful for Kyiv not just to keep their airspace relatively clear, but to destroy the Russian air-defenses and then own the sky themselves. Whoever owns the skies has a huge tactical and strategic advantage. If the west provided newer 4th and 5th gen (doubtful) aircraft Ukraine could not just clear the remnants of Russia's airforce and IADS, but also have free reign to conduct ground attacks to support troop advances. With it I believe Ukraine would make short work of what is left of the invaders in their territory. What everybody is afraid of is those weapons being turned on Russia inside Russian territory. I'm not saying they don't deserve it, Putin does. But if Russians in Russian territory start being attacked Russia will go insane and the war will go on and on. Who knows what the end result would be?\nEDIT: Also, providing an whole new type of aircraft, let alone more than one type, perhaps from different countries, would be logistically INSANE. Maintenance, repairs, spare parts, trained mechanics, all this would need to be provided. Perhaps if one type of aircraft, say the F-16 or 18 (several NATO countries that provide aid to Ukraine use these versatile aircraft) were provided, it would still be incredibly difficult to orchestrate, especially during a war where the enemy can strike anywhere in the country with relative impunity. All this expertise would need to be provided. Either training Ukrainians to fly, maintain, repair, arm, fuel, and integrate or provide these specialists… see the problem here? All that being said, I would like to see Ukraine outfitted with the means to destroy their invaders AND see off any future aggression. The very best case scenario is that when Russia loses Putin is deposed (or killed) and his regime is entirely removed and replaced with an actual democracy. This isn't so far fetched since they are already ostensibly a democracy anyway. :)",
      "21": "I think they should. I think the whole of the western world should do what they can. The Russian invasion (good old soviet style land grab) has had far reaching consequences throughout Europe. Here in the UK, natural gas prices have went into orbit, electricity has went up as well. The price of everyday items, groceries, toiletries etc: is crazy. I appreciate, not all of this is down to the Russian invasion, but, most of it is. As people who live in the democratic west, I feel that we have a duty to help our fellow democracy with aid in the form of money, and, the best military technology we can give. Give what you can.",
      "22": "The US should provide fighter jets to Ukraine, those offered by Poland to start, and F 16s",
      "23": "I think the us should send older variants of f-16 fighters and older munitions(so the us doesn’t deplete main reserves), but the big issue is training and parts. Training the pilots, but also training maintenance crews. The US planes are completely different then the Soviet aircraft so it would take months to train an effective force of pilots and maintenance crews. They will also need spare parts which the US won’t be happy with as the US needs spare parts for its own jets. So while I think it can be a good idea, it would be very difficult to pull off.",
      "24": "Yes, and F-16s will do nicely, for now.\nBut soon, true air supremacy will be required, and that will call for upgraded fighters just to establish simple security.\nAnd training will be required, which should already be underway.",
      "25": "If America wants to see an end to the conflict in Ukraine then the addition of fighter aircraft would certainly be a huge plus.\nPersonally I would give them any weapons they ask for this is a fight about right and wrong and everybody knows Russia are in the wrong including the Russian military.",
      "26": "in a war that has now lasted 6 months, Western fighter jets become a overwhelming necessity. Many former Warsaw block nations have transitioned to Western equipment quickly. And Ukraine can do that as well, all arguments regarding logistics, training etc. have expired since June.\nThe immediate need was MIG and SU, since this help was denied to assure maximum destruction and death, the need has changed.",
      "27": "From what I’ve read by Retired General Petraeus, if Russia uses a nuke during this Ukraine matter, the US would lead a coalition of nations to invade Ukraine with ground troops and kill all Russian invaders. The use of US planes supporting our troops would be assumed.",
      "28": "No. The Ukrainians don't have time to learn to fly US fighter jets. The US should provide US jets to NATO allies such as Poland which still use Soviet model jets, and those Soviet jets should be given to Ukraine.",
      "29": "Yes though in the immediate future it would have to be airframe they're trained on. I do think that some pilots and ground crews should be training on NATO planes so if the war persists NATO members can provide better air frames.",
      "30": "I believe the US/NATO and US-allies should provide Ukraine with everything the later needs in order to defeat Russia as fast and as hard as possible.",
      "31": "Ukraine seems to be managing pretty well without F-35s or whatever. Besides, to get the best out of a new type of jet a pilot would have to train on it for months, and Ukraine can’t afford the time.\nAlso, remember that the weapons and material being sent to Ukraine are not front line stuff. They are out of reserves or stockpiles and often shortly to be disposed of. Stuff the western nations can afford to donate. Not many modern jets to be found there.\nHaving said that, I did read that a bunch of early model F-16s were being made available. Whether that would enhance the UAF is not clear. Also, there are proposals to donate the whole of the USAF’s A-10 fleet to Ukraine. The A-10s are over 30 years old and the USAF has been trying to get rid of them for years, but prevented by Congress.\nSo, on balance, no. The US should not deliver fighters to Ukraine. The Ukraine doesn’t need them, it would take too long to train the pilots on them, and there aren’t any immediately available anyway.",
      "32": "Giving fighter jets is not like giving artillery, tanks or himars missiles which in operation can be faster in mastery. Unlike fighter planes. Delivering fighter jets to Ukraine takes a lot of time considering that Ukrainian pilots are used to using Soviet-era aircraft technology which is clearly different from the west. Instead of being able to beat Russia, there is even a risk of the plane crashing due to human error.",
      "33": "Not sure if the US should or not. Bringing strong tensions of Russia & the USA wouldn’t be good. But Ukraine needs allies' aid. Support should be provided but planned good.",
      "34": "They should not.\nThe OP hails probably from medieval times. A club, some stick, a kick in the pants and you were as ready as possible for the army. Even in those days that proved very costly. Archers would start as kids. The saying was that an archer took two generations, mostly because shooting takes dedication from family and a genetic propensity.\nThat is even more true for modern hardware. Nobody can fly a drone in one day. It takes months to safely take off with a bomb loaden drone, drop it at the right location and bring it back home without giving away your own position.\nBy the time the Ukraine pilots can safely fly an American jet fighter we talk a year or longer. For them to fight efficiently, escape rockets, arrive at the correct spot flying low and without crashing into each other or powerlines… we talk years. Now I believe a lot, not that the Russians can hold on for more than two years.\nSo keep the jets. Instead send himars",
      "35": "As I understand matters, the greatest barrier to providing Ukraine with fighter aircraft of a new type is not the fact that they would be new to Ukrainian pilots (as many people argue). Afterall, they are already highly experienced and qualified jet pilots. Of course, if they were brand new recruits, it would certainly take longer to get them up scratch but the biggest challenge according to some experts that I have recently listened to, is the time that it takes to train pilots on the full array of weapons that would be available to them.\nConsidering this, some call for training to begin as soon as possible, regardless of whether or not the war lasts long enough to require the aircraft for combat missions. Afterall, that would allow the new aircraft to see combat if necessary and to be delivered swiftly after the war (bolstering Ukraine’s deterent power) if it is not. Personally, I would support this approach because it seems sensible to do as much as possible to support Ukraine, if we are going to continue to support them.\nHalf-hearted efforts risk disaster, whilst also risking the waste of all the efforts to aid Ukraine so far. The war is far from over, even if Russia has lost the initiative and appears to be on the defensive for the time being. Wars are unpredictable and there have been many conventions of modern warfare that were broken by Russia so far (i.e. the use of cluster bombs, remote mine laying over wide civilian areas, the torture, kidnapping and murder of civilians, instigating nuclear crises, and targeting civilian infrastructure after the Kharkiv collapse), so it is clear that it is impossible to predict the events of the war with perfect clarity; a point that is reinforced by Ukraine’s sudden counter-offensive success.\nConsequently, the Ukrainians’ current airframe fleet continues to be used and upgraded with new capabilities in an effort to not only continue to take the fight to the Russians but to grow Ukraine’s air-power capabilities. As a humble would-be pundit, I think that this approach makes sense and should continue regardless of whether or not new aircraft are offered to Ukraine. Every caability that they can get in the fight, and as soon as it is possible to do so, will make a difference on the ground and could save civilian lives, whilst helping to shorten the war. Besides, the Ukrainians’ current aircraft don’t necessarilly have to be retired as soon as they possess new fighters but they could continue to serve for as long as they required, or able, to do so.",
      "36": "Yes they should, Ukraine is fighting for democracy and for valuable things for all civilized world",
      "37": "Should not because we run the risk of Russia mistaking them for actually American jets and we all know how that will end up. Better to replace the ex Eastern block countries MIGs with American jets and give their old MIGs to Ukraine, save time on retraining Ukrainian pilots also. They could go straight into action.",
      "38": "Yes should provide jets only more for a defensive purpose , since any escalation on the part of Ukraine would only ignite another set of deadly retalitions of some kind from the Russians, an already retreating army.\nEnough damage has been done to Ukraine & batterd the economy of both the countries. But now all the blood shed & loss of human lives must stop immeditely & the war should end in a dignified manner for both the nations.",
      "39": "That would be a choice to either provide fighter jets to Ukraine or send US Air Force into Ukraine. I would opt for US providing some jets.",
      "40": "No.\nThere are a few reasons for my answer. First of, why? Not like Russia completely dominates the sky and Ukraine urgently requires additional aircraft to defend or counter-attack. Second, there is always that nuclear risk to discuss. Third, at this point, a stronger air force for Ukraine seems more morale risk than effective tools.\nFirst thing first, ok, is Ukraine in Izyum or not? Seriously, their counter-offensives are progressing faster than news can report to me. And how is Kherson, exactly?\nI mean, it's not like Ukraine has been sitting duck without Western warplanes. In April, they defeated Russia in both Kyiv and Kharkiv. And now, again, if more people can post photos into social media about Izyum and Kherson, I would really appreciate it. Russia took more than a month to take Mariupol. They have been fighting around Donetsk and Bakhmut since July or something. As far as I can know, seems like Russia can no longer cross Dnipro to defend Kherson. And can somebody post more pictures from Izyum?\nSo… Ukraine is rocking this. Their air force still attacked command and supply depots. Their coast guard (I guess?) already sunk flag ship of Black Sea fleet. It's not like they need anything else.\nSecondly, as I professed elsewhere, an overly rapid Ukrainian victory is a global security risk. Putin, likes it or not, is the devil we know. A collapsing Russian regime is a devil we don't know.\nUnfortunate for us, that devil controls about 40% of world nuclear weapons. Not something I want to play around with.\nSlow and steady would be ideal Ukrainian success. Slow so Putin can keep a lid on his side. Steady so they will ultimately prevail.\nFinally, frankly, at this point, I feel like an advanced air force is an unnecessary distraction for Ukrainian military.\nAgain, they have done a phenomenal job. Dear goodness if they take and hold Izyum and Kherson, Russia is basically done for. And they didn't need F-16 to do it.\nOn the other hand, an advanced air force isn't cheap. And I don't mean acquisition cost. 4th gen warcrafts costs an arm and a leg to maintain. 5th gen also requires your first born, your house, and maybe your blood also. Can Ukraine afford that?\nAlso, this would raise unnecessary expectations. Right now, Ukrainian air force is David against the Goliath of Russian air force. Their staying alive was enough of a morale lift. Once they receive reinforcement, though, the expectation changes. Now people will expect stuffs like domination of the sky (at least over West Ukraine). And let's be realistic, training alone would take months. Ukraine should lower expectations, not raise it.\nThe conclusion is simple: Ukraine doesn't need more warplanes at this point, especially not stuffs like F-16. They need to maintain capacity, for sure. So the answer is no to the question.",
      "41": "I absolutely think the US should provide training and fighter planes to Ukraine. A combination of F-16s and few F-15s. I also think we should allow Ukraine into NATO whenever they ask again.They also need longer range missiles. The US to be direct needs to wake up and realize this idea that something is a step too far and the Russians will do something scary is nonsense. We've stepped far over any line we shouldn't give them nukes beyond that Vladimir Putin's son of a train whore opinion is invalid.",
      "42": "There a war going on.. to introduce a new aircraft weapon system will take 5–6 years before it is fully operational. Even if the aircrafts are already manufactured and can be provided tomorrow\nYes, the implementation should have started in 2014.",
      "43": "I think they should have provided them in the Trump administration, if not the Obama admin. We scrap or retire lots of older F15’s and F-16’s that are as good as or better than many of the planes Russia is flying.",
      "44": "The USAF should transfer recently retired A-10 close support aircraft to Ukraine. These attack planes should be very effective against Russian ground forces. They are also less sophisticated than American air superiority fighters (such as F-15 and F-16) because they use analog instruments instead of digital displays. This makes transition training for Ukrainian pilots faster. Additionally, the A-10 is much more rugged than fighter planes and its support elements are designed to be deployed on small and unprepared airfields. Ukraine could also make good use of Harrier jump jets that are being retired by the US Marines, but transition to vertical take-off and landing might take longer.",
      "45": "No impractical",
      "46": "They don’t have to come directly from US but jets certainly should be engaged to help end this nightmare. What the hell is the West waiting for??? Again,afraid of a fat,bald old man who is nothing more than a coward hiding in some bunker.",
      "47": "F16 and F15 wings would have the Orks running home before breakfast. Putin threatened consequences if they were supplied to Ukraine just as he promised if the west supplied modern weaponary like the HIMARS that are performing so well. They will ultimately be supplied but that will require pilot and ground handling staff trained for aircraft type and that unfortunately will take months.",
      "48": "Well it looks as though the pilots will be trained on them and America will be supplying the jets. All thanks to America - again.",
      "49": "Yes, the Ukrainians need them. If the war lasts long enough to train new F-16 pilots then go ahead. If not them send the Mig-29s that are in NATO hands.",
      "50": "No need to, NATO members already send fighters from the Soviet Union era that they have in stock , the U.S is part of NATO transferred helicopters previously for the Afghan National army to the Ukrainians. It took years for the Poles to train and master the 4th generation fighter like the F16 and the ground forces to be in NATO standards."

Russia invaded Ukraine, and USA had promised to help Ukraine in the case Russia would invade or falsely annex any part of Ukraine given to Ukraine in exchange to nuclear weapons give to Russia.",
      "28": "There is no “proxy war”, Igor. Your shabby excuse of a country is losing against the decision and will of the Ukrainians to be Europeans rather than vassals of a barbarian thug state. In an actual proxy war against Western powers Russia, which generates a smaller GDP than Texas, would quickly lose and suffer its worst humiliation ever because Ukraine would be supplied with plenty of the newest Western hardware.\nBy the way, what does this have to do with Biden? Screw your shoddy Kremlin sponsored conspiracy theories. A number of countries independently decided to aid Ukraine and/or support sanctions on Russia because it was the ethically right thing to do. If you don’t understand what I mean, look up ethics in a dictionary, but honestly I don’t expect much wit of submissive Russian serfs who are used to everything being shit or turning into shit.",
      "29": "I imagine that Ukraine will continue to aggressively defend itself against the Russian invaders until Russia ceases to pose a threat to the Ukrainian people. This is the fun fact about peace treaties, they only work if both sides can trust each other and unfortunately Russia has shown that they cannot be trusted, therefore, this war continues until Russia's unconditional surrender. Ukraine knows that if they stop before Russia is neutralised, it will only be a reprieve until Russia has regrouped and attacks again. Russia can easily bring about peace with their unconditional surrender. Ukraine doesn't have that luxury - That's the problem with going straight in with genocide of the Ukrainian people, Ukraine have no motivation to surrender.",
      "30": "This proxy war was started by Biden, having the Russians invade Ukraine. That was very evil of Biden! He shouldn't have done that.\nBut Zelensky is to blame as well, because by being so provocatively president of Ukraine and refusing to be a Russian, he left Putin no other choice!\nUkraine should apologize to Russia and pay reparations for all the munitions Russia has spent bombing them.\nThis is a proxy war alright!",

      "34": "Either until Ukrainian regime will get sober and realize they’re about to suicide themselves and resume diplomacy with Russia, or until Ukraine will completely collapse, which could happen rather soon after their “dreadful” offensive with expected Russian counterattack, or a bit longer if that offensive never happens.\nIt all will depend on Zelensky.\nAs for Biden? I guess for him there’s only one choice remains: to chew or not to chew his necktie."

    "answers": {
      "1": "The time it takes to drive 100 miles depends on your speed. If you are driving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour (mph), it would take approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to cover 100 miles. However, if you are driving at a different speed, the time will vary accordingly. Always obey speed limits and drive at a safe and legal speed for the road conditions.",
      "2": "What are you driving?\nA car, a bulldozer, a truck, a semi, a motorbike, a farmers tractor, a combine harvester, a team of horses, a boat?\nWhat roads are you using?\nFreeways, city streets, suburban side streets, dirt tracks, a river?",
      "3": "Drive at 55 miles per hour…oh look…your answer",
      "4": "The answer depends on your average speed. If your entire journey is on a motorway at the 70mph speed limit, you'll do it in a bit less than an hour and a half. If your journey does include motorway driving and is largely on urban and suburban roads, you may average just over 30mph and take about three hours to do the journey.",
      "5": "Hello,\nTo calculate questions involving travel we require two pieces of information out of three.The other remaining piece of information can be calculated to provide a answer for you.\nTake this single piece of information provided is the Distance only 100 MILES.\nDistance = 100 miles if you state that you wanted to complete the journey in 2 hours or you could say that your average Speed is 50 mph.\nDistance = 100 miles, Time = 4 hours, Therefore the average Speed was 25 mph.\nNow if we have the Distance 100 miles and the Speed was 50 mph. The Time therefore would be 2 hours\nNow Speed = 70 mph. Time 3 hours and 30 minutes ,& Distance = 3 hours = 210miles + 35 miles = 245 miles.\nSo you can see from the examples above with must 2 pieces of information you can find out the other piece of information. So its Speed, Distance and Time that you can calculate the answer to your question.",

      "8": "The original question was: How long does it take to cycle 100 miles? You’ll have to ask the Quora bots why it got merged.\nThat depends on a variety of factors such as: the rider, the bike, the terrain and the purpose. The peloton in the Tour de France can cover 100 miles in around 4 hours on a flat stage. A strong rider riding a century and aiming for a fast time will probably be able to do it in a bit less than 6 hours. Most others will be slower. As a rule of thumb, a person can generally go 3 times the distance of their usual training ride in a day so to train for a century you’ll want to work up to 30+ mile rides.",
      "9": "Depends on local speed limits, road condition, and weather.\nIn Germany, if you drive through some stretch of an autobahn that still has no speed limit imposed whatsoever, driving 160 kilometres may take about 35–40 minutes, but I'm not sure if there still are unrestricted autobahn stretches that long, so let's say it's one hour in that case.\nIn the EU+Switzerland+Norway in general the highway speed limit is 130 km/h, so without hindrances it will take about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but I'd say it is rather 1 hour 35 minutes.\nOn general roads with 90 km/h speed limit in Europe (outside the EU as well) it takes about 2 hours.\nEuropean rule of thumb may be applied to China, South Korea, and Japan.\nIn Russia, road condition permitting, the general speed limit is either 60 or 90 km/h (plus 20 km/h non-fined excess as of August 2021, so practically 80 to 110 km/h), so you may count on covering that kind of distance in about 2.5 hours, and even less than 2 hours on M4 and M11 highways, particularly if you have a transponder for toll gates. Yet, Russian roads are mostly not quite good still, so 3 hours for 160 km seems to be more realistic.\nIn the USA, general speed limit on highways is 55 to 65 mph, on some highways in Texas it's 85 mph, so it's anywhere between 2 and 3 hours. Up to 4 hours if you drive through towns and cities.\nOn lower-class roads it will be 3 to 5 hours. If the road is in extremely poor condition, that may take up to 16 hours.\nIf you take all roads of the world and make some average of them, I guess five hours would be a fair guess (32 km/h mean speed)\nA cyclist can cover that kind of distance in 4 (racing bike on a flatland with excellent pavement and no headwind) to 12 hours (heavy road bike with rack bags on both wheels, on a road with many ascends and/or headwind/crosswinds).\nA 160 km walk along El Camino de Santiago will take an average person 4 days, 5 days at a leisurely pace, and a trained walker about 2.5 days.",

      "18": "around 1 hour and 40 minuites to 1 hour 20 minutes.\nbecause 60mph is not 60 miles an hour. it is actually more like 70–75mph equal to 60 miles in hour.\nwhy i do not know. but i have tested it. which makes no sense.",
      "19": "I can answer that from my own experiences. Each year I do a charity ride to raise money for MS. The ride is 100 miles. The terrain is pretty flat (goes through NJ). I’m not a pro cyclist but am able to average 14 mph. If I rode the whole way, without stopping, it would take about 7 hours. However, there are 6 rest stops for the riders along the way. The rest stops have potties, snacks, Gatoraide, bananas, and bike mechanics. I stop at each one to fill my water bottles, grab a fast bite, stretch my legs, and hop back on the bike. Figure 10 minutes at each stop. So, that adds at least another hour to the trip. So, altogether, biking the 100 miles is 7 hours of saddle time, 60 minutes at the rest stops, for a total of about 8 hours. Sometimes, I hook up with a pace line which boosts my average speed to about 18 mph which shortens the saddle time a bit.",
      "20": "I have a friend who once did 100 miles in just over 5 hours, so about 20 MPH. But he was REALLY tired at the end.\nFor me, it would take closer to 7 hours (15 MPH average), but only if I trained up for it. Which I have done a couple of times.\nHeat and wind make a difference. Best temperature for me would be 70 degrees and partly cloudy. Wind? None, preferably, because a tail wind one way is usually a head wind the other.",

The tank was pushed 130 metres down the line and was obviously damaged, though the hull of the tank seems to have held up well. I can only imagine the carnage would be worse if a modern main battle tank weighing anywhere up to 75 tonnes were involved in a modern collision, though obviously the greatest factor will be related to the velocity of the train.\nForst Zinna rail disaster - Wikipedia\nThe Forst Zinna rail disaster occurred 19 January 1988 in Forst Zinna , East Germany . It was the result of a collision between a Soviet T-64A tank and an express train on the Berlin–Halle railway , in an area often used by the Soviet military for tank training. [1] [2] Six people were killed, and 33 were injured. It was one of the worst railway accidents in the history of the GDR. [3] Disaster Edit The train involved in the accident was a DR Class 211 locomotive pulling twelve passenger cars and a restaurant car. The driver of the T-64A tank was 19 years old and undergoing training by a 20-year-old instructor. This was the trainee's first time driving the tank, and it was dark outside. [4] The instructor called to the trainee to turn right, but this was not heard by the driver, who did not realise they were heading towards the busy rail line. When the instructor's emergency engine shutdown switch finally activated, the tank became stuck on the rail line. [4] As the crew heard the sound of an oncoming train, they abandoned the tank. Seconds later, the train collided with the tank at 110 km/h. The collision instantly killed both drivers of the train, pushing the tank 130 metres forward. Aftermath Edit The soldiers were initially arrested and questioned by the Kriminalpolizei , an unprecedented event at that time. Relations between the GDR and USSR were already strained due to disagreements between the policies of Erich Honecker and Mikhail Gorbachev . The police report directly blamed the Soviets, concluding that the train driver would not have been able to stop the train in time. [1] However, the soldiers were nonetheless tried by a military tribunal of the Soviet Army . [1] [4] The area would later have dragon's teeth added to the areas near the rail track to prevent further incidents of tanks crossing onto the rail line.

    "title": "Could the conflict in Ukraine lead to a coup or internal reshuffling in Russia",
    "answers": {
      "1": "The possibility of a coup or internal reshuffling in Russia as a result of the conflict in Ukraine is a complex and nuanced one. There are a number of factors that could lead to such an outcome, including the following:\nThe cost of the war. The war in Ukraine has been a major financial burden on Russia, and it is possible that the economic impact of the war could lead to dissatisfaction among the Russian people and elite. If this dissatisfaction reaches a certain level, it could create an opening for a coup or internal reshuffling.\nThe military performance of Russia. The Russian military has not performed as well as expected in Ukraine, and this has led to growing criticism of the military and its leadership. If the military continues to perform poorly, it could lead to a loss of confidence in the government and make it more vulnerable to a coup or internal reshuffling.\nThe popularity of President Vladimir Putin. President Putin's popularity has declined significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine. If this trend continues, it could undermine his legitimacy as a leader and make him more vulnerable to a coup or internal reshuffling.\nThe level of support for the war among the Russian people. Public support for the war in Ukraine is still relatively high in Russia, but it is possible that this support could erode over time, especially if the war continues to drag on. If public support for the war declines significantly, it could make it more difficult for the government to maintain its legitimacy and make it more vulnerable to a coup or internal reshuffling.\nIt is important to note that these are just some of the factors that could lead to a coup or internal reshuffling in Russia. It is also important to note that such an outcome is not inevitable. The Russian government has a number of tools at its disposal to suppress dissent and maintain its grip on power. However, if the factors listed above continue to develop in a negative way, it is possible that they could lead to a change in leadership in Russia.",
      "2": "You got your answer at the end of June 2023 when Prigozhin, who Putin did, betrayed him by attempting a coup to take power in Moscow.\nIn the Kremlin, there was panic. Everyone fled, Putin in the lead, to take shelter.\nThe coup was stopped quickly with the help of Lukashenko. Realize the humiliation for Putin to see his Belarusian puppet save the day like this...\nPutin finally took revenge 2 months later by shooting down Prigozhin’s plane.\nHowever, this does not mean that a coup to overthrow the Kremlin dictator will not take place. Supporters of the Wagner group remain numerous. There are more and more supporters of an even harder line than that of Putin.\nIf the 2024 elections in Russia were held democratically, it would even be possible to see a candidate representing this even more extremist fringe than Putin reach 20%.\nThis clearly indicates that even if Putin were overthrown, this war in Ukraine would be far from over!\nThe best thing for Ukraine to do therefore remains the same: fight to inflict a humiliating defeat on Putin's Russia and leave it no option for the future except to stay at home and finance the reconstruction of the country.

Or better, could have happened: If Putin’s “SMO” would have fared worse, if there would be the danger that Russia could lose the war, then hardliners and ultranationalists in the military and secret service world could have taken over from Putin. But as Russia looks like winning the war, the coup dangers have been faded away, I would say."

Putin’s lickspittles are trying to come up with any sort of justification for using nuclear weapons, so they can pretend it isn’t Russia’s fault. But it IS Russia’s fault, they’re the aggressors who keep talking about nuclear weapons. Furthermore, Russia won’t actually use nuclear weapons, everyone, including the Russians, knows it would be the end of Russia. They’re just suffering from some sort of oral flatulence, trying to talk big, because their military is walking so small in Ukraine. Putin has spoken many times about not crossing various dangerous lines like not giving Ukraine weapons, not giving Ukraine air defense systems, not giving Ukraine main battle tanks, not giving Ukraine missiles, not giving Ukraine fighter jets, etc. But when someone crosses them, he just draws another line further back, and talks about not crossing the new dangerous line.",

Above: In a 1960's photo, government scientists examine a mock-up of the warhead of a W-48 155mm nuclear artillery shell.

And it’ll be replaced by a newer attempt of these failed tactic in another week.\nObviously, if you think about it for five seconds, if the intent of the U.S. was to embark upon nuclear war, they would not need F-16s destroying Russia’s remnants of an “air force” to do so.

      "8": "Firstly of course not! Second, that is a charged question with a lot of lead! Let’s Analyze this from several perspective:\n\n1. Would US want a nuclear war in Ukraine?\nFrom an economical standpoint, war in Ukraine has been devastating to the world. Ukraine provides Iron Ore ($6.83B), Seed Oils ($6.34B), Wheat ($5.87B), Corn ($5.86B), and Semi-Finished Iron ($4.08B). While 1 of those is a direct competitor to U.S (Corn), ALL of the rest are competitors to Russia. So as far as reasons go, Russia seem to have a better reason than U.S to disrupt the Ukrainian economy.\nFrom a geographical standpoint, Ukraine is right next to a lot of NATO countries. A nuclear war in Ukraine means a nuclear winter in the region. Radio active dust and pollutants in the air, water, food for everyone in Europe. That means famine, illness, and death for a lot of NATO countries.\nFrom a political standpoint, from a list of Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Ukraine is one of very few western friendly Slavic countries! It is in U.S and NATOs best interest to maintain a positive relationship with Ukraine and ensure their safety. Ukraine being a country at piece can provide a lot of leverage for a since it is a Non NATO member Slavic country.\nSo from an economical, geographical and political standpoint, it makes no sense for U.S or NATO to incite nuclear war. Russia knows this and that is the main reason they keep threatening nuclear war. Because they know NATO and U.S have more to lose in case of a nuclear conflict. If there is anyone to be accused of inciting nuclear war, that would be Russia not U.S:\nRussia releases video of nuclear-capable ICBM being loaded into silo, following reports that US is preparing to send Patriot missiles to Ukraine\nRussia said its video showed a \"Yars\"intercontinental ballistic missile being loaded into a silo launcher.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/russia-shares-provocative-video-icbm-being-loaded-into-silo-launcher-2022-12\nhere is a screenshot of that article incase you can’t access the link due to state sponsored censorship:\n2. Would F-16 be a good platform for carrying nukes?\nNope!\nUnited States Nuclear Forces\nAmerican strategic delivery systems are divided into a triad, or three different modes of delivering nuclear weapons to the other side's targets. The nuclear triad consists of long-range bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). This division of delivery systems provides the foundation of deterrence by assuring that each side has a second-strike capability if attacked. In 2005, the retirement of the MX Peacekeeper ICBM was completed. Also, the Navy decommissioned the Trident I C4 missile , after 26 years of service. The navy completed the first phase of downloading the warheads from all Trident II missiles in 2005 to keep pace with 2002 Moscow Treaty or StrategicOffensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) goals.

Such short-range air-delivered nuclear weapons, operated by the US Air Force, have not been curtailed by any treaty or unilateral initiative. Land-based and sea-based tactical nukes, as they are called, have been removed by treaty mandate or unilateral initiatives. Some have been destroyed and others stockpiled. Deployed tactical nuclear weapons are now restricted to various modifications to the B-61 gravity, or free-fall, bomb. US aircraft capable of delivering this weapon are the A-4, A-6, A-7, AV-8B, F-4, F-15, F-16, F-18, F-111, and presumably the F-117 stealth fighter. NATO aircraft so capable are the F-4, F-100, F-104, and the Tornado. Source: Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and Federation of American Scientists\nhttps://www.atomicarchive.com/almanac/forces/us-forces.html\nAny other aircraft in that list is a significantly better aircraft for carrying Nuclear bombs. The Su-27s that Ukraine has are better aircraft to carry nukes than the F-16. Here is why:\nF-16 is a small and light aircraft with short legs. This means it can carry a small nuke at the cost of a lot of fuel. This greatly reduce its range, maneuverability, survivability and effectiveness. And this also means, these F-16s need to operate from airfields closer to the Russian boarder. These aircraft are too tactically important for Ukraine to put them in range of Russian attacks like that.\nF-16 is new and expensive compared to most of other aircraft in that list! Why would U.S give one of its most prized aircraft to Ukraine at the risk of having its technology compromised, when they can achieve the same exact alleged “incite nuclear war” objective with a 50 year old A-4.\nF-16 can carry the B61 nuclear bomb. This bomb developed in 1963 has a yield of 0.3–400 kiloton of TNT depending on the mod used. In comparison an ICBM has a yield of 37.4 megatons of TNT. a slightly larger aircraft can carry B83 which has 4 times the blast yield of the B61.\nTo conclude, if U.S was giving the F-16 to Ukraine to incite nuclear war, they would have provided cheaper alternatives.\n3. Where is Ukraine going to get the nuclear bombs for these jets?\nUkraine still needs to get its hands on the B61 and U.S is the only country that can provide that. If they chose to do so, it will be a publicly available information. Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar days before the Administration can take the final steps to conclude a government-to-government foreign military sale of major defense equipment valued at $14 million or more, defense articles or services valued at $50 million or more, or design and construction services valued at $200 million or more.\n4. What would be a better weapon to provide to incite nuclear war?\nSay Hello to W48 warhead for the 155mm Howitzer:\nThis is a not so well known fact! 155mm Howitzer is a nuclear capable artillery and Ukraine has plenty of these currently in service. A better way of inciting a nuclear war would be to quietly provide W48s to Ukraine. They can easily disguise these with rest of the artillery munition U.S have been providing. The other added benefit is that we don’t have to worry about Ukraine using these on anyone else other than their neighboring countries! It also has much better plausible deniability for U.S since there will be dispute on how Ukraine could have procured these munition.\nFurthermore, congress has already approved the U.S government in providing artillery shells to Ukraine, this is a rather easy way of providing nukes to Ukraine.\n5. Would Ukraine want a nuclear war?\nEven if we completely ignore the last 4 points, why would Ukraine itself ever want a nuclear war on its hands? Nuclear war is going to be devastating to all of their industries an can push the country back 50 years. Furthermore, these F-16s can tactically do so much more in pushing the tides of war in their favor by doing non nuclear sorties than if they were to just drop nukes.\nTo conclude: U.S does not gain anything from a nuclear war, F-16 is not a good plane to deliver the nuclear bomb, even if Ukraine had the jets, they can’t get the bomb, there are better ways of inciting nuclear war and Ukraine itself does not want to engage in a nuclear war! Hopefully, this answer would give you some insight on nuclear delivery and warfare. I also hope this would help you spot Russian propaganda better.",

Russia is lashing out, making threats that (fortunately) it is not able to follow up, as if the threat itself were sufficient to achieve its policy aims.

The yield for the warheads is typically in the Hiroshima-Nagasaki range and can be launched on short-intermediate range artillery missiles, or even fired from some long range artillery GUNS.\nFor that matter, just about any Jet combat aircraft can be modified to carry and drop “tactical” nuclear bombs (lower yield warheads, again, in the Hiroshima-Nagasaki range). For that matter, with some skilled engineering they could probably be carried by properly modified MiG-29s such as Ukraine is flying.\nThe only reason pukin is whining about the F-16s is because these airplanes, although fully capable of ground attack missions, excel in air-to-air combat and, flown by skilled pilots, they will be used to eliminate Russia's air superiority.",
      "13": "No Russia is just desperate for any reason to make another nuclear threat hoping to god they can scare the western public away from providing a plane they are scared of. The problem with Russia making this threat is two fold. First is the North Korea problem. If you make a million threats you never follow through with; you just end up looking and sounding ridiculous and getting isolated which is exactly what is happening to Russia. The second problem is you don’t threaten America. It will get you the kind of attention you don’t want. America is flawed for sure but Uncle Sam doesn’t f**k around, people who threaten America will get our full undivided attention and if you act on those threats you will pay an extremely disproportionate price in blood. Telling us you’re going to nuke us will just make sure we’re ready to vaporize you at a moment’s notice if you even look like you’re about to start prepping your very old nuclear weapons, and ours actually work because our maintenance budgets aren’t embezzled like they are in Russia. And in the meantime while we make sure we’re ready for any stupid moves on your end we will just keep increasing our supplies and aid to Ukraine and keep building our alliances to make sure you’re isolated, broke and weakened until your regime collapses. The nuclear threats are meaningless to us because you just keep making them like North Korea and just like North Korea becoming more and more isolated diplomatically. And don’t think Donald Trump is going to save you because that ship has sailed. We destroyed you when you were the Soviet Union and actually a near peer and powerful nation, and we will destroy you again if you keep this up. Afghanistan took only 10 years to bankrupt the USSR and Ukraine is on track to do it in 2 years.",
      "14": "original question:\n“Russia has warned the US, the F-16 might be equipped with nuclear warheads. Russia will initiate the first nuclear strike against the western nuclear threats. Is it the sign that the US has been desperate to incite nuclear war in Ukraine?”\nUkraine is one of the very few countries in the world, that have willingly and permanently given up their nukes (the others being Kazakhstan and South Africa). They have joined the NPT and have kept the regulations there in to the letter.\nSo Ukraine doesn't want any nukes.\nThe US on the other hand has a huge nuclear arsenal and much more modern carrier systems for their nukes than gravity-bombs mounted to nearly obsolete 4th generation jets. If they would want to start a nuclear war, they’d use their own B2 bombers, F-22 fighters, ICBMs, SLMBs and stealth cruise missiles.\nSo the US doesn’t want to start a nuclear war.\nAll the while the only nuke in US arsenals, that could be mounted and is integrated for F-16 is the B61. This is a nuclear free fall bomb. A bomb that could just as well be mounted on the Soviet made planes, Ukraine currently already has. Or be thrown out of a cargo plane. In fact it would probably be about the same amount of work to mount a B61 to an export F-16 (the kind Ukraine will be getting) than to a SU-27.\nSo F-16s actually doesn’t make a difference here.\nAll these three facts combined lead us to the inevitable conclusion, that this claim is absolute bogus and just more nuclear saber rattling on Russias part.",
      "15": "If Russia did indeed say that, I think it’s more a case of Putin bluffing once again, hoping to get Western leaders to cower in fear.\nRemember when Putin first launched this invasion, and he put his nuclear forces on alert? Remember when Putin said “The West is threatening to use nuclear weapons. Well, we have nuclear weapons too”? (The West wasn’t threatening to use nuclear weapons). Remember when Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons and he said “I’m not bluffing”?\nPutin is once again trying to bluff and he hopes that the West will back down in fear. About the only card left that Putin has is that he can bluff.\nPutin knows that if he uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, that that will be the end of his “special military operation.” Putin knows that if he uses nuclear weapons against any NATO member, that that will be the end of Russia.",
      "16": "Who thinks this horseshit up anyway? must be a Russian troll or propagandist. Russia invaded a peaceful country. The western allies gave said peaceful country weapons to defend itself. All Russia needed to do was NOT INVADE UKRAINE. That’s all.\nThe F-16 can be made nuclear weapon but the ones Ukraine are getting are not nuclear capable and cannot be made so. Further more ONLY the US has nuclear bombs that work with the F-16 and the US isn’t giving any of them away. To anyone-ever. Ukraine gave up all of it’s nukes to Russia for Russia’s signed treaty not to invade Ukraine. Putin broke that treaty. Nobody forced him to. Putin just get the fuck out of Ukraine.",

      "21": "There is a difference between threats and actions.\nRussia has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons. They have even taken steps to demonstrate that they have the ability to operationalize them.\nHow do we know this?\nBecause every nuclear power has a strategic command that oversees all things nuclear. They watch their own systems, oversee delivery methods, and, most importantly, they watch each other. There are steps that must be taken to operationalize nuclear weapons (taking weapons out of storage, etc.). Every power doing things with its nuclear weapons knows they are being carefully watched.\nit is thus very easy to communicate what each side intends.\nRussian jets carrying nuclear weapons violated Swedish airspace\nTwo Russian warplanes loaded with nuclear weapons violated Swedish airspace earlier in March, according to information provided to news programme TV4 Nyheter . A total of four Russian aircraft violated Swedish airspace off Gotland on 2 March, when Finland and Sweden were conducting a joint military exercise in the Baltic Sea. According to TV4, the Russian action was a deliberate act aimed at intimidating Sweden. On the day of the violation, the Swedish Armed Forces published pictures of the Russian planes, two SU 27 fighters and two SU 24 attack planes, which, according to TV4, took off from the Russian airbase at Kaliningrad. The Swedish Armed Forces did not comment because it is classified information. However, they made clear that the violation itself must have been deliberate. “We reckon it was a deliberate act. Which is very serious, especially as it is a belligerent country,” Air Force Chief Carl-Johan Edström has said. The warplanes were in Swedish airspace for about a minute. The Swedish Air Force deployed two JAS 39 Gripen aircraft, which were able to remove the intruders and take pictures of them. “This is a signal to Sweden that they have nuclear weapons, and they too can consider using them,” Stefan Ring, a military strategy expert, told TV4. If two of the four Russian warplanes were indeed armed with nuclear weapons, it gives “a completely different magnitude” to the incident, Jörgen Elving, a former lieutenant colonel, told Aftonbladet. According to Elving, these fighter jets are in most cases armed with fighter weapons, and it is not a “routine event” if Russia has a weapon system that can carry nuclear weapons and chooses to do so. “Handling nuclear weapons is not done by just anyone, it is not a routine event,” he said.\nhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/russian-jets-carrying-nuclear-weapons-violated-swedish-airspace/\nAll of this was carefully planned and displayed. The nukes were there to be seen but steered clear of NATO airspace. Going to Sweden ensured they would be seen but would not trigger any NATO response. Unfortunately, at least for Russia, it also made it clear to Sweden that they did not have a protective nuclear umbrella and likely helped push Sweden into joining NATO.\nThat is the risk of communicating by nuke.\nAt each stage of the conflict, US STRATCOM has confirmed that Russia is not taking steps to operationalize their nukes in a way that would telegraph a potential strike.\nSo the nuke talk is just talk.\nThe real issue here is the F16’s.\nUkraine already has fighter jets. Ukraine has already received Mig-29’s from former Soviet bloc states. No nuclear response. F16’s are more capable, but they are not a wonder weapon that will single-handedly win the war for Ukraine.\nWhat F16’s represent is NATO increasing pressure on Russia as Putin continues to ignore diplomatic initiatives and double down on the fight. F16’s tell Russia, “this is only going to get worse for a Russia.”\nRussia’s threat to use nukes is more pique than real intent.\nIf Russia gets serious about using nukes, STRATCOM will let is know. So will China’s, India’s, Pakistan’s, and Britain and France’s strategic commands.",
      "22": "Or, is the constant nuclear threats by Russia a clear sign that they are aware they are being out classed and out fought by the Ukraine, and have no other tool than the constant threats calling the most Ludacris thing an escalation they have no choice but to answer with nukes with.

      "24": "No. Its just the typical response from the Gremlin. “Remind the west that we (russia) have nukes” as if the west does not have nukes of its own.\nThis is not a sign that the US is desperate to incite nuclear war because there are far easier methods to do that.

      "34": "An analysis\nby Rostislav Ishchenko, former Ukrainian diplomat and a renowned Moscow-based political expert has already came to this conclusion.\nIt's worth mentioning that Zelensky violated the Budapest Memorandum before the 2022 invasion trying to make Ukraine a Nuclear state within his civil war that he promised to end in his running up campaign to presidency. The fact he was trying to obtain nuclear warfare for a domestic issue he promised to fix with ‘peace’ we should not believe he isn't capable of doing this.\nHere are important inserts from the analysis:\nDuring the NATO Summit in Vilnius, a series of consecutive actions were taken, intensifying global tensions. One particular step stands out as the most significant, potentially leading us toward a war of unparalleled magnitude: Nuclear War. This step was taken with little fanfare or notice. The NATO Summit officially endorsed the concept of an \"aircraft coalition\" with the aim of facilitating the future delivery of F-16 fighters to Ukraine.\nSome may argue that the F-16 is unquestionably a formidable aircraft but is considered outdated since it is already in service with numerous countries, including Poland. Discussions surrounding the supply of F-16s to Ukraine have been ongoing for some time. Countries such as Poland, France, Romania, and the UK have long pledged their support in training Kiev regime’s pilots and ground personnel in the operation and maintenance of these aircraft. In fact, the \"aircraft coalition\" has already been in existence for quite a while.\nThe issue lies in the intricacies. Russian foreign minister S. Lavrov deliberately drew attention to the fact that the F-16 has the capability to carry nuclear weapons, particularly in light of the decisions made at the Vilnius summit. He made it clear that ‘Russia would take this into account’.\nIt is evident that Moscow has no intention of launching a nuclear strike against either the manufacturer or the supplier of F-16s, regardless of the number deployed in Ukraine. Furthermore, the purpose is to provide Kyiv with aircraft, not atomic bombs. It is worth noting that Turkey, whose F-16s downed a Russian Su-24 in Syria on November 24, 2015, also has these aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons (with an anticipated increase of a hundred units in the near future), along with the presence of American nuclear weapons. The same situation exists in Germany, where their pilots have even undergone training to use American nuclear bombs. So, why does the prospect of the \"aircraft coalition\" in Ukraine provoke such a strong reaction in Moscow?\nFirstly, unlike Turkey and Germany, Ukraine is not a NATO member.\nSecondly, Ukraine is geographically much closer to critical Russian administrative, political, industrial, and military centres, as well as transportation hubs.\nThirdly, Ukraine is embroiled in a war with Russia, during which it has repeatedly threatened to employ quasi-nuclear weapons in the form of a \"dirty bomb.\"\nLastly, throughout the course of the conflict, Ukraine has demonstrated its willingness and readiness to launch deep strikes into Russian territory, utilising any available range, weapons, and targets, including the Moscow Kremlin and strategic aviation bases. NATO has openly and unequivocally supported and encouraged these aggressive actions by Ukraine.\nLet us assume that F-16s have indeed made their way to Ukraine.\nThese aircraft would be employed not for engaging in air-to-air combat against Russian fighter jets, as Russia enjoys an overwhelming advantage in this aspect of military capabilities. Merely being trained to operate a combat aircraft does not automatically qualify one as a skilled fighter pilot. It requires extensive flight hours on a specific model, a thorough understanding of its capabilities and limitations, and practical experience in training and real aerial battles (albeit against weaker opponents).\nThe fighters of the Kiev regime’s pilots cannot be considered adversaries in terms of aircraft quantity or pilot proficiency when compared to the Russian Air Forces. Consequently, they would primarily serve as platforms for delivering strike munitions to their targets, such as the British Storm Shadow missiles and French SCALP, which have a range of up to 400 kilometers.\nWith NATO’s backing Zelensky’s regime determined to target Russian military and civilian sites deep within their territory. The goal is to demoralise the Russian population and fuel anti-government and anti-war sentiments. Consequently, it is highly probable that if F-16s are sent to Kiev, they will attempt extensive incursions into Russian airspace. In other words, we may soon witness an aircraft from a country that has threatened Russia with nuclear weapons, even though it does not possess any, entering Russian airspace. This aircraft, supported by nuclear-armed alliance members, equipped with nuclear weapons and missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, could have far-reaching implications.\nConsidering the speed, range, and approach time of the missiles (ranging from a few minutes to half an hour depending on the target), the presence of a single launcher does not pose a significant concern. Even if it is covertly armed with a nuclear warhead and manages to bypass Russian air defence systems, the resulting damage would not be critical. Russia retains the ability to mount a retaliatory strike, including targeting decision-making centres in the West.\nHowever, it is reasonable to assume that Ukraine would launch a concentrated strike involving multiple aircraft and missiles to neutralise strategically important targets protected by missile defence systems. Transporting several nuclear warheads from European depots to Ukrainian territory is not a challenge since a military aircraft can deliver the cargo discreetly, with only the recipient being aware of its contents. Thus, with Ukraine now possessing F-16s, Russia must be prepared for the possibility of a large-scale nuclear bombardment at any moment.\nIn the face of such threats, it is vital to have an appropriate response plan, particularly when nuclear weapons are involved.\nOnce again, it is important to note that Russian foreign minister's warning to the West was as restrained as possible given the current circumstances. There is no immediate intention to launch a nuclear strike against the West following the deployment of F-16s in Ukraine, assuming it actually occurs. Nor does Russia seek any form of armed confrontation with the West. The objective is to secure a victory in Ukraine without escalating the conflict to Europe.\nNevertheless, in times of war, various contingencies and unforeseen events can arise. While launches of intercontinental or submarine-launched missiles can be tracked, foreign naval vessels capable of carrying nuclear weapons can approach Russian shores undetected at close range. The take-off of each fighter jet cannot be monitored, and detection may only occur once they are already in Russian airspace. Hence, Russia must be prepared for such scenarios, including the possibility of aircraft carrying nuclear weapons.\nConsequently, the protocol for responding to a nuclear threat needs to be revised to reduce decision-making time. Furthermore, a similar threat to the United States' territory must be established since we cannot deploy a sufficient number of nuclear-capable aircraft near them. However, the response will not be symmetrical.\nImplementing these measures will lower the threshold for both sides to make decisions regarding a nuclear strike. Lavrov has duly warned our adversaries about this.\nUltimately, the planes have yet to be delivered, and even if Ukraine manages to receive them without being eliminated first, they will not be able to change the situation on the battlefield. Wouldn't it be wiser for the West to abandon this futile and perilous endeavour before its dire consequences materialise?\nSource: \"Самолётная коалиция\" приблизила ядерную войну",
      "35": "Unless Putin has totally lost his mind, he has to realize that initiating a nuclear strike against any NATO nation is, at best, suicide. The absolute best he can hope for is the destruction of NATO and the United States, but at the cost of the utter oblivion of Russia. Russia has ABSOLUTELY no hope of “winning” a nuclear war against the west. None. And if his nuclear arsenal is in a similar state to his conventional forces, he might still inflict some damage on the west, but will still end up pretty much watching Russia cease to exist as a nation.\nHe could, possibly, attack Ukraine. But this will not likely go his way either. Those few nations that are neutral will likely turn against him, and most of those nations supporting him are likely to turn against him or, at least, withdraw any support. China will not accept this, and likely join the west in further ostracizing Russia, cutting them off from the world even further.\nAnd that’s assuming that NATO didn’t decide at that point to get involved in Ukraine, which then becomes possible. If Putin is already ready to nuke one country, it might become prudent to take action against him before he goes any further.\nBut as out of touch with reality as Putin is, I highly doubt he’s so far out of touch as to think the US, UK, and French nuclear arsenals are not capable of reducing Russia to a glowing slag heap.\nIn the long run, this is almost assuredly bluster and nuclear saber rattling.",
      "36": "The answer is NO! Escalate the Russo-Ukrainian War into nuclear is what everyone trying to avoid. Just search for Mutually Assured Destruction (alias: MAD) and you will understand why.\nEven if you are a firm believer of ukrainian propaganda (which is discredit itself by its two different narrative) you could ask yourself: Putin and co. really want conquer a nuclear desert?\nBut this question has some false suggestions.\nLike F-16-s are a threat to Russia, in great many proxy wars F-16-s and different Russian planes clashed in the skies, and it was never interpreted as a direct nuclear threat to Russia, why would this time be different? Especially as Russia is already used many nuclear capable weapons like Iskander or Kinzhal missiles, without nukes, and the west doesn’t reacted it was a nuclear threat.\nRussian laws currently only let its military use nuclear weapons: if Russias mere existence is threatened by nuclear or conventional forces. Ukrainian army are currently trying recapture the ruins called Bakhmut, and slowly advancing toward the Azov-sea, and even if their succeed they would still stand in pre-war ukrainian territory. So where would be the existential threat to Russia? Some dozens of F-16 won’t change this war so much, that suddenly ukrainian armies could march on Moscow.\nNeither US is desperate. If they would be, they would force Zelensky into negotiations. As a negotiated peace would be better from US viewpoint than the total collapse of Ukraine. But this war in absolute numbers is very cheap to US government, they only sent in “junk” weapons waiting for disassembly and destruction, or exhibition weapons, but for the later future selling will make it profitable even. Did you ever think about how many HIMARS or Switchblades US will sell in the near future?\nThe sad truth is Russia is maintaining this level of conflict because they believe the collective west will lose the political will to support Ukraine, and after that they could conquer it wholesale. And the west believe Russia will lose too much man and equipment in long term and Ukraine could regain its original borders.\nThis war will be long, but not nuclear unless something drastically change. Like ukrainians develop their own nuke (anyone has NPP theoretically capable building nukes) and use it on Russia. But they won’t do it, as if there is a way to lose western support that would be it.",

      "40": "“Desperate”? Not at all, it’s just optional. After all, it doesn’t matter to anyone (except Ukraine) if the USA nominally “loses” the war in Ukraine: the standard business model will just get shifted to somewhere else. The show must go on.\nFortunately, JFK abandoned the USA’s former commitment to first strike; and also generally reinforced the existing US doctrine of minimizing nuclear proliferation (his temporary MacMillan faux pas being rapidly mitigated).\nUnfortunately, President Biden has resurrected the former; though at least he hasn’t disturbed the latter.\nOf course, that doesn’t mean he’ll start such a nuclear war! The problem here is two-fold: (a) he may take the legalistic view that if Ukraine starts one, his own hands are washed clean; and (b) his reluctance to arm Ukraine with nuclear weapons may turn out to be as limited as all the other US red lines he’s breached or allowed Ukraine to breach, even including the ones that he himself drew. As in the past he’s always gotten away with it, why not cross just one more red line?\nJust as for MacArthur when China was embarrassing him, the temptation must be very strong to do another MacMillan. The trouble is, Biden can’t control the manned F-16 platforms the way he (theoretically, with a reverse dead man’s switch) can control the Trident platforms. Worse: unlike MacArthur, he can’t be sacked for such deviation from US doctrine.",

      "1": "Generally speaking, yes. It does depend on where you are charging, at what rate, etc., versus the local price of gas.\nIn the extreme, if I charge our 2022 Tesla Model Y long-range at home, $15 would be sufficient to pay for TWO full charges, which would get me at least 500 miles, probably more if I weren’t such a lead foot.\nIn my Chrysler 300C, I might get a little over 100 miles on $15.",
      "2": "Here in New Zealand I pay around 90% less per mile for electricity than I used to pay for gasoline.\nSo, for me, I can travel the same distance on $1.45 of electricity as I can on $15 of gasoline. This does fluctuate a little, depending on what gasoline costs on any given day.",
      "3": "$15 of gas is about 4 gallons. If your car gets 40 MPG that 160 miles. I charge my EV and the cash value is about $25 for a full charge (or actually 90%) 90% for my vehicle is about 260 miles. BUT if I charged at home, on my home charger to get to 90% would be about $60 for about 1100 miles (multiple charges)\nReal numbers. In order for it to be cheaper for a gas vehicle you’d have to have a car that gets nearly 100 MPG. Not sure there are any of those on the market, other than hybrids.",
      "4": "$15 of gasoline is about 3 gallons where I live. That gets you about 90 miles. $15 of electricity ( at home. $.07/kWh) gets you a bit more than 200 kwhs. In a Tesla 3, that will take you about 800 miles.",
      "5": "Pretty easy to calculate.

      "6": "That answer is changing fast. Right now you can go about half as far on $15 worth of gas as you could a few years ago. Rapidly dropping to perhaps a third as far. And the cost of the electricity is pretty stable I think. I admit I have not been watching it with bated breath, but I do not have an electric car yet either. Note that you just defined the criteria as “go further”. We have seen some folk play with engines and such so they can get 100 miles to the gallon or better, on dead flat, with no wind, super gentle acceleration, and a very light car frame, tires stiff as heck. If that is what test you want, then I think electric wins hands down, and did even 20 years ago. The electrics have improved a lot so things like accelerating onto the freeway, driving up into the mountain passes, etc., are more acceptable to our using them. If you are giving your free cash to the oil industry, I suggest you consider the electric car as an “in your face” to these pirates.",

However, in the case of the Performance version, the efficiency drops quite noticeably to 113 MPGe: 298 Wh/mi (185 Wh/km).Mar 28, 2023\nWe’ll use 298 Wh/mi\nSo for the EV,\n$15 x 1000 Wh/$0.11 x 1 mi/298 Wh = 457 miles.\nDon’t forget, this is a smaller 5-pax vehicles with less room and payload no road taxes, and I suspect the usage does not include the charger inefficiency of around 15%\nStill, The EV is a winner by a fair margin.",
      "8": "Depends a lot on where you buy your energy from.\nIn Texas, a gallon is $3.23 or so (today, probably be different some other day), so you get about 4.67gallons for $15.\nElectricity for residential use is about $0.14 per kWh. So you get ~107 kWh for $15.\nNext, which car is it? A Prius gets about 56 miles per gallon, so 263 miles. A 2019 Dodge RAM 1500 is more like 25, so 117 miles.\nA Tesla Model 3 gets 5 mile per kWh, so 535 miles on a $15 fill-up. The Tesla Cybertruck, like the RAM gets 2.4 mile per kWh, which is about 256 miles per $15.\nIt is more difficult to get a good price for a Tesla Supercharger station. Around $0.30 per kWh seems to be the number that comes up, but although I saw something saying “Tesla now let you know queue time and price for their supercharger stations”, I can’t seem to find that. Either way:\n$0.30 per kWh means you get 50 kWh, so a little under half those tnumbers - now the Tesla model 3 and Prius are about equal, 250 miles for the Tesla. The cybertruck also about same as the RAM, with 120 miles.\nSo, if you can charge at home at least some of the time, EV gets you “more miles per dollar”. If you can’t, it may be about same.\nNow, you may live in California, or the UK, or somewhere else, and you’d get some different numbers - for both electricity and gasoline. I’m not going to go through 50 states and 190 countries to list every possible combination.",
      "9": "The answer depends on if you use a supercharger or charge at home. You can fully charge a tesla about three times in most parts of the united states on $15 of electric. I used that car as an example because it has the largest battery capacity.\nAlternately that will get you about five gallons of gas on a good day and even estimating 30mpg, that’s only 150 miles.

    "title": "How do I store large amounts of rice",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Storing large amounts of rice requires careful consideration of factors such as moisture, pests, and temperature. Here are guidelines to help you store a significant quantity of rice properly:\n1. **Choose the Right Container:**\n- Use airtight containers or food-grade storage bins with tight-fitting lids. This helps prevent moisture and pests from getting into the rice.\n2. **Keep It Dry:**\n- Moisture is the enemy of rice storage. Ensure that the rice is completely dry before storing it. If moisture is present, it can lead to the growth of mold and spoilage.\n3. **Use Mylar Bags or Vacuum-Sealed Bags:**\n- Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers or vacuum-sealed bags can help create a low-oxygen environment, extending the shelf life of rice. This is particularly useful for long-term storage.\n4. **Store in a Cool, Dark Place:**\n- Keep rice in a cool and dark place to prevent exposure to heat and sunlight, which can affect the quality of the rice. A pantry or a cool storage room is ideal.\n5. **Protect from Pests:**\n- To protect against insects and pests, consider placing bay leaves, whole cloves, or dried chili peppers in the storage containers. These can act as natural repellents.\n6. **Avoid Temperature Fluctuations:**\n- Temperature fluctuations can impact the quality of stored rice. Try to keep the storage area at a relatively consistent temperature.\n7. **Check for Infestations:**\n- Periodically check the stored rice for any signs of pests or infestations. If you notice any issues, address them promptly.\n8. **Rotate Stock:**\n- If you're storing a large amount of rice for an extended period, practice FIFO (First In, First Out) by rotating your stock. Use the oldest rice first and replenish your storage with fresh rice.\n9. **Consider Freezing:**\n- If you have the freezer space, you can freeze rice to kill any potential pests. Place the rice in airtight containers or sealed bags before freezing.\n10. **Label and Date:**\n- Clearly label each container with the type of rice and the date it was stored. This helps you keep track of the rice's freshness.\n11. **Store Away from Strong Odors:**\n- Rice can absorb odors, so store it away from strong-smelling items like spices or cleaning products.\nBy following these guidelines, you can store large amounts of rice efficiently, maintaining its quality for an extended period. Always check the storage conditions recommended for the specific type of rice you have, as different varieties may have slightly different storage requirements.",
      "2": "Add red pepper with rice. The insect repellent effect of red pepper protects rice.\nIn Japan, special products filled with chili peppers are sold.",
      "3": "Method 1 of 5:Putting Rice in an Airtight Container\n1. Place an opened bag of white rice into a plastic zipper bag.\nIf you’ve already opened the bag of rice and plan to use the rice often, simply put it into a larger zipper bag for easy access. Seal it up most of the way and then push out as much air as you can before sealing it completely. Toss it in the pantry for up to 2 years or in the refrigerator for up to 10 years.\nEven though rice lasts a long time, it’s best to use it sooner rather than later.\nThis will work for brown rice as well, but it will only stay fresh or 6 months in the pantry and 1 year in the refrigerator or freezer.\nIf you often wash and reuse plastic storage bags, make sure the bag is completely dry before putting the rice in—any moisture can cause mold to grow on the granules.\n2. Pour uncooked rice into airtight plastic bins for easy access.\nChoose sturdy plastic bins with well-fitting lids to ensure the rice is exposed to the least amount of air as possible. Make sure the bins are washed and dried beforehand and don’t have any holes or cracks that pests can sneak into. This is a great option if you cook rice often since you can scoop out what you need and reseal the container with ease.\nYou can buy food-grade storage bins online or from any superstore with a cookware section.\nStored this way, brown rice will last 6 months and while rice will last up to 10 years. However, you should always check it for signs of spoilage (discoloration, odd smell, weevils) before cooking it.\nPests can be the biggest menace when storing large amounts of dried goods like rice, so take the time to thoroughly examine the container for holes or cracks before pouring your rice into it.\n3. Vacuum-seal white rice in food-grade bags for long-term storage.\nPour the rice into food-safe vacuum bags and use a vacuum sealer to suck all the air out of the bag and seal it up. If you plan to use small portions of the rice sooner rather than later, you may want to put the bulk of it into a large food-grade vacuum bag and dole out single or double portions into smaller bags. The rice will stay fresh for 10 years or longer if you store it in a cool, dry place.\nThis is a great option if you’re looking to save space in your pantry—you can pile multiple vacuum-packed bags into a large basket or bin to keep them organized.\nToss the vacuum-packed bag of rice into the freezer to make it last 30 years or more.\nThis isn’t a good option to store brown rice because the natural oils will cause it to spoil.\n4. Pour white rice into mylar bags with oxygen absorbers for long-term storage.\nTransfer the rice from its original packaging into mylar bags, toss in 1 to 3 oxygen absorbers (depending on the size of the bag) and then seal them shut using a hot iron. Store the individual mylar bags in a large food-grade bin with a lid.\nFor smaller bags that only hold 3 to 5 cups of rice, use 1 (100cc) oxygen absorber. Larger bags require 3 to 5 oxygen absorbers (300cc to 500cc) to work properly over a long period of time.\nThis is a good option if you’re planning to store rice for 30 years or more.\nDon’t put brown rice into mylar bags—the oils will seep out of the granules and cause the rice to spoil.\nMethod 2 of 5:Storing Rice at Room Temperature\n1. Put airtight bags and containers in a cool, dry area with good ventilation.\nPlace the airtight bags or containers of rice in a pantry or cupboard—anywhere away from heat or light is a good spot. Make sure the room is air-conditioned or at least has a fan to ensure good air flow.\nStale or stagnant air could increase the humidity in the room and can cause the rice to go bad faster.\nUse a dehumidifier if you live in a hot, humid area—especially if you’re storing the rice in a garage or separate storage facility outside of your home.\nCheck the room for any signs of condensation, leakage, or moisture.\n2. Make sure the temperature is between 50°F (10°C) and 70°F (21°C).\nIf you’re storing the rice inside your home and you have air conditioning or live in a cool environment, the temperature should be just fine. If you’re putting the rice in a garage or other storage facility, install a thermometer so you can make sure the temperature is appropriate and stable.\nIf you’re storing the rice in your garage, make sure it’s away from any sources of heat like laundry machines, heating units, or generators.\n3. Place the containers or bags of rice on a shelf rather than the ground.\nStore the rice anywhere off of the ground to make it harder for pests to access it. Storing things vertically is also a big space-saver and will allow more airflow around the room.\nIt’s especially important to store the containers off of the ground if you live in an area that’s prone to flooding.\n4. Examine the storage area and the containers every 2 to 4 weeks.\nEvery so often, inspect the storage area for any signs of moisture or heat. Feel the lids to make sure they’re stuck on tight (but don’t open them).\nIf the container or bag is damaged in any way or if the lid has come loose, inspect and smell the food for signs of spoilage. If it's still good, put it in a new container.\nIf you notice condensation on the containers or anywhere in the room, check to make sure the rice is still good and, if so, transfer it into a new container and store it in a different area.\nMethod 3 of 5:Freezing and Refrigerating White and Brown Rice\n1. Keep your refrigerator clean and set between 32°F (0°C) and 40°F (4°C).\nIf your refrigerator has a built-in thermometer, check it every day to make sure it falls within the proper range. If your fridge doesn’t have a thermometer, put a separate one inside so you can keep track of the temperature.\nYou should also check the lining on the perimeter of the door to make sure there’s a tight seal.\nThrow out any spoiled foods that might cause bacteria and moisture to get trapped inside the unit.\n2. Make sure your freezer is organized and set to 0°F (-18°C).\nCheck the temperature reading every day to make sure each unit is at the ideal temperature. If your freezer doesn’t have a built-in thermometer, put one between 2 bags of frozen goods and check it every day or as often as you can.\nDon’t overpack the shelves; pack them evenly so there’s good airflow inside the unit.\nIf you notice any frost or signs of a leakage (inside or out), it may be time to call a professional or get a replacement.\n3. Place the rice bag or container on a shelf, not in the door or in a drawer.\nPut the rice toward the back of a shelf for long-term storage so you don’t have to move it to get to things you might use more frequently. The center or bottom shelves of the freezer or refrigerator are usually the best spots because they’re colder.\nThe door of your refrigerator or freezer is the warmest spot and experiences more temperature shifts, so don’t put the rice there.\nDon’t store the rice in crisper drawers because they retain some amount of moisture that can cause the rice to spoil faster.\nMethod 4 of 5:Preserving White Rice in Pickling Jars\n1. Wash all of the pickling jars and lids with dish soap and water.\nUse regular dish soap and a sponge to thoroughly clean the insides of each jar and lid. How many jars you’ll need depends on how much rice you’re planning to store.\nFor instance, 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of rice can fit into 6 ⁄2 US gal (1.9 L) jars.\n2. Steam the jars in a bath of water and vinegar for 10 minutes.\nPour ⁄4 cup (59 mL) of water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar into a large stewpot and bring it to a boil. Place each jar upside-down into the water so the steam fills the insides.\nThe water-vinegar steam will sterilize the jars.\n3. Dry the jars upside down in the oven at 225°F (107°C) for 20 minutes.\nUse jar-lifting tongs to lift each jar out of the pot, allowing excess moisture to drain out. Use a clean cloth to support the body of the jar as you transfer it to the lowest rack of your oven. Don't touch the jars with your hands—they're hot!\nLet the jars cool down in the oven after the 20-minute drying session.\n4. Place the jar’s lid caps in the oven for 10 minutes.\nSeparate the saucer-shaped lids from the circular ring and put them onto a clean, oven-safe container (like a baking tray). Slide them into the oven set to 225°F (107°C) for 10 minutes.\nThe heat will help sterilize the lids.\n5. Use a funnel to fill each jar, leaving ⁄4 in (1.9 cm) of headspace.\nOnce the jars are clean and dry (they'll still be quite hot!), turn them upright onto a workspace and use a funnel to fill up each one with rice. Be sure to leave about ⁄4 in (1.9 cm) of space from the top of the rice to the lip of the jar.\nIt may help to slightly shake the jars to even out the rice so you can pack more in.\n6. Put the filled, unlidded jars into the oven for 90 minutes to 1 hour 50 minutes.\nLeave the jars unlidded and place them on the lowest rack of your oven. Keep it set at 225°F (107°C). For half-gallon (1.9 L) jars, leave them in the oven for 1 hour 50 minutes. If you're using quart-sized jars, only heat them for 90 minutes.\nThis extra heat will kill off any pests or eggs that might be in the rice.\n7. Transfer the jars to your workstation and screw the lids on.\nUse an oven mitt to transfer the jars out of the oven and onto your workspace. Place the sterilized mid-section of the lids over the mouth of each jar and then screw each lid on as tightly as you can.\nThe jars will be hot so don’t try to use your bare hands to screw on the lids!\n8. Press the top of the lids to make sure they're airtight.\nUse your finger to push down on each lid to see if it stays in place. If it springs up, the lid isn't fully sealed and you’ll need to use a vacuum sealer.\nYou can also check by looking at the lid from eye-level. If you see a slight, concave indentation, the lid is good to go! If it's flat or bulging, it's not air-sealed.\n9. Use a vacuum sealer to seal any loose lids, if necessary.\nRemove the outer ring of the jar’s lid and leave the small circular disc in place. Place the vacuum sealer attachment (the \"wide-mouth\" size) over the top of the jar and plug the hose into the sealing cap. Press the activator button to suck the air out of the jar. The vacuum sealer will automatically stop when it's done or you’ll see a green light show up on the console.\nOnce the green light shows up or the vacuum sealer stops, remove the vacuum-sealer attachment and screw on the outer ring of the jar.\nMethod 5 of 5:Storing White Rice in Mylar Bags\n1. Freeze the rice 1 week before storing it, if possible.\nPlace your bulk rice in the deep freezer (if you have one) to get rid of any pests or eggs hidden in the rice. It's not likely to happen, but pests have been known to get into large bulk bags at grocery stores and in warehouses.\nIf you have a sub-zero temperature deep-freezer, put the rice in there for at least 24 hours and up to 1 week to kill off pests and eggs.\nIf you don't have room in your freezer for bulk rice, divide it into smaller freezer bags.\n2. Pour the rice into individual mylar bags.\nUse scissors to cut open the bulk bag of rice at 1 corner and carefully pour it into the mylar bag. Place one hand at the top of the bag to angle your pouring and use your other hand to support the rest of the bag. Stop pouring when the rice is about 6 inches (15 cm) down from the top of the mylar bag.\nIt may help to have a friend hold the mylar bag or to set it upright inside of a bucket while you pour the rice in.\nIf you plan to use some of the rice in the near future, use smaller mylar bags to hold single or double servings of rice.\nMylar bags come in sizes ranging from 4 in (10 cm) by 6 in (15 cm) to 20 in (51 cm) by 30 in (76 cm).\nYou can easily store 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of rice in 3 large 1-gal (3.7-litre) mylar bags.\n3. Put at least 1 oxygen absorber in each bag.\nThe strength of oxygen absorbers is measured in \"cc,\" which corresponds to how much oxygen each pack can remove. For each gallon (3.7 L) of 6.7 pounds (3.0 kg) of rice in the bag, use 300- to 500-cc worth of oxygen absorbers.\nYou can buy a pack of 100 individual 100-cc oxygen absorbers to use for smaller mylar bags. You can also put several packets into each larger bag to meet the cc-requirement.\nYou'll still feel air inside the bag—that's the nitrogen that the oxygen absorbers can't remove.\n4. Set an iron to high heat with no steam and wait for it to heat up.\nPlug in your iron near an ironing board or any other flat, heat-resistant surface. If your iron has degree settings, set it to 350°F (176°C). If you're using an auto-steam iron, empty out all of the water before heating it up and using it on the bag.\nIf you're using an ironing board, you may want to change the cover or lay down a sheet you don't care about because some of the plastic on the inside of the mylar bag can seep out when you seal it up.\nAs an alternative, use a flat-iron made for straightening hair.\n5. Push excess air out of the bag and iron along the edge to seal it.\nTurn the bag on its side and press down to expel as much air as you can. Use the long edge of the iron to go over the edge of the bag, covering a strip ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.\nYou should only need to go over the edge once. However, if you see any bubbles in the bag near the freshly-sealed edge or the corners, go over it again.\nRepeat this for all the filled bags.\n6. Store the sealed mylar bags in a food-grade bucket with a lid.\nLook for \"food-grade\" or \"food-safe\" somewhere on the bucket’s label or on the bottom near the recycling icons. Place all the sealed bags of rice into the bucket either upright or on their sides. Once they’re packed in, put the lid on the bucket.\nYou can buy food-grade buckets or bins online or at most home hardware stores.\n7. Place the bucket in a cool, dry place that's consistently around 70°F (21°C).\nA large pantry or a temperature-controlled garage is the perfect place to store your packed rice. With proper storage and the right number of oxygen absorbers, the rice will stay fresh for up to 40 years!\nIt's okay if the temperature inside the storage room wavers in small degrees—just make sure there are no large drops or spikes.",
