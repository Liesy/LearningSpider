      "1": "Not everyone gets their news from Russian state propaganda sources.",
      "2": "The more relevant question would be why in God’s name does Russia not admit they have lost the war? The question as to whether Russia could win the war with Ukraine borders on the ludicrous. It has already lost almost every aspect of its stated aims. To wit;\n\nPutin wanted to decapitate Ukraine and install a puppet government. Instead the VDV – his best troops were decimated at Hostumel and then they left a 40 Km convoy to be shelled into oblivion by Ukrainian Special Forces and artillery to the point they had to retreat and try to cobble together a fighting force out of the survivors. But that was only his first failure\n\nThey wanted to “demilitarize” Ukraine; Ukraine is now armed to the teeth with far better weapons than Russia has, even though most of these weapons were weapons already scheduled for destruction or replacement in NATO holdings. As well, ever more and more modern weapons are being given to Ukraine after each atrocity. In the interim, having lost tens of thousands of men, Russia is now forced to trot out T-54 and T-55 tanks built in the 1940’s – it would be hard to imagine a more massive failure;\n\nThey wanted to shorten their borders with NATO; With Finland now joining NATO because of Russia’s actions, they have now doubled the length of those borders. With Sweden now joining NATO he has essentially made the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake, isolated Kaliningrad limiting Russia sea traffic to St Petersburg to a very narrow lane in it. A complete and utter failure on that point.\n\nThe wanted to divide NATO; NATO is now more conjoined than it has been since the end of the Cold War and every country in it is now re-arming because Russia has proven itself and imperialistic threat; Complete failure there.\nHe thought he could weaponize food by stealing grain out of Ukrainian silo’s and selling it while capturing southern Ukraine and isolating it economically from their sea ports. His attempt to do so failed, Snake Island was recaptured by Ukraine and Turkey is now going to escort Ukrainian cargo ships carrying grain to ensure Putin can’t starve millions. Rather embarrassing failure there.\n\nThey wanted to “denazify” Ukraine (which is led by a Jewish President) – instead, the Wagner Group (with its name chosen because Wagner was Hitler’s favourite composer) now is front page news and has pictures of its founder, Dimitri Utkin all over the internet with his swastika, a Nazi eagle and SS lightning bolts tattoos covering his body – illustrating very clearly which country that needed to be “denazified.”; Utter failure.\n\nPutin wanted to show off the strength of the Russia military – “the second strongest in the world.” Now, everyone realizes that it is merely the second strongest in Ukraine. It has become an such an international joke that China, Kazakhstan and Georgia are all making noises about reclaiming their territory. And you can look to Georgia if you want to see the next NATO member. Again, hard to imagine a bigger failure than that.\n\nPutin wanted to rebuild the old Russian empire; Instead Russia, already suffering from a catastrophic demographic has instead lost tens of thousands of men, suffered sanctions that are wiping out the economy (The ruble is now worth less than a penney, 35% of Russian businesses are saying they can’t find sufficient people to run their businesses and the Russian stock market flat out refuses to let foreign investor pull their money) and is being degraded economically, militarily and demographically by the day. Absolute failure there.\n\nPutin now has an arrest warrant issued by the ICC – ensuring not only that his credibility in the civilized world is now zero (even China is no longer supporting them in the UN with them and India voting against Russia in the UN in the most recent resolution in which the vote was 122 to 5) illustrating that Russia in now an international pariah and Putin is restricted in his travel unless he wants to be arrested; So that too is a spectacular failure.\n\nThe truth is that Putin’s vanity project and his lackey’ are destroying Russia more and more every day and even if Ukraine walked off the battlefield tomorrow and left everything else to Russia, as seen above, Russia has lost – badly. Their posturing has turned out to be the invisible clothing of a naked emperor and a Potemkin army saturated with corruption. Worse, the gangster state has been exposed as a regime that practices war crimes and crimes against humanity as standard operating practice and is rightfully despised by anyone with a set of morals worthy of the name. And still some of his followers keep digging that pit...",
      "3": "Some of the reasons we believe Ukraine is likely to “win” the war:\nThe Russians haven’t managed to make any progress worth mentioning for over a year now. Yes, the Wagner group did manage to capture one mid sized town but the Wagner group isn’t around anymore and the Russians don’t have any other mercenary groups of the same caliber. The Ukranian have liberated huge parts of the occupied terrain since then. Their progress is slow at the moment but they are still progressing.\nRussia is spending their resources faster than they can replenish them. They still have large stockpiles of weapons and ammunition from the old Soviet Union but it’s all old stuff and it won’t last forever. Ukraine is receiving a steady supply of new modern material from the west; not nearly as much as we wish but still enough they have slowly but surely been gaining material strength and they’re not going to run out anytime soon.\nRussia has more than three times the population as Ukraine has so in theory they should be able to field far more troops. But they can’t send their whole army to Ukraine since they are involved in several other conflicts too and also have to maintain forces along the borders to other nations and across their vast territory. Ukraine only need to focus on one war. Russia also has a tendency to rush in fresh troops before they are properly trained and their strategy is rather wasteful on human resources. All in all, even though the Russian troops may sometimes outnumber the Ukrainians a little bit, there’s no realistic chance it will ever be big enough to compensate for all the other disadvatages Russia has.\nRussia is struggling with logistics and have serious problems getting their troops and materiel to where it is needed at the front.\nRussia wastes resources attacking civilians. Ignoring for the sake of argument that this is a war crime, every missile or drone they use to kill civilians is one they can’t use to kill Ukrainian soldiers.\nRussia is struggling with internal conflicts. There’s a lot of infighting among the leadership and also a small but surprisingly effective resistance among the population. Ukraine has no such problems.\nUkraine has better intel.\nUkraine has far better and more flexible strategies and tactics and is far better at taking advantage of opportunities that turn up on the battlefield. Russia is slow to react and far more predictable.",
      "4": "It’s not the west, it’s every country in the world saying this (except for Russia/China/NK/Iran, lol).\nLook at Russia’s losses below (this is visually confirmed by Oryx).\nAnd below is Ukraine’s losses (also virtually confirmed by Oryx).\nRussia hasn’t gained anything, it is only temporarily occupying some lands. Russia/China pleased to Ukraine to end the war by agreeing to a ceasefire (and that Russia could keep the lands it occupied), of course Ukraine didn’t agree because that’s absurd.\nBut it points out that Russia is desperate, it wants the war to end, because it knows that sooner or later in this war it can’t even hold these lands and will be pushed out of them (and thus it will have literally nothing as a result of this war it waged).\nAnd on top of that, Russia has lost 2.8x more equipment than Ukraine. It’s very obvious Russia is losing this war, Russia is literally living right now on borrowed time in this war (borrowed time that Russia borrowed by being economically supported by China during the sanctions).\nThis is how Russia has been surviving, it heavily discounted the unit price of oil/gas/coal and both China and India have been buying those at record levels. This prevent Russia from just economically collapsing into a great depression basically (but it’s also not good for Russia in the long term, it means Russia is massively shipping out hoards of its raw materials that in reality are worth way more than they are getting for them, it means Russia is losing big time here economically in the big picture).\nRussia is losing the war, and it is going to lose the war. There is nothing Russia can do to win this war, and the longest it keeps trying to wage it, the more equipment it is going to lose, and the more mass raw materials it is going to lose from exporting them to China/India at a heavily discounted price in its attempt to maintain export revenue etc.",
      "5": "Because when one of the most effective Russian combat units turns and goes to Moscow, realizing that they will not win this war, it is hard to imagine that Russia is able to win this war. All that Putin is trying to do now is play for time at the cost of thousands of killed mobilized Russians who are sent to certain death. I do not think that when Putin decided to attack Kyiv, he planned that Ukraine would destroy his beloved Crimean bridge, and also that Ukraine would strike at Moscow.",
      "6": "Why do Русские Пропагандисты, paid (in what? near-worthless rubles?) employees of the Russian Disinformation (“Internet Research”) Service, refer to the non-Russian world as “the West”, as though it were a monolith?\nAnd try to gaslight us that Russia isn't losing?\nИди нахуйете самo с кактусом or, if such be the case: Иди напиздате самa.\nAnd, in either case, Блядольф Путлер as well",
      "7": "131K RuSSian casualties {including thousands of radiation poisoning from the Chernobyl offensive} -355 rotary aircraft - 212 fix wing aircraft - 5 warships hundreds of armored vehicles destroyed - Russian orcs retreating (not yet routed)\nPutin is holding on to power - for now.\nUkraine is getting more arms and intel.\nKyiv hasn’t won yet but Russia has already lost.",
      "8": "Mainly because of all the invincible Russian tanks they’ve blown up and unstoppable missiles they’ve shot down.\nUps and downs, you know?",
      "9": "possibly because russia is losing it. the russians are losing ground, men and irreplaceable materiel; putin is firing and “disappearing” his generals and the russian economy is tanking. pretty clear signs the war is not going well for them. big mistake by putin.",
      "10": "What makes you think it isn’t?\nRussia continues to move more and more of its troops from around Russia to Ukraine. Won’t risk it’s aircraft to the withering missiles, etc., of Ukraine.\nThe west unending supply of munitions and weapon systems, easily replacing anything lost.\nF-16s are about to be manned by Ukrainians trained well.\nThe bridge from Crimea to Russia nonstop traffic leaving Crimea. Whatever for.\n\nWhat could Russia possibly have to fear. They know Ukraine will cease attacking in Russian soil when Ukraine has recovered all of Ukrainian territory to include Crimea.",
      "11": "Because a year and a half into a 3 day military operation to destroy Ukraines ability to function as a free state, Ukraine is still functioning as a free state. And what’s more it occupies more of its own territory than it did last year.\nCan you think of any metric by which they are not winning? Especially as their opp...",
      "12": "Cause Ukraine is winning😂😂😂😂😂😂",
      "13": "The west know the truth that Ukraine won’t win the war but they can use it to weaken Russia.\n🚨\"How long will Ukraine last?\", Julian Ropcke writes in the German BILD paper.\nIn the battles for Staromayorskoye, Ukraine lost 31 armoured vehicles, including 23 APCs from NATO countries.\nBild believes that, despite the loss of the village, this outcome of the battle is a success for Russia.\n“Moscow's strategy is to destroy as many (Western) armored vehicles of the advancing Ukrainian forces as possible. Russia knows that Ukraine has much more problems than the Russian Federation with the replacement and repair of equipment.”\nAccording to Bild, since the start of the counteroffensive, the Ukrainian army has lost nine out of 18 high-tech Leopard 2A6 tanks delivered from Germany.\n“While many of the damaged tanks are repairable, this is proving difficult as the repair sites are about 1,000 kilometers to the west, and some damaged German tanks are stuck under enemy fire in the Zaporozhye region”\nBild reminds that, despite the promise of about 100 modern Western main battle tanks (Leopard 2, Challenger and Abrams) in January 2023, neither Germany, nor the UK, nor the United States have yet fulfilled the delivery.\n“On the ...",
      "14": "Why does the West still stick to the idea that Ukraine is winning this war?\nBecause we can read maps. Russia is being slowly but surely pushed back out of the territory they had conquered. Russia’s very ability to make war at all is being depleted at an alarming (or gratifying, depending on your point of view) rate. Russia is losing.",
      "15": "The fact that a country with a population of 36.7 million people has held out in a war with a country of 144.4 million for over 500 days is a win right there. One would assume Russia could create 36.7 million soldiers with each one having a mandate to kill one Ukrainian. Since they haven’t done so, we have to wonder what make YOU think Russia is winning?",
      "16": "Um, because it is. Never mind the Ukrainian offensive, what happened to the Russian offensive which never materialised?",
      "17": "Because it is a result of ignorance multiplied by arrogance and nurtured by extensive brainwashing through the Western media, coupled with denial of truth.\nMore intelligent ones might have been in a state of denial, not able to breach the psychological wall. While the uneducated ignorants could believe it for real, because their illiteracy prevents them from seeing through even obvious lies and discrepancies.\nJust imagine how unintelligent someone should be to believe, for example, that sending some sort of a weapon of lower quality than Russia has (for example, same Leopards II or Abrams) in significantly lower quantities could be called a “game changer”. It’s really a facepalming moment.",
      "18": "Because if Russia would win the NATO, and especially Europe, would be lost, and the balance of power would make America small again.",
      "19": "Probably the overwhelming evidence of Russia’s battlefield disasters, and impending geostrategic dissolution.",
      "20": "Short answer, because the Russians are unable to win it. In ten years America lost 59,000 lives in Vietnam. In one year and a half the Russians have lost more than 260,000 dead and there being slaughtered in large numbers every day. I could go on but then it wouldn't be a short answer.",
      "21": "Ukraine is winning the war with some support from Russia.",
      "22": "Uh, when it starts to lose the war?\nSo far, it has retaken 50% of the land that Russia occupied.\nI wouldn’t call that losing a war.",
      "23": "Neither side is winning this war; both Russia and Ukraine are losing. Tens of thousands of men on both sides killed and wounded. Modern weapons of war are even more lethal at chewing up human bodies, as compared to WW 2.",
      "24": "Because that is the plan.\nDid you not notice the supply of $Billions worth of modern weapons, supplies and equipment from many countries to ensure that aim is realised ?",
      "25": "Because it very definitely is and will win . M Trollin little gobshite… Like the fact or not .",
      "26": "Any impartial observer would stay that Ukraine has fought the Russians to a draw. You could argue that holding off the Russians (and even pushing them back a little) counts as a win, considering the sizes of the countries.\nDo you think Russians would have cheered Prigozhin if Russia was winning?",
      "27": "Because is not losing this war. If they were how you explain the Russia has not been able to gain significantly more of its territory recently",
      "28": "Let’s ask an expert; Russian Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov.\nOoooh … Too soon?",
      "29": "They are hoping for that hail Mary offensive.",
      "30": "I can’t speak for the west. I can speak for myself: Every day past the 5th day of Putin’s criminal military aggression I count as a win. It was a quick wham, bam, and we’ll be done, to listen to putin’s “ BS” to his nation back 17 months ago. And here we are nearing 1 and a half years that Russia hasn’t come close to winning. And now his forces have been run to ground, like the rats they are, back where they were 2014–2022 trying to wrest the Donbas region from its owners. There is no doubt in my mind that if the free world ( democratically governed nations) will perform their pledges to help UKraine fight off Russia’s sin against it, it will eventually end favorably for that nation. IMO. 😇",
      "31": "It’s not that Ukraine “is winning” they have lost a lot to be winners of sh…t destruction. But Russia is already defeated, as none of their main objectives for war are null. Ukraine is using Western strategies and tactics for going forward, as this war is a lot like a WW2 trenches war. Like Dog or Charlie sectors in Omaha Beach. It took a lot of lives, but they had a beachhead. Later, the Allies found ways to get around German defenses, way more advanced than today’s Russian trench defenses and inferior (compared) artillery and ground troops.",
      "32": "Not sure about “the West” Martin, but all of my family and friends in Ukraine affected by the occupation by Orcs, are reporting that areas around the Donetsk region are gradually being abandoned by the Orcs.\nThat must be indicative of a losing Russian army, in my humble opinion.",
      "33": "This is one reason, comrade.",
      "34": "Because it is backed up by independent evidence unlike the claims from Russia which aren't even consistent!",
      "35": "Because as a matter of fact, Ukraine is winning the war.\nRussians after first , surprising attack and due to a treachery of many military commanders of Ukraine made no any progress. The war is run more that 1.5 year and we see no any progress from RuSSian side.\nUkrainian army is well motivated , and working as enemy permit utilising blunder made by RuSSian’s command.This is not a football match ,and no last 45 min , break and second torment. The war will last long time as PooTin does not like to admit it’s failure .It’s take time to swallow bitter pill of failure:) and Ukraine has not so much human waste as RuSSia . Ukraine respect own soldiers .They are dying but they know for what purpose contrary to RuSSians",
      "36": "By every measure Russia is losing the war. Just about every one of their war aims has been defeated by the Ukrainians. For Russia it has been defeat after defeat after defeat. Remember, the original aim of the war (the “special military operation”) was to quickly invade Ukraine in a matter of weeks and then remove the Kyiv government. How spectacular a failure that was.\nNow, Russia is struggling to hold on to it’s occupied territories in the south and east. And the Ukrainians are now attacking Crimea.\nMy big tip for you. Don’t believe a single thing the Russian media says. They are just an extension of Putin’s mouth. Get rid of Putin - he is taking Russia to ruin.",
      "37": "That Ukraine is holding out against a supposed major power says a lot. Truth is Russia has already lost the war the best they can hope for is a phyrric victory.",
      "38": "Mainly because of reality consistently showing exactly that since Russia having been kicked out of Kyiv just a week into the invasion.\nIf you see something different you are suffering from serious cognitive deficits which might or might not be treatable with medication. Either way you are just a disposable Ruzzkidrone from some derelict Siberian village and I don’t care.",
      "39": "Well let's see, it's been over a year, almost a year and a half in fact, yet Russia still hasn't declared victory nor does it look like victory is anywhere in site. Does it look like Ukraine is losing?",
      "40": "It is. You are losing it but refuse to admit you are wrong.",
      "41": "Do you have any contrary lead from any impartial sources? China must have highlighted Putin's success,had Russia been in advantageous state. West is open Democratical and a society with freedom of thoughts expression plus gigantic media, where fake news stand bulldozed. There seems to be no basis for your assumptions to think otherwise of Ukrainians.",
      "42": "Because the West urgently wants Ukraine to win. They will win because they must win. And as Stoltenberg has made clear long ago: A defeat of Ukraine would also be a defeat of NATO. And that cannot be!",
      "43": "Russia is getting its ass handed to them. And your comment is the cry of a desperate foe who is wondering what they will do when they find themselves defeated and having to answer for all the war crimes Russia has committed.",
      "44": "For 2 reasons :\nIt is the absolute truth; and\nThe West isn't as delusional as Russia is.",
      "45": "Because at this stage all signs point to Ukraine being in a winning position.\nWhen this was first started Russia took large swathes of territory around Kyiv and Kharkiv, captured Kherson and completed a land bridge across southern Ukraine, and then began advancing in the east. This was to be the high watermark of Russia’s invasion, as while Russia was able to make advances in the east and take Severedonetsk and Lysychansk, at the same time Russia had to abandon their positions around Kyiv, were routed around Kharkiv, and were forced out of Kherson.\nThis is because Russia’s original land gains were only achieved with horrendous losses of men and material. While this happened Ukraine was receiving supplies from the west and forming new combat formations. This meant Ukraine was able to take the initiative, until Russia’s new mobilization. That was the point at which many pro-Russian people got really excited, about their new offensive with 300,000 men. And then that offensive happened, and it was so insipid that people spent weeks arguing if it had actually started or not. In the end, all it managed amidst horrendous losses was the capture of Ukraine’s 52nd biggest town, Bakhmut.\nWhile that offensive was petering out, Ukraine spent their time building new forces for a new offensive operation. The offensive is now underway, and after early attempts at breakthrough went poorly, Ukraine instead moved to an attritional model, using smaller units to take and hold small amounts, drawing responses from Russia’s artillery and mobile reserves, which it then targets with artillery and rocket fire. Once Ukraine believes sufficient attrition has taken place they are likely to attempt new breakthroughs.\nWhile we don’t know how this offensive will end up performing, we do know it is playing to the major weakness with Russia’s campaign - their inability to replace their constantly enormous losses. A lot of Russians have been quick to claim Ukraine has suffered equally, but this isn’t remotely believable, and also not the same - Ukrainian losses of T64 and BM-21 are replaced with Leopard 2 and HIMARS. Russian losses of T-90M are replaced by T55 pulled off the storage lot they’ve been sitting in since Kruschev was in power.\nAmmunition consumption is a similarly damning trend for Russia. At the height of their offensive Russia was firing around 50,000 artillery rounds a day, this all came from stockpiles that are now largely emptied, and Russia is estimated to only produce 700 new rounds a day. Russia has spoken a lot about increases to this, but it has undertaken strict ammo rationing and is buying whatever rounds it can from North Korea, indicating there is a very real problem. Ukraine has suffered from ammunition shortages since early in the war, but managed to offset that deficiency with greater recon and accuracy, and while still constrained it is increasingly less so, which combined with their existing advantages gives them a considerable advantage.\nDon’t get me wrong - this war isn’t over. But Russia squandered all their early advantages, while Ukraine has been able to leverage its own advantages and begin to gain dominance in some key areas. All signs point to Ukraine holding a significant advantage in the war.",
      "46": "Russia has taken a royal beating economically. It builds hypersonic missiles at 10 million a piece and gets to sit back and watch it get blown out of the sky from a patriot missile battery A missile that costed the US taxpayers 4.1 million in 1981.",
      "47": "THEY WANT TO PERPETUATE THE LIE THAT THEY ARE WINNING SO THEY CAN GIVE AWAY THE REST OF OUR MONEY SO THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY LEFT TO GIVE TO OUR SENIORS.",
      "48": "Because it is true. Maybe slowly but surely Ukrainian Arme broke the first line of defense in the south. Bahkmut is cut from supply and will be liberated soon. Yes, Russia prepared huge mine fields but it is just a matter of time and Russia doesn’t have any game changing option.",
      "49": "Because they’re continuing to reclaim more Ukrainian territory every day even though a lot is heavily mined, and russia controls less of Ukraine today than before their full scale invasion started which means they’re clearly not winning",
      "50": "Because the western media is following orders from their governments,and in unison are toe-ing the party line that Ukraine is winning…..Forget main stream media,if you want to know whats really going on,look on twitter investigative journalists accounts of whats really happening,Live Leak also. Long story short….Ukraine are losing badly ,in fact its a massacre……so carry on you deluded clowns on here ,with your “ukraine is winning BS”,wishful thinking wont win a war…..Zelensky and his crooked friend Biden have almost destroyed Ukraine."

    "title": "What was said at a funeral that you will never forget",
    "answers": {
      "1": "some people will think that this is not an appropriate thing to be said at a funeral, but to each their own. When I was 29, with a 2 year old and 5 month old, my 31 year old husband was killed in a car accident. I heard all the same bullshit that you hear at funerals (it’s gods plan, everything happens for a reason….all those unhelpful things), and honestly it just made me want to hide from everyone. But then my best friends dad walked up to me, gave me a hug and said “well this really sucks!”. It was the only thing I heard that day that didn’t have me running away from everyone.",
      "2": "My friend's mother was very involved with her church for decades and also the biggest racist I've ever had the misfortune to know.\nThe vicar who knew her extremely well said several nice things about her then said, “We cannot talk about Helen without touching on her very unpleasant views. Sadly much of the Bible's teachings seem to have passed her by. However hopefully God will forgive her as I know many of us do find that difficult.” There was a collective sharp intake of breath and I thought, good for him.",
      "3": "During my father’s funeral, the altar boys set off the fire alarm while lighting incense. Because we knew what set off the alarm, everyone remained in the sanctuary until the fire department arrived and the alarm was reset. The mourners who had only known Dad in his later years thought we, his family, were very upset at this. From behind, all they could see were our shaking bodies and tears as we looked around. The priest looked mortified.\nWhat they didn’t know was that we were laughing hysterically. Dad had been a volunteer fireman most of his adult life, and a huge prankster. If his spirit didn’t personally do something to cause the incense fiasco, we all knew he was watching from heaven and enjoying a good laugh with his fellow firefighters who preceded him. Nothing was actually said about this during the funeral, but I will always believe that Dad got the last word.",
      "4": "My dad died.\nI remember a car trip from Oregon to Mount Saint Helens and back for the Eclipse. He’d tell a joke, I’d tell a joke, he’d tell a joke, I’d tell a joke, for the entire trip, non stop jokes. Never the same joke, twice. Drove everyone else in the car nuts.\nAs people came in for the service, I had the Ushers ask the guests if they were there for the Bride, or the Groom.\nA moment of stunned silence, then loud laughter. “That’s just like Ray, he had a joke for every occasion.”\nI miss my dad.",
      "5": "My mother was a saint. Yes, a SAINT. never had a bad word to say about anyone…ANYONE. Never did anything that wasn’t for the benefit of others.\nYes, I glorified the woman. And rightly so.\nAt her funeral, the minister asked a simple question: “if Miss Ida ever enriched your life, would you please stand?”\nTHE ENTIRE CONGREGATION STOOD. Including my old and very deaf dad, who later asked me, “Why did we all stand up?”\nI said, “Well, Dad, the minister asked us to stand if Mama had ever been a positive influence in our lives.”\nHis response: “Well, it's a good thing I stood up, then.”",
      "6": "When my husband died, my mother- in- law (MIL) tried to hijack the funeral. My husband had known for a while he was likely to die young and had been very explicit in how he wished services be conducted. He warned me his mother would likely try to make it all about herself. He was not wrong. She objected to most everything chosen from his clothing to the music, the officiant, the casket, even personal family traditions from my family. In the week between his death and his services, she made it known to anyone in my small home town who would listen how much of a total witch I was cutting her out of the arrangements. Not even my father-in-law, a man I loved dearly, could get her to calm down. I was a wreck. I was 38, having just lost my 46 yr old husband. My MIL destroying my reputation to inflate the sympathy she was receiving. It was a mess. All I could do was hold the pieces of myself together by the threads and try to be the bigger person. And, yes, she knew the arrangements I was implementing, including the delay of services for family to arrive from out of town, had been explicitly at my husband’s direction before his death.\nDuring the viewing before the funeral, his aunt, my MIL's sister, came to me by the casket. She said she knew I was goinf thru a terrible time and that she wanted to apologize for the way my MIL was acting (imagine the worst overacted dramedy you can imagine) instead of grieving naturally. Aunt then said how much she loved, respected, and admired me for my strength and character to not respond publically to MIL's antics. She then assured me she and the other sisters were putting a stop to the behavior so the children and I could grieve in some measure of peace. That was the moment that finally almost broke me. The simple love from his aunt was so much more than I expected. I will never forget that lovely woman or what she said and did that day.",
      "7": "Not so much what was said AT the funeral than what was said BEFORE it. Missy, just 15 years old, had committed suicide. Prior to the service her pastor commented he could not give a proper eulogy as she would be going to hell. Approximately 6 hours before the funeral, family was looking for a pastor who wouldn't condemn the poor girl before her burial. The funeral turned out lovely, and I am forever grateful to the young pastor who gave a beautiful eulogy to a girl he never met.",
      "8": "When I was eleven years old, a friend drowned while swimming alone at a local lake. He was alone because I had persuaded a mutual friend who was supposed to go with him, instead, to come visit me at my house, because I was grounded from leaving the house, but I could have a friend come over.\nDenny’s was the first funeral I remember attending, and I walked into the funeral home alone. I was terrified and overcome with remorse and shame. Not quite knowing what to do, I slipped in the back and sat in the first chair I saw with no one near it.\nAlmost immediately, Denny’s mother came over and sat next to me. She said, “This is not your fault. You did not kill Denny. Tragic accidents happen all the time, sweetheart. Don’t carry this through your life. If you do, that will be a tragic accident too. When you leave today, leave any guilt you might feel right here so that we can bury it as well.\nThen she hugged me while I cried. I did exactly as she said. And I have never forgotten the witness of her grace.",
      "9": "I knew a nice young lady in the mid 70s, married right out of high school. As happens it was a mistake and they divorced. She married again, his 1st and they had 2 boys. The younger, maybe 6 or 7, walked behind a horse they owned on their farm and it kicked out striking the boy in the head killing him. At the funeral the small church was packed. The pastor conducting the funeral service reaching the point where he would give the eulogy stated that God does not recognize divorce, therefore the mother was an adulterous living in sin and the death of her younger son, her baby was God's punishment. I couldn't believe what I heard, a young mother and father suffering the loss of their son and this pastor lays a guilt trip like this on them! They divorced and she lived just her and her surviving son. I think once he was grown he was able to convince his mother to date again and she met someone and married again. Hopefully she was able to find peace and be happy once again. I will never forget the cruelty of that pastor.",
      "10": "When my Dad died, my Mom and all 6 of the kids decided my oldest brother and Dad’s best friend would speak at the funeral. The funeral was lovely and the pastor asked if anyone else would like to say anything after the two speakers had their time. My youngest niece (who was about six) decided it was her time to shine. This little girl calmly walked up the church aisle to the front, looked at the about 100 attendees, and said the most darling speech ever. She talked about how Grandpa loved his grandchildren, he taught them to fish, he taught them to play guitar, and he always had time for them. She was very solemn and very adorable. When she finished, she gave a courtesy, said “Thank you for learning about Grandpa,” and returned to her seat. NOT A DRY EYE IN THE BUILDING. Somehow this little girl was able to capture who my Dad was when nobody else could.",

He did it in a particularly awful way, by taking a whole, whole lot of aspirin and bleeding to death internally.\nEnter the young priest at the cathedral. We all wanted a good send off. This guy! His Spanish was passable. Now Juan had committed suicide, which is a mortal sin in this religion. He had been cremated, which is against our customs at least. He was gay. This gentle priest reminded everyone in Spanish that Jesus had forgiven the murderers he was crucified with. He said that it isn’t up to mankind to decide to forgive and we can’t guess who might be forgiven by God. He said that God is kind to the suffering of man. He said that under the circumstances, he could understand Juan wanting to be cremated. He had wanted us to remember him the way he had been. He said that Juan had been a lover of mankind. Oh. All in Spanish. Even though he thinks in English and has to translate a lot of things to speak Spanish, (like me) his language skills were smooth that day and his heart was good.",

I was sitting beside her when one of the kids asked her if she was going to die soon.\nThe aunt said, “no. She said she wasn’t going to die until everyone had a good look at her new knees”.\nAt that point, she pulled up her dress high enough to show the kid her knees. They traced the roadmap of perfect scars with their fingers and the kid was impressed that there were so many. He didn’t know you could get new knees. The aunt called people over to see her new knees. Everyone congratulated her, and she beamed. The kid brought other children over to see the scars.\nAt the same funeral, I stood with my uncle who was shaky and emotional over his wife’s death. He was tearing up while standing in the middle of the gathering room with me.\nAt that point, my uncle’s cousin, Muriel, joined us. In her mid 80s, she was still over 6 feet tall. She put her hand on my uncle’s shoulder to steady herself as she reached down to rub her leg. Muriel ignored the tears in my uncle’s eyes and said, “George, I want you to know that in honour of Mabel’s life and death, I shaved my legs for the funeral today. It took me all bloody morning!”\nThis made my uncle laugh. They had been children together. He assured Muriel that Mabel would have appreciated the effort, as did he.\nThis small event helped my uncle begin to talk to people. He was okay after that.",

      "22": "My eldest daughter has high-functioning autism—what used to be called Asperger’s Syndrome. An all-too-common stereotype of these individuals is that they have no emotions. She DOES have deep emotions, believe me, but she is much more subtle about conveying them and is not as openly dramatic as her sister.\nMy father-in-law, her grandfather, passed when she was 16. For her entire life, he’d lived 10 minutes away and been a part of all major holidays and birthdays.\nBut even I didn’t realize how deeply attached to him she was until the funeral. She collapsed in broken-hearted sobs and was pretty much inconsolable. At one point, I had to take her outside the room, just holding her and comforting her as best I could, so that others could hear the service, because her sobbing was that loud.\nI will never forget that and regard it as the truest display of grief I’ve ever seen. And I’m sure if her grandpa had seen it, he would’ve smiled to know she loved him that much.\nEDIT: I truly didn’t expect this response; it’s sort of overwhelming. I shared it with my daughter, and she is so proud (she just said “Yeah”, but she had a big smile on her face; you have to know how to interpret the signs.)

There were enough cars to effectively drown out the priest. When the priest would call for a moment of silence or reflection, there was no traffic whatsoever. In fact, you could hear the birds in the trees.\nThe moment the priest started, yet again, to try to give “words of comfort”, traffic would flow yet again.\nThinking about it, it was incredibly funny.

I adored my grandparents. They married in 1929 and my grandpa died first, one month after his 90th birthday in 1997.

      "44": "My husband's mother told me an unforgettable story about herself.\nBack in the Seventies it was unusual to find a divorced woman with 4 kids in a southern small town. She was very independent, and worked 3 different jobs close to home so she could be there whenever her kids needed her. She was working at a little convenience store close to the elementary school so her kids could just walk there after school. Every weekday a large group of kids leaving the school would come by her store, depositing her 3 oldest kids as it headed into the nearby neighborhood. Her kids would wait for an hour or so while she finished up working.\nIt was a Friday, all the kids were leaving the school excitedly coming down the street in a big herd. Her 3rd son, 7 year old, was especially excited as he was going to a sleepover at his best friend's house that night. They had been planning it all week and he had barely been able to sleep the night before in anticipation of all the fun they were going to have. As the large group began making its way down the street, he saw his sleepover buddy across the road and dashed out in front of a truck that was going by. He got hit. His mother was told and she came running to him and scooped up his little body and held him as his life-force drained away. He passed in her arms in the road, surrounded by his friends. Unbelievably terrible experience for her and her little family to weather. She was in shock and her family rallied around her to help her get through the funeral. As she sat numbly receiving condolences, a woman walked up with a little boy. The woman leaned in and took her hand and looked into her eyes and said “I'm so sorry for your loss. My son and I didn't know your little boy but I wanted to show him what happens when kids play in traffic.”",
      "45": "When my mother died, her minister told a story I’d never heard: how Mum and Dad met. I knew that they met en route to India, but I didn’t know the precise details. My dad, a shy man, asked my mother, whom he’d never met, if she wouldn’t mind carrying a suitcase through Customs for him. Why did he do this? The contents were for his sister, who was a nurse with The Leprosy Mission. He had brought her some ladies’ underwear, and didn’t want Customs to open his bag and reveal he was a cross-dresser! Dad was more embarrassed about that possibility, than about speaking to a complete stranger, and a woman, to boot. They got engaged, nine days later.",

My friend was a nun. Her uncle died. Her aunt was never known to show much love for him but at the funeral she was making a real scene, practically throwing herself on the coffin. Some relative asked my nun friend wearing full habit to go “ comfort” the aunt. My friend walked up and put her arm around her aunt and loudly announced. ” Stop this. Everyone knows he died to get away from you”. The aunt stayed very quiet after that.\nStrangest. I was a probation officer for teen girls in the 70s. I was also the guardian to one of the girls. Her boyfriend killed her. Her best friend was on the run… because she had stuck a gun in my stomach and pulled the trigger. Yay for safetys but there was warrant out for attempted murder . I was sobbing next the coffin. I heard a familiar sob. It was the girl who tried to shoot me. We immediately hugged and cried and sat holding hands. My new husband came up and said “ Is that the girl who tried to kill you? “ I reminded him it was a funeral. He wanted the police called. I said it was neutral territory . He said “‘Who do you think you are… the Godfather? “. BTW, 50 years later that girl and I are still close. We both lost the same thing.",
      "48": "My mother was an alcoholic all of her life from early teens, she was never around much after my father got custody of us, she had a very troubled childhood which led to her addiction, I was 19 when she died and she was 39. She was a very violent woman.Her funeral was a small affair as she pretty much alienated everyone and only had drinking associates. The vicar really didn't know what to say at her funeral and said very little and this has always resonated with me, he was literally stumbling over his words as my Mother had achieved nothing in her life and was viscious to everyone and completely wasted it by not processing trauma and doing everything she could to remain intoxicated all the time, I always think how sad it was that there was nothing to say about her. I hope I never have to go to another funeral again where there is nothing to say about a person's life and it made me more determined than ever that I would live a full healthy life.",

      "1": "Cats do not say \"meow\" when they purr. Purring is a separate vocalization produced by the vibration of the laryngeal muscles and diaphragm. It results in a continuous, rhythmic sound that is distinct from a cat's \"meow\". A \"meow\" is typically a single, sharper sound that cats use to communicate with humans or other animals, while purring is usually associated with contentment and relaxation, although it can also be a sign of distress or illness."

      "2": "The dietary needs of elderly people can vary based on factors such as their health status, activity level, and individual preferences. However, generally speaking, elderly individuals should aim for a balanced eating pattern that includes regular meals and snacks to meet their nutritional requirements. Here are some guidelines for how often elderly people should eat:\nRegular Meals: Elderly individuals should aim to have three balanced meals per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. These meals should include a mix of protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and a variety of vitamins and minerals.\nSnacks: Including nutritious snacks between meals can help provide a steady source of energy and nutrients throughout the day. Aim for 1-2 healthy snacks between meals, especially if there are long gaps between eating.\nHydration: Staying hydrated is essential for overall health. Encourage elderly individuals to drink fluids throughout the day, including water, herbal tea, and clear soups.\nListen to Hunger and Fullness Cues: Encourage elderly individuals to pay attention to their hunger and fullness cues. Eating when hungry and stopping when satisfied is important for maintaining a healthy relationship with food.\nNutrient Density: As metabolism may slow down with age, it's important to choose nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins and minerals without excessive calories.\nConsultation with Healthcare Professionals: Individual dietary recommendations should be based on a person's health conditions, medications, and any dietary restrictions. Consulting with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance.\nFiber Intake: Adequate fiber intake is important for digestive health. Include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes to ensure a good intake of dietary fiber.\nProtein Intake: Protein is important for maintaining muscle mass and overall health. Include lean sources of protein, such as poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts.\nCalcium and Vitamin D: Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is important for bone health. Include sources of these nutrients, such as dairy products, fortified foods, and sunlight exposure.\nModeration: Encourage portion control and moderation, as excessive calorie intake can lead to weight gain.\nRemember that individual needs can vary, so it's important for elderly individuals to consult with their healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to create a meal plan that best suits their unique requirements and health goals.",

However, individual dietary needs can vary, so it's important to consider factors like their activity level, medical conditions, and appetite.

However, it is still important for elderly people to eat regular meals and snacks to get the nutrients they need.\nThe exact number of meals and snacks that an elderly person should eat will vary depending on their individual needs. However, a good rule of thumb is to eat three meals and two snacks per day.

      "20": "I would recommend three times a day. Elderly people need to exercise daily. Going for a one mile walk is the least distance you should do. I would like to see more seniors go for a two to five walk every day. If you don’t walk and circulate the blood, you will get a stroke or heart attack guaranteed. The muscles of the body atrophy if you don’t use them so you need to move the large muscles thru aerobic exercise daily. You also need more protein than younger people. It is a great idea to take a digestive enzyme to help you digest your food because your digestive system may not be able to break down food efficiently like before. Take a great multivitamin to make sure you are not deficient vitamins or minerals. Many elderly people suffer from vitamin B12 deficiencies which creates serious health problems. Prepare your food at home to save you money and improve your health tremendously. You don’t know if the food you eat outside is healthy for you or if the person preparing it cares about your health. Avoid sugar and fast food. You may have gotten away with it when you were younger but you will pay a high price if you eat junk or fast food like heart disease or cancer. Hope that helps you.",

      "22": "Elderly people, like individuals of any age, should generally follow a regular meal schedule to ensure they receive adequate nutrition and maintain good health. However, specific dietary needs and meal frequency can vary from person to person based on factors such as age, health status, activity level, and personal preferences. Here are some general guidelines for meal frequency for elderly individuals:\nThree Meals a Day: Many elderly people find it beneficial to eat three main meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. These meals should provide a balanced mix of nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.\nHealthy Snacks: In addition to main meals, some elderly individuals may benefit from consuming healthy snacks between meals to maintain energy levels and prevent excessive hunger. These snacks can include fruits, vegetables, nuts, yogurt, or whole-grain crackers.\nHydration: It's essential for elderly individuals to stay well-hydrated, so they should also drink water throughout the day. Adequate hydration is crucial for overall health and can help prevent issues like dehydration, which is more common in older adults.\nConsider Dietary Restrictions: Some elderly individuals may have specific dietary restrictions or medical conditions that require them to eat smaller, more frequent meals. For example, individuals with diabetes may benefit from spreading their food intake throughout the day to help manage blood sugar levels.\nConsultation with a Healthcare Provider: It's advisable for elderly individuals to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine their specific dietary needs. These professionals can provide personalized recommendations based on an individual's health status and nutritional requirements.\nMedication Considerations: Some medications may need to be taken with food, while others should be taken on an empty stomach. Elderly individuals should follow their healthcare provider's guidance regarding when and how to take their medications.\nChewing and Digestion: Some elderly people may experience difficulties with chewing or digestion, which can impact their meal frequency and food choices. In such cases, softer or more easily digestible foods may be recommended.\nSocial and Emotional Factors: Mealtime can be a social and enjoyable part of the day for elderly individuals. Sharing meals with family and friends can have emotional and mental health benefits, so these factors should also be considered.\nIn summary, the frequency of meals for elderly people can vary, but it's generally recommended to have three main meals a day, with the inclusion of healthy snacks as needed. Individualized dietary plans should take into account the person's health, dietary restrictions, and preferences. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian can help tailor a meal plan to meet the specific needs of elderly individuals."

    "answers": {
      "1": "I am wondering the same. I eat out in good restaurants by myself all the time. Very good unwinding and pampering time, especially after a tough day at work.\nMost of my friends though feel it is weird but eat out at fast food chains by themselves.",
      "2": "You're talking about people who spend an unhealthy amount of time worrying about what others will think of them.",
      "3": "When I was young it was considered either unseemly or pitiful for women to eat alone in public. Unseemly because of perceived danger from caddish men or pitiful because the woman could not attract a male protector who would be paying the bill.\nThe world has changed.\nI have no problem eating alone in restaurants. Or vacationing alone and doing so in a foreign country.",
      "4": "Original question: Why do some people in America say it is strange to go out to eat at a fancy resturant by yourself/alone for lunch/dinner? If you are alone and out in public people expect you to eat fast food instead of getting a nice meal served, why?\nI haven’t lived in the US for a long while, but I do have relatives and friends there with whom I try to keep in touch. I also try to keep up with current events there (and elsewhere, too).\nI have never heard anyone, or heard of anyone, American or otherwise, saying that it’s strange to eat alone at a fancy restaurant, nor that if one is alone, one should eat fast food and avoid higher-end restaurants.\nI suppose it’s possible that some people may find it unusual, because their own experience of eating in such restaurants has been limited, and they happen never to have encountered solo diners. If that’s the case, then they need to learn that what is unfamiliar to them is not necessarily “strange”.\nIt certainly isn’t anyone’s business whether you choose to eat at a good restaurant in company or alone.",
      "5": "It isn’t strange people do it all the time. When traveling for work for example you might dine out for all meals. Dining alone means finding something to do while you wait. People watching, reading a book or newspaper or playing on a device. It is slower and more expensive than fast food but you have more choice of foods. The reason many of us dine out instead of eating at home is to enjoy the people we are with. I wouldn’t mind going to an ethnic restaurant I have never been to but to go alone, decide what that food is and order something would seem odd. If I can get someone to go with me they might know what the food is or we can each other different things and if I hate mine they might want it. We can taste what each other got and maybe find a new thing we like. Or I can find recipes and try to make things at home but won’t know if it is correct.",
      "6": "I haven’t so much heard people say they think it’s odd for others to do it. Usually I hear, “I’m not brave enough to eat alone in public.” Or something similar. Also, it isn’t just about “fancy” restaurants but greasy spoons or fast food joints too. People just find it terribly awkward to eat by themselves in public for some reason.\nIs it an American thing? Do other countries find this behavior odd? I honestly don’t know. It’s just all I’ve ever known. I will eat alone when events necessitate it, and as a more introverted person, I don’t mind the quietness or being alone. But my social awkwardness causes me to wonder if people are looking at me thinking, “Aw, that poor woman all alone.” In reality, I doubt they even notice my presence, much less think anything about me.",
      "7": "Not trying to be a wiseguy, but you could probably replace everything after “why do some people in America say“ with any sentence and it would probably be true.\nAfter all, we have over 300 million people in America so you’re likely to find somebody that would say anything. But I do think this is largely a cultural change, when I was a kid you’d rarely see anybody other than a businessman out to dinner by him or her self, (they were actually very few businesswomen when I was a kid), but nowadays it doesn’t seem to be nearly as big a deal.\nI am single and my kids are grown, so if I want to go out to a restaurant, I’m likely to go out by myself. I don’t typically go to fancy restaurants alone, but if I wanted to I could.\nI have never sensed that anybody thought I should be eating fast food when I go to a sitdown restaurant alone. In fact, I often receive extra attention from the server although that probably has more to do with the type of restaurants I go to then anything else.",
      "8": "I don’t know. I am older and several of my friends are widows/widowers who have no interest in dating again. If any of us want to eat out alone at a nice place, then we do. I don't give a shit what anyone “expects” me to do. I like good food and I have never had a problem w/ a restaurant serving it to me if I am alone. I do not eat fast food, it’s good but not healthy. I am into being fit & healthy these days.\nThe question I ask myself is why people take kids too young to behave to restaurants meant for grown ups where they do not have a kids menu and the kids get bored, act up and ruin the atmosphere for everyone else who wanted to eat & converse in peace. There are lots of family restaurants that cater to kids, take yours to one of them or hire a sitter.",
      "9": "Because people - and not just Americans - are funny. I never let it worry me. If I’m by myself, I eat at the restaurant of my choice.",
      "10": "Probably for the same reason some people say that in other countries. Some people, myself included (British) would view a “fancy restaurant” as the last choice to eat alone. Equally one of my best friends who is American would have a “fancy“ (well reviewed) restaurant at the top of his list. We both travel (or have) extensively .. I spent a decade working away in various places 75% of the year and 2 more decades living in other countries.",
      "11": "I’m quite certain that some people in places besides America say the same thing about lone diners.\nI occasionally eat out by myself and I do not like the majority of fast food offerings. I have no problem eating at a restaurant alone, and the restaurants don’t seem to have any problems serving me.",
      "12": "I’ve never heard that. Some people feel self-conscious about dining alone in a restaurant - but it really doesn’t worry anyone else.\nYou used to see people dining along with a book or magazine. Nowadays, people amuse themselves with their phones. Mostly, these are people on business trips alone.\nOn a business trip, I will alternate between room service and dining at the hotel restaurant. In some cases, the room service menu is limited, and you I do not feel like anything on the regular menu - in which case I look for a different place to eat. Some solo diners will sit at the bar - however, this is not always as comfortable as a regular table. When I back in my home city (Montreal), I like to get out for a walk on the way to dinner.",
      "13": "I have never understood why this seems such a strange thing. But I pay no attention. I eat out alone when I want to. Often I have a book with me; sometimes I don’t.\nNo waiter has ever given me any reason to think they thought I was doing anything strange.",
      "14": "A fancy place for me is any one with waiters/waitresses. Lots cheaper to dine alone and not argue about what to order. Plus some folks like to enjoy their meals without a bunch of chit chat.",
      "15": "Not just in one country but all over the world there are those who have this notion that there's something wrong with eating without an escort.\nI’ve dined out alone in many parts of the world all my life. I’m not interested in whether or not anyone finds it unusual.\nSome people are incapable of going to the supermarket alone.",
      "16": "I honestly don’t think it has anything to do with the person eating alone. I think it may have to do with people feeling uncomfortable when they see someone eating alone.",
      "17": "the social aspect of it. going out fancy is a together thing, a celerbration, an agenda. so maybe they think it is sad? I do for myself. I’ve gotten so used to “go out to eat with family” that doing it by myself is weird. even if it’s just a cafe, or a pizzareia. fast food is on the go. maybe I’m on my way somewhere? if I need to wait for a meal, I’m not. eating is social. fast food is seen as junk food. not real. desperation, lowbrow.",
      "18": "Because many people are terrified that strangers they will never interact with will think they're lonely, have no friends and can't convince anyone to go out with them. They also won't go to a movie alone because they think other people will pity them for not having anyone to go with them, even though it may not be the case.",
      "19": "I don’t because I prefer to share a fancy meal with others. I am a good cook. I can always cook good food for myself and there is a Cooperative that I live buy that sells organic, pre made foods. If I don’t want to cook, I will pick up something there.",
      "20": "Some people say many strange things.",
      "21": "It should not be a problem. But feels uncomfortable. Good movie, Lost In Translation by Sofia Coppola, Bill Murray travels alone but finds a friend in a group alone. I think some hours are harder when friends work at different places and cannot eat together. So lots of in office lunches or maybe work companions together.",
      "22": "Some people do think it is strange to see someone eating alone. But those people are just nosy. If you want to go to a fancy restaurant alone then you should do it and don’t pay attention to any one else.",
      "23": "I think that is an old fashioned notion. I see no reason why a person can’t go into a restaurant and enjoy a nice meal .",
      "24": "I used to travel alone on business trips. What you are describing is how the lone diner feels not the ither diners, they don’t care.\nThe trick to eating alone at a nice restaurant is to sit at the bar and order a meal. At dinner time, pretty much every one at the bar will be by themselves so it’s easy to start a conversation. In the 90’s I heard about 49 different states that were about to have “the next silicon valley.",
      "25": "Some people think eating at a fancy restaurant is more about socializing than being fed. You’re not supposed to celebrate yourself, by yourself.",
      "26": "Some people are stupid and there’s no reason why their opinions should matter to you. If you want to go to a restaurant by yourself, do it. There’s nothing strange or wrong with it.",
      "27": "Speaking for myself only, it isn’t any kind of social pressure. I am just uncomfortable going solo, whether it’s a sit-down restaurant or a movie theater. To me, they seem to be inherently social activities. So, I just don’t do those things while solo.",
      "28": "Under BIDENomics, people don’t expect Deplorables to have enough money to eat at nice restaurants, alone or otherwise.",
      "29": "It’s incredibly disingenuous to begin a question with “Why do some people in America say….?” — usually a setup for a really stupid premise.",

      "32": "Why do you worry so much about what “some people” think or say? If you wanna go to lunch/dinner by yourself there is nobody stopping you.",
      "33": "I LIVE BY MYSELF AND NEVER EAT AT FAST FOOD! I ALWAYS EAT ONLY AT GOOD RESTAURANTS BEING WAITER SERVED!!!",
      "34": "People think we should be like the animals on Noah's Arc two by twos. Not always the case. Restaurants have a tendency to be crowded and a little claustrophobic. I have gone to a restaurant with early breakfast bars and ate by myself on the way to a community college classes . I've ordered meals at a local Mexican restaurant as carryout and its easier than sitting in a crowded restaurant.",

      "37": "I do think it's strange to spend a lot of money for a fancy meal you don't know how it's prepared or what's in it. Especially since you can cook it for a lot less. And fast food, real crap that's even worse for you.",
      "38": "Well, some people think doing anything outside home alone is strange. I do a lot of activities alone and never had anyone specifically call out eating alone at a nice restaurant as weird. I personally don’t do it very often just because those meals tend to take longer and I get bored being by myself and waiting. I also find I try less things bc most dishes are meant to be shared so it’s more than I could eat and it’s likely awfully expensive to order something and just eat a small portion.",
      "39": "I think the reason could be because they think they stand out in the crowd by being alone. I feel this in restaurants, sometimes. My solution is to eat at diners, coffee shops and less formal restaurants. In diners, solo diners are very common. Also, cafes that sell light lunches are nice. I don’t think people expect solo diners to eat only fast food. The other solution is not to worry what other people think, and enjoy your meal.",

      "43": "Because it is pathetic to be spotted eating in a halfway decent restaurant by yourself. Go to a diner or a fast food emporium instead. You will survive it. Back in the day when we had luncheonettes it was acceptable to be alone at one. Those were different. Eating is vastly overrated. You can survive a whole day for about 2.00 worth of food if you plan it right."

The US had to invent a boating incident to motivate it's people for war.\nSecond, did Russia actively deliver most of Vietnam s weapon during this war? Answer: it did not. There were some Soviet military advisors, that was it. They got the weapons pre war afaik. It was China that supported North Vietnam, not so much Russia.\nAnd by the way, ISIS, Al quaida, Al nusra etc use a shit ton of US weapons… e.g. m16s, humvees etc. What does that mean then..

      "20": "Hardly a reason not to complain.\nAfter all, how can the United States claim Russia is doing anything wrong after Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, etc……\nThey can do it because none of these situations are really related.\nThis is not an endorsement of what Russia did, or eve a criticism of what the United States has done.\nIt is a fact that Russia is complaining not that it thinks the United States will be influenced by what they claim, but because their is a wider audience, the rest of the World, which might have a different view than you or the average westerner.",

As many have noted here Putin wants a free hand to murder all Ukrainians in any manner he so chooses. the fact his plans are failing he must complain because his troops are appalling in every manner to humanity and is not a force able to subdue these pesky Ukrainians.\nSince 2013 I have always viewed Putin as our Hitler of our times, I have always believed I will see WW3 and that Russia will start this war. Today we are very close to WW3 breaking out. To ignore Putin and allow him to get his way is to ignore the evil that resides in the Kremlin.\nWhere do we stop and take a stand? we will should remember Chamberlain and his “peace in our time” treaty, Putin and Russia in general as shown the world no one can trust anything they say. Putin threatens nuclear today and he will do the same against Poland Moldova, the Baltics and more, so it is best to face this evil man now!\n“Never Again”, must have some meaning or the world can forget it and live in fear as many other dictators will do the same.\nPeople have wondered why Germans never spoke out against Hitler, today we see this attitude repeating in Russia. For the Russian citizens have ignored the pain and suffering the removing of liberties and the violation of their own constitution for his whole reign of terror.\nPutin faces death by his many illnesses so he is not long for this world and seeks to leave behind a memory of his reign. however what he will leave behind is a memory of a new Hitler and the destruction of his own nation as the Federation will break up because of Putin’s actions. we are witnessing this before our eyes, Russia will be a much smaller place soon and Putin will be gone from this life.\nRussians like Germans are ignoring to their own peril “evil so outrageous” that the mind struggles to understand the depth of depravity of such leaders.",
      "29": "A lot has changed since the end of the Cold War. The US, Russia, China and other countries have made agreements about this issue. For example, Russia did not support Iraq when the US and Britain made plans to invade that country. The US and Britain could not have intervened to overthrow the Saddam regime during the cold war, because Russia would have supplied the necessary arms to the Saddam regime to make sure the US and Britain could not set up a base in Kuwait to attack Iraq from. In 2003 Russia strongly objected to the Iraq war, but per the post Cold War agreements, Russia did not send arms to Iraq to help Iraq fight off the US and British army.\nAlso, after 9/11 US laws had been changed allowing for people to be convicted for inciting terrorism when they support a non-state actor in a war. Under this US law, two Saudi nationals were extradited from Britain to the US and there they were convicted of inciting terrorism. What did they do? They posted YouTube videos of the same sort that are uploaded by the Ukrainian army on a daily basis, showing attacks on Russian forces in the Caucasus.\nYou see, Bush and Putin were big friends. They did have some disagreements but they did agree that powerful nations had the right to use force and that disagreements between powerful nations about that should not lead to them intervening in each other’s wars. Also they agreed that any resistance from non-state actors against their militaries amounted to terrorism. By implication this made what the Saudis did an act of incitement to terrorism.\nThis is also why at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Pentagon lawyers were considering if Ukraine could be supported if Russia were able to topple the Zelenskiy government. It was not clear if this would make the US guilty of a terrorist offense.\nSo, it should be clear tha...",

    "title": "What do many people still not understand",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Many people still do not fully understand the physiological and psychological reasons behind the need to sleep under some form of covering, such as a sheet or blanket.\nOne key aspect is the sensation of temperature experienced by individuals, which can vary widely even for those sharing the same bed. This variation is not solely influenced by the surrounding environment but is also a result of individual factors, including metabolism. Women, in particular, tend to be more sensitive to temperature changes, which can affect their preference for covering during sleep.\nAdditionally, this behavior has almost become a cultural tradition or ritual for many people. Using a sheet or blanket before bedtime is viewed as customary, something individuals have grown accustomed to over time. It's not just about keeping warm; it's a practice deeply ingrained in our habits and comfort zones.",
      "2": "For 65% of individuals, regardless of whether it's warm or chilly, there's a need to sleep under some form of covering.\nFrancisco Javier Puertas, a representative of the Spanish Sleep Society, sheds light on this behaviour. He asserts that many can attest to this sensation, especially in their extremities like hands and feet. This explains why some find it essential to wear socks to bed.\nInterestingly, two individuals sharing the same bed might perceive temperature differently on any given night. This is because the sensation of temperature change is felt at a bodily level rather than being influenced by the surrounding environment.\nMetabolism plays a significant role in this, with women tending to be more sensitive to such changes.\nLastly, Puertas highlights the almost cultural significance of using a sheet or blanket. It's seen as a customary practice, a ritual many have grown accustomed to. \"It's simply what we're used to,\" he remarks.",
      "3": "Many people still do not fully understand the psychological and physiological comfort that comes with the need to sleep under some form of covering, even in various weather conditions. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"covering\" or \"blanket\" culture. Regardless of whether it's warm or chilly, a significant portion of individuals, approximately 65%, find it soothing and conducive to sleep when they have a lightweight blanket, sheet, or some form of covering over them. This behavior can be traced back to primal instincts related to safety, security, and the need for a sense of cocooning, which can help promote better sleep quality and relaxation. While it may seem counterintuitive to cover up in warm weather, it is a phenomenon deeply ingrained in human behavior, reflecting the complexity of our psychological and sensory experiences.\nFrancisco Javier Puertas, a representative of the Spanish Sleep Society, provides valuable insights into this behavior. He emphasizes that many people can relate to the sensation of needing to cover certain parts of their bodies, especially extremities like hands and feet, when they sleep. This phenomenon is often the reason why some individuals find it essential to wear socks to bed. The inclination to cover specific body parts is linked to the body's thermoregulation process, as keeping extremities warm can aid in promoting better sleep by regulating body temperature. Puertas' explanation sheds light on the intricate relationship between our sensory experiences, comfort, and the quality of sleep we experience.\nIndeed, it's fascinating how two individuals sharing the same bed may perceive temperature differently on any given night. This divergence in perception is primarily due to the fact that the sensation of temperature change is deeply rooted at the bodily level and is influenced by individual factors rather than solely by the surrounding environment.\nMetabolism plays a substantial role in this disparity, as it affects how our bodies generate and retain heat. It's worth noting that women often exhibit more sensitivity to temperature changes than men, which can lead to varying comfort levels in shared sleeping spaces.\nFrancisco Javier Puertas highlights an important aspect of this behavior—the cultural significance of using a sheet or blanket. For many people, it's not just about physical comfort; it's a customary practice and a ritual that they have grown accustomed to over time. This cultural and psychological aspect underscores the role of habits and traditions in our nightly routines, contributing to the sense of comfort and security that comes with covering up while sleeping."

    "question_id": "https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Thor-become-funny-in-Ragnarok-and-after",
    "title": "Why did Thor become funny in Ragnarok and after",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Thor is already funny even from very first appeMost verily fellow Asgardians, another Thorsday is upon us! Thor has always been known for his very formal way of speaking, with a proud accent that calls to mind Shakespearean actors delivering dialogue, rather than an ancient warrior in the midst of battle. Regardless, the god of thunder manages to deliver humor, intensity, and occasionally sass in his quotable quips.\nToday we have a list of Thor’s most iconic movie lines; quotes that instantly bring the thunder to any conversation. Make every day Thorsday by tossing a few of these mighty sayings into your regular vocabulary!\n“This drink, I like it! ANOTHER!” (Thor, 2011)\nOne of Thor’s most well-known lines from the original movie involves him smashing a mug in a New Mexico diner while asking for a refill of his coffee. He quickly learns that this is not acceptable behavior on Midgard, and apologizes. In a deleted scene, Thor even returns to the diner to replace the mug he shattered.\nDespite learning the error of his ways, this line has persisted in representing his bold warrior spirit and comical misunderstanding of human culture. Next time you want another vanilla latte from the coffee shop, try asking for it like an Asgardian. Don’t be surprised if they ask you to clean up your mess, though.\n“Do I look to be in a gaming mood?” (The Avengers, 2012)\nTired of Loki’s tricks and tormenting the newly formed Avengers team, Thor takes him from the quinjet to have a talk, brother to brother. The god of thunder has no time for excuses, urging the trickster to return home before any further destruction is caused.\nHe means business, and isn’t afraid to let Loki know as he knocks him to the dirt before the Avengers return to interrupt their conversation. If someone is acting too carefree while you’re trying to be serious, delivering this line in your best thundering voice should let them know it’s time to be serious. Or that you just really don’t want to play Monopoly.\n“You people are so petty, and tiny.” (The Avengers, 2012)\nUnder the influence of Loki’s staff, the Avengers begin to argue aboard the helicarrier. This quickly devolves into them taking shots at one another as they try to pass off blame for the recent string of escalating events. Thor’s contribution to the argument is to remark on how “petty and tiny” all the mortal heroes are, smirking as he says so.\nCompared to Chris Hemsworth? Yeah, everyone else looks pretty tiny. If you try this one out on a group of squabbling people, it works best if you’re on the taller side. Otherwise, it sounds silly.\n“You’re big. I’ve fought bigger.” (Thor, 2011)\nYes, Thor, we get it! You’re a big guy. Here, fighting in the rain against all of Coulson’s best security guards, the thunder god takes another opportunity to remind those around him of his strength and size. Covered in mud and rainwater he takes the burly guards down one by one.\nNext time you’re in a fight, instead of backing down peacefully, be sure to let your enemy know that they are hardly the biggest, baddest guy you’ve fought. I’m sure that’ll make them scared and definitely not angrier at you for insulting them.\n“You should know that when you betray me, I will kill you.” (Thor: The Dark World, 2013)\nThor never seems to be in a gaming mood when it comes to Loki. Freeing his brother from prison for a secret, highly treasonous mission to Svartalfheim, the thunder god lays out the terms for his trickster brother- no jokes, jests, or lies, or else it’s curtains (or mother’s drapes?) for Loki. Sounds fair enough.\nIf you need to make a deal with someone and need absolute assurance they won’t pull a fast one on you, take a page out of Thor’s book and threaten them with death. It makes your communication clear about what you want, and probably won’t dissuade someone from giving you the help you need. Just be prepared for the follow-through! (I’m kidding, please don’t do this. It’s a bit extreme, even for Thor.)\n“He’s adopted.” (The Avengers, 2012)\nBrotherly love at its finest. After defending Loki from the criticisms of the Avengers, he sternly reminds them that the god of mischief is still his beloved sibling, even though he’s been causing trouble. After Black Widow reminds him of the tally of total damage, Thor quickly adds that Loki is adopted- so destruction and chaos definitely don’t come from Odin’s side of the family.\nNext time someone is trying to blame you for the actions of another, especially a family member, Thor’s quick wit should help clear your name and relation to the culprit- just be prepared to explain in the case that someone has some questions about their frost giant heritage.\n“Jane’s better.” (The Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015)\nThor once again shows his diplomatic abilities in resolving a dispute at the Stark Tower party in Age of Ultron. The argument? Whether Pepper Potts or Jane Foster is better. Of course, Tony and Thor are both biased, and personally I think they should have agreed that both of the women are equally fantastic.\nStill, Thor rounds out the dispute with a quick, “Jane’s better”, as he smirks to himself, putting his eloquence to work once more. I wouldn’t recommend using this one in a daily context, unless you are very specifically arguing about your significant other being awesome. And if their name isn’t Jane, this one might get awkward!\n“Fortunately, I am mighty!” (The Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015)\nBeing mighty solves a lot of problems for Thor, including the problem of mind control- right? Just before Scarlet Witch hexes him, the thunder god declares that his strength can protect him from such trickery. And then, of course, he walks right into a nightmare caused by the woman’s magic. The vision he sees is weird and frightening, but Thor knows his own strength and eventually overcomes her spell.\nThe best of best by the mighty Thor, son of Odin, God of Thunder in Thor: Ragnarok",
      "2": "Owing to some googling prior to answering this, i believe that with the change in director it was also decided that a new direction was the best option for the thor trilogy. Compared to the rest of the movies from the marvel universe, the thor movies have been the weaker link and a new direction was needed to boost its probability of success ( since throughout history the third installment in many movie franchises has paled in comparison to its prequels ). I also think that adding a funnier spin to the new addition to the thor trilogy aided in how it would eventually link up with the guardians of the galaxy in infinity war. All in all i think that making thor funnier then it was in the previous movies gave the characters greater depth, a much needed change as heroes from almost all marvel movies merge in Avengers infinity war.",

      "5": "Well one reason is because Taika Waititi is a really good and funny director. He can bring humor into anything, and Marvel was looking for a new direction and he definitely brought that to Ragnarok."

    "answers": {
      "1": "I'm going anon for this one, simply because I saw somebody from my hometown on here the other day. This event ruined my little town and I'd prefer to not have a name to it. I am not a cop, I am a firefighter, but my partner at the time was an officer, and due to this event he took his life. I am telling this in the hopes it helps others learn from this mistake.\nNew years eve and I was on the 8pm to 8am shift, my partner (I'll call him J) was also working the midnight shift at the station. The fire and police buildings are right next to each other, and being news years eve, each of the stations were having a small get together. The cops came over to one of our empty bays and we were sitting down eating and talking about how much it sucked being on this shift. No alcohol to see the new years in, we always had a high amount of calls due to fireworks being illegally set off and they always had a high number of violence and public nuisance calls.\nOur alarm went off, we jumped up and threw our jackets on before even checking our pager or the eics (emergency information computer service). The boys next door got the same call and we went out code 1 with the police escorting. We arrived on scene, just before midnight. I think it was like quarter to.\nA young woman was standing on the edge of the building. It isn't a massive height, but it doesn't matter. She wouldn't survive if she fell. We all knew it. Crew leader shouted to get the ground covered and the cops started talking to her. J had been handed the job, he told me it was because he was the youngest, that he would be able to relate more to her. She started crying and saying she didn't want to do it, it was a mistake. She just felt so alone that she just wanted it to stop. Then she said that it was too late, she had to do it because she had already done everything she needed too.\nJ started to tell her that it didn't matter if everything was in it's place. She didn't need to do it and they would help her. He started telling her that two people would be going into the building and would meet her at the window to help her down, that she wasn't alone and everybody here was going to support her. No one was here to hurt her. All those really cliché things you hear in movies, but J had a way with people. He could tell you the sky was made just for you and you would believe every word. Every word coming out of his mouth was filled with nothing but love and concern. I loved that man, and even now he's gone, I still miss him.\nThings were going fine, we had been given the access code to the building. The cops had rung ambos and requested ECAT, the young girl had calmed down and was trying to climb back into the window. She tripped and fell backwards, nobody had expected it. She hit the ground and even with the ambo’s working on her for a solid 15 minutes, she was pronounced dead. Coroner was called.\nHere's the bit that messed J up enough that he took his life. When she had told them that she had taken care of everything, she had meant her two children. 3 months and 4 years. They were found dead in their beds, cuddled up to their toys. Photos taken showed them looking like they were simply sleeping. The note they found on the table was begging forgiveness from God for what she had done.\nThe coroner stated that if they had of been found within 15 minutes of us arriving, the 4 year old may have had a small chance of surviving, although serious brain damage would have probably occured.\nJ always blamed himself for not sending a party in the minute they got there. We were evaluated as to why the fire department didn’t have a fall mat. The first responders were suspended and J couldn't live with himself.\nAs much crap as the media and society puts on cops for their mistakes, it doesn't come close the amount of pressure and anger they hold on themselves. I lost J in the autumn of the new year. He would have been 26 in august. This may not be the saddest story here, but it's a story that has ruined a number of families lives.\nThank you.",
      "2": "A few years ago a man was reported missing in our local town. He had gone for a drink with friends, left the pub late that evening, and not gotten home. His wife called us in the small hours.\nIt was about 20th December if I remember correctly.\nHe was found a few hours later. He’d walked by the local river and somehow had slipped in (the bank is very steep and muddy). By the appearance of the skid marks it looks like he managed to swim to the opposite side and tried to climb out, but the water was so cold that exposure took him, and he was found still gripping the guard rail of a small boat moored by the bank.\nHis wife had to be told, and she made the decision not to tell their three children—all aged under 6—until after Christmas, as she wanted them to have one last happy holiday. She knew they would never think of Christmas in the same way again.\nI think it was an extremely brave decision on her part.",
      "3": "I’ve seen a lot of really sad things, way too many than I care to recall. But here’s just one sad story of many.\nA Husband and Wife were having a Birthday party for their daughter. She was little, maybe 4 to 6. I don’t remember exactly how old she was. The mother and daughter and guests were all playing, and eating cake in the living room of their 8th floor apartment. The father had been recently receiving treatment for depression, and went into the kitchen and decided to jump out of the window, to his death.\nThe Mother didn’t notice, until we came up to the apartment and knocked on the door. I saw what was going on, and called her out of the apartment into the hallway. I explained everything that just happened to her, and yes, I didn’t follow protocol and have her make a formal ID of his body. Yes, I did it differently. A picture, the doorman, and his ID, were good enough for me. There’s no way I was going to put this poor woman through any more stress.\nShe asked me about what she should do? How could the situation be handled? I still don’t know if I gave her the right advice. I was a 28 y/o, I wasn’t married, and had no children. I told her to lie to her daughter for now. Not to tell her that her Daddy had died on her birthday by jumping out the window and committing suicide.\nI told her I’d help call the guests’ parents, and have their kids picked up from the party. Then maybe she could tell her daughter that her Daddy wasn’t feeling too well, and went to the hospital. Maybe in the next day or two, she could tell her that her Daddy had died in the hospital of a heart attack.\nThen, when the child was older she could tell her the truth, since family secrets always wind up coming out, anyway.\nI’m not one for lying to people but I just thought that she would always associate her birthday with her father's death, and that just wasn’t fair for this little girl. Unfortunately, death by suicide is still mostly taboo, even in big cities. She and her Mother deserved so much better than the hand they were dealt that day. I still don’t know if this was the right advice, but this is what I would have done for my child, if I’d had one.",
      "4": "Over the years, I’ve seen quite a few things that hurt my heart and a few stick with me 20+ years later. The one I remember the most vividly, especially this time of year:\nIt was Dec 22 - which also happens to be my wedding anniversary. We were in the latter weeks of our academy training and the last half of December they put us with a training officer for some of our field experience.\nAround 7pm we receive a call of a person shot at an apartment complex and arrive at the scene within 5 minutes. My FTO and I are the first to arrive and inside we find a 9 year old boy huddled in the kitchen sobbing. On the floor near him is his father, shot through the chest, with a revolver on the floor nearby. In one bedroom we find his mother, also shot in the chest, but still alive and conscious, calling for her son.\nParamedics arrive and work feverishly on the mother, she remains conscious and calls for her son repeatedly until they wheel her out. Her son is terrified and will not go to her. As the rookie, my job is to stay with the son. Over the next hour or so (until child services arrives) I try to comfort him as best I can and encourage him to see his mom before they take her out (knowing that she is unlikely to make it), but he cries, huddles on the floor in the corner and refuses to move.\nThe detectives and CSI arrive and the facts unfold:\nParents are divorced. Father lives out of state and had come to see his son for Christmas. An argument between the parents ensued with the son present in the bedroom. The husband shoots the wife once in the chest and the son runs into the kitchen and huddles in the corner. Father walks up to son, points the gun, pulls the trigger and nothing happens. Father then points gun at himself, pulls the trigger and fires - he is dead upon our arrival. Examination of the revolver shows spent round (mother), misfire (son), spent round (father). If that doesn’t make one think of a higher power…\nTowards the end of our shift we go by the fire station that responded to the scene. The firemen and paramedics seated in their break area - decorated for Christmas, but sitting mostly in the dark, all visibly upset. When they see us, the station chief simply shakes his head and walks away. One of the paramedics looks up and tells us that they kept her alive until they reached the hospital but the bullet nicked her aorta and she died shortly thereafter.\nWe left the station, turned in our paperwork and went home - that was the first homicide scene in my career and something that I think of every year at my anniversary and hope that young boy has had a better life since that day.",
      "5": "I saw a teenage girl dead in a car accident on a foggy night. Her prom was coming up and the car was full of prom shopping stuff. Her prom dress was lying by her side splattered with blood. The sad part is , she was not even driving. It was her friend who was. The case was identified as an accident where her friend who was one of the drivers had a lapse of judgment and forgot to stop at a STOP sign of an intersection, to be run over by a truck driving at 65–70 miles an hour . The only fatal casualty in this case was this girl sitting, sleeping in the rear. It did not end up well for the other napping passenger in the front as he got paralyzed. The driver got the fewest injuries of the three.\nAs the rookie officer, I had to speak to her parents as well (might sound petty on my part here, but I was so relieved that I did not have to deliver the initial news to them, my FTO did). Visited her place to see her pictures adorn the walls of the house, how much she meant to everyone at high school and among her family and friends made me feel so sad that she left this world way too soon. She was beautiful inside out. The sight of her body dead with the gruesome head injuries and prom dress, books, notepads right next to her smashed bloodied face crushed me and still makes me uncomfortable when I remember it.\nAs my sergeant always says ‘Even one teen dead is way too many’. Absolute shame how a car accident or an OD wrecks the lives of so many families and leaves grieving parents weeping over their children\nBe safe everyone. Drive safely, follow the speed limits, watch the stop/yield sign, don’t answer phone calls, no texts, snapchats, instagrams, watch left, right, very very carefully. Remember, someone out there loves you - YOU HAVE TO LIVE FOR THEIR SAKE! To everyone reading this, vehicles are not a toy or a gadget, they are a privilege - treat them as such!.\nThank you.",
      "6": "Death messages are an unfortunately common part of the job. None are easy but some are simpler, sometimes telling relatives of an elderly person who had been expecting it for ages anyway.\nThe worst I had was a 30 year old man who had died in a car crash on his way home from work. We knocked on his home’s door at about 9pm knowing he would've usually been home about 6. I heard quick footsteps before a young girls voice behind the door shouted “yay daddy’s finally home!” The door was answered by his wife and as soon as she saw me in uniform at the door I could tell she knew what was coming.\nThe mother insisted that she would explain to the children herself and I was selfishly very glad I didn't need to. By far the hardest I've had to try not to show any emotion that time.\n(I've gone anonymous due to some of the work I now do in the police)",
      "7": "Had a 4 year old dying while holding her, crying for her mother who was unconscious in the front seat, all due to a drunk who was pissed off at his girlfriend, and drove into them to show his girlfriend he “wanted to die” (sadly, he walked away with a few scratches and a fractured arm)…his truck was going over 80 at time of impact, little girl’s car was barely at a roll (just started to turn left on a green arrow)\nThey put her picture up at the crash site (bottom of the entrance to highway ), I still can’t pass that picture without remembering her voice, asking her mom to hold her…enough so that I drive up to the next exit so I don’t have to see that smile or hear that voice. She would've turned 18 this past May, and her mother still has memory problems from the traumatic brain injury (mother was in a coma, missed her daughter’s funeral). The mother was sober, was only on the road to pick up her boyfriend, who called because he was too drunk to drive.\nI think out of my entire time as a Police Officer (and earlier as an EMT), that stands out as the worst call I ever handled, and the only time I shed a tear.\nSeeking Jasta",
      "8": "I’ve had countless, especially as a CSI. Most of the calls that I go on involve someone having been shot, stabbed, or beaten to death. Other officers have talked about those types of cases, so I want to throw a different one into the mix.\nThere was an 8 year old boy standing outside of Chick Fil A, trying to sell his prized possession: a teddy bear. He wanted some money so that he could get something to eat, because he had not eaten in three days. His father was a dead beat, and his mother was a crack head that did not take care of her kids.\nNot only did we buy the kid some food, but we obviously got DHR involved. All of the kids are now in foster care and are doing great. Their quality of life dramatically improved. I just hate that so many children are the victims of adult stupidity.\nPhoto courtesy of Google Images",
      "9": "I had not been a police officer but for a few years when as a patrolman one night I was called to an auto accident. I was the second officer on the site when I learned that it was a station wagon filled with 9 cub scouts returning from an event in a town 5 miles down the road. The second car was driven by a drunk driver and he had not a scratch on him. He had been doing at least 90 MPH when he hit a bridge abutment and this caused his car to go airborne up side down. He hit the oncoming station wagon, wind shield to wind shield and the force was so great it literally welded the two cars in to one mass.\nAll of the scouts and the driver of the wagon were killed. We could not identify any body as a single body as they were so mangled and smeared through out the wreck. The drunk walked out of what was left of his car and could not understand what happened. This is the first time I had seen such destruction, and death of so many at one time. I was devastated, and felt like shooting the drunk, but I did not. I just placed him in handcuffs and put him in the back seat of my cruiser. He passed out there.\nHe was later tried and jailed for motor vehicle homicide to the tune of 10 counts each. He was reported to have died in jail some ten years later or so I was told. The accident still is vivid in my mind. Seeing all those blue uniforms, laying on the side of the road waiting for the body bags. We had to literally scrape some of them off the dash and inside of the wagon. I must have thrown up at least 5 times that night. To this day I hate drunk drivers and since I am now retired, still am glad I arrested so many and charged each and every one of them the max that I could. All for those nine little boys and scout leader that died that September night.",
      "10": "Well I wasn't a police officer but an inner city paramedic. And it's actually hard to quantify the saddest thing. I mean I saw one brother shoot and kill another on Christmas Eve because the lights on the tree were blinking. Little kids hit by cars, elderly people hanging themselves I mean the saddest?\nI guess the saddest was seeing a one-year-old baby who was in his mother's arms when his father shot her in the head. He had his mother's blood and brain matter all over him and I don't know if he knew what went on but I imagine that child will never have a normal life.\nIt is absolutely horrible what one human being can do to another. Add in holidays and family members and you get pretty horrific situations. And in the scheme of things all of them are the saddest things you could ever see in your life.",
      "11": "Responding to a report of a possible suicide, I found a mother holding her lifeless 11 year-old child. She was so distraught that she could barely function. He had hung himself with a dress shirt off of the top bunk of set of bunk beds, because the mother had grounded him. I have seen several parents holding their dead children but this one was particularly sad.",
      "12": "I’ve taken a number of kids out of homes on account of unfit parent. That was always sad, because the kids wanted to stay with mom. One mom was taking her six or seven year old with her to score heroin, which she shot up in the car, buying on credit and not paying back, and using the kid as kind of a shield, hoping the dealer wouldn’t kick her ass in front of the kid. Call CPS. The kid was like, “Who’s gonna protect mom if I’m not there?”\nHad another mom, she was a hype - heroin addict and fought it off, got herself mostly clean. Married a good guy, had a couple of little boys, stayed straight for like 8–10 years. Her husband has a good job, upper middle class, pays for everything, she doesn’t have to work, driving a Jaguar, just take care of the boys, it’s all turning out like a picture perfect family. Vacations in Europe and Africa. One day she does some crystal meth, falls right off the deep end. Disappears into the meth culture, which is way worse than the heroin one. Just abandons the family without an explanation. The boys don’t know what’s happened and the husband can’t explain it. She’s on the big slide, got a maggot boyfriend who dies from an OD, she’s stealing stuff from her parents’ house and her old straight friends, who learn fast to cut her out. She used to be pretty good looking but meth takes care of that, and before long she’s a hag. I lost track of her at that point and she’s probably dead now. She had it all and traded it for some rocks and a glass pipe.\nI didn’t meet this kid through my job, but it was pretty sad. My son was about 4th grade and made a friend with this girl and asked if we could give her a ride home. I said okay and tried talking to her and couldn’t get much out of her. Her name and she lived with her grandmother and she’d moved here recently. Other than that, she was dead quiet. My son said she just didn’t talk around grownups but she was okay with kids. We gave her a few more rides over the next few weeks and one day my son says her mom was a murder victim. I got her last name and I remembered the case. Her mom had been into some dope thing and owed or her connections thought she did, so one day they came over to the house and made attempts to collect the unpaid debt. By torture killing mom after tying her and the little girl up. She sat there and watched them work on her mother for an hour or two. The cops came but they were too late for mom. Now she didn’t talk much around grownups. I always wondered what happened to her. Probably something pretty sad.",
      "13": "I’m not a police officer, but I once saw what a police officer saw -at the exact moment. He was having sandwich where I worked. We were talking. Suddenly a car ran a red light and entered the intersection going south at the very moment two cars -traveling East and West- would have passed each other. One car hit the left front, and one car hit the right rear of the red light violator.\nThe hit car, driven by a woman (her sex irrelevant except for what follows), spun like an ‘S’ shaped top. Just as it stopped, the officer and I reached it. Even before we could ask if the woman was alright, she screamed; “My baby! My Baby! My Baby! We saw no baby until we looked in the back seat; I know the cop was choking back screaming as hard as I was for, in the back seat was a baby; part of a baby.\nIn the collision, the baby, laying on the back seat, had been thrown head first towards the back door. Apparently, one hit made the door open and the second -slammed the door closed. The baby’s head stayed between the seat and the closed door. The rest of the baby did not.\nThe woman ran a red light. That’s true. People do this. I’ve done it. I choose not to judge her on this deadly mistake. In my mind, she wasn't even to be harshly judged for what happened to the baby. While true that a car seat would have perhaps saved the body from mutilation, likely a ‘mechanical decapitation’ from the incredible, wham-wham, reversed forces from the impacts would have still occurred. But, this was during those not-so-long-ago days when baby seats were not mandated, and rarely used but, generally were just one more thing easily afforded by those with money, not so much for those who had little or none. A seat belt for such a tiny soul, too, would not have helped. And, finally, she did think safety or she would not have had the baby so tenderly ‘well packed.’ and placed in the back seat.\nPerhaps, in her concern for her child. She had made the mistake of a ‘worrying look back at her.’ ill-advised -to be sure- and fatally-timed definitely leading to her missing the signal. But, this woman received a ‘no-baby Pink' for life, sentence,’ What worse could she have faced?\nI also think that officer and I, as well, received sentences of sorts; as well.\nI do know, as a direct result of what I'd witnessed, I pestered my younger brother -a new driver- to 'please slow down.' He did, too. He stopped his car in the middle of a highway and told me; \"Get out of my car!\" I loved my brother then -and still even though he's gone- and I realized I'd embarrassed him in front of his friends but I never regretted making an attempt to get him to do the right thing. Who knows, maybe just in the time, it took for him to stop and toss me out of that car, a 'fatal' timeline was altered. Life is like that, I think.\nWhether or not this was, at that point, the worst thing this police officer was ever to see, It still is the saddest thing I’ve ever witnessed. But, on that scene, we were both crying, and the screams of that mother live still with me -and I know with him as well, We never saw each other on any occasion after that, that a look of pain wasn’t visible on his face. And, if it wasn’t his pain, I was seeing, it could have only been mine reflected back at me.\nI apologize for the graphic details of this retelling but, if only one person who reads this -who is reminded to watch traffic signals, to secure their children -and themselves- even for a short jog around the block, then that person's momentary revulsion will not be regretted.",
      "14": "As a reserve Deputy Sheriff for the Orange County (California) Sheriff’s Department, I often pulled a shift weekends, holidays, and other occasions so that regular deputies could have more days off with their families without leaving the community short of deputies for needed response.\nWhen I came on shift one Sunday, I was contacted on the radio by the shift Sergeant. He told me to head over to Irvine Lake where they were holding speedboat races and keep an eye on things as they were also selling alcohol and the crowd could get rowdy.\nI pulled into the entrance, waved over someone who looked like he was part of the management crew and told him why I was there. I could hear boats in the background racing on the water. The pitch of the engines would roar up when they took off the line…maintain a roar…then, you could tell when they reached the finish line with a decrease in the roar that became a rumble.\nAs I was sitting there, I heard the roar of a boat for the next race. But, instead of hearing the maintaining roar and the rumble, the sound cut out all of a sudden.\nThe manager guy I had been talking to ran up to my unit about 30 seconds later, out of breath. He said there had been an accident and that a boat had gone out of control, running up onto the shoreline…and, that someone had been hit. I asked where to go and he pointed in a general direction.\nI fired up my patrol car, hit the lights and siren, and followed the road along the shoreline to the area where there were a lot of people gathered. I learned that the boat suffered a structural failure in one of the fins that guided the boat through the water. The failure caused the boat to veer off to the driver’s right, and before he had a chance to cut the engine, the boat had hit the beach.\nA 9-year old girl\nwho was watching the races with her family was hit and cut in half by one of the razor-sharp hulls. The shock of the realization that she was going to be hit was still on her face.\nI learned that the family had been gathered at the lake edge, sitting in lawn chairs to watch the races. When they saw the boat heading towards them, they were all able to get out of the way, except for the girl.\nAfter making notifications to Headquarters via radio, I was examining the scene. I noticed that the boat had come up onto the beach only as far as a small, 6″ high ridge of sand, then hit that ridge, then turned to the left before it came to a stop. That small ridge of sand was able to deflect the entire boat from continuing up the sand and hitting other people.\nI realized that if…if only…the family had set up their chairs above that small ridge of sand, the boat would not have hit anyone…but, would have been deflected.\nThe memory of seeing that little girl’s body and face has been with me ever since. I still find it extremely sad and ironic that a small adjustment in choosing a place to sit could have had a much different outcome.\nAfter that incident, speedboat races at Irvine Lake were banned.",
      "15": "The one that pops into my mind first is the little girl who, out of the blue, told me “See what daddy did to …” then lifted the back of her younger brother's shirt, a toddler, to show his entire back bruised with belt marks.",
      "16": "I was first on scene of a pretty serious accident, some asshat decided to pass a bunch cars in the fog and t-boned a lady who panicked and turned out of the path of this fool. Everybody was injured and one of the cars was on fire. I called for fire and aid and asked for the State Patrol as this was in their jurisdiction. I checked on the lady driver, she was seriously injured but strapped in behind the wheel and secure for the moment. I looked in the backseat and saw a 2 year old laying in the seat, he appeared completely fine but unconscious. I didn't want to move him, and all I could access was his back. I put my hand on his baby-warm back and couldn't feel anything. Paramedics came a moment later and I waved them over to get the little one out and render aid. They walked up and after a brief assessment, they shook their heads and walked away. He was dead.\nI believe that in my adrenalized state, I could not see that he was seriously injured and pinned in the car, all I could see was a baby that needed someone to hold him. I was shaken to the core and sad to this day, the only comfort I have for myself is that I was there, and the little one didn't die alone.",
      "17": "The saddest thing I've ever seen as a police officer was when we responded to a call about an overdose.\nWe arrived to find the victim lying on the ground, not breathing.\nWe did everything we could, but we couldn't save him.\nIt was heartbreaking to see such a young person die like that.",
      "18": "I had to go into a public bathroom to chase out a guy who’d been in one of the stalls an inordinately long time.\nTurned out he was multi-tasking. In addition to defecating, he was shooting up. The needle was still stuck between his fingers. And he’d been dead of an OD for some time. Long enough that there was some lividity.\nSad? Not in the way that a crime victim, particularly a child, is saddening. But I was angered by the stupid, lousy, pointless waste of life.\nNobody’d done this to him. He’d done it to himself. Deprived himself of decades of life. His parents of their child. The rest of his family of a loved one.\nI’d seen OD’s before, but the combination of his youth, and his dying in such an undignified, lonely, almost tragically comical place as a public toilet really got to me.",
      "19": "Not as a police officer, but dispatcher;\nTwo teenagers screaming inconsolably after finding their dad, who had taken his own life. I had heard panic and fear in people’s voices before, but this was the first time I heard pure terror. I could feel the trauma through the phone. I was unable to give them instructions to try and help him in case he could be saved. We hear about trauma’s all the time, after the fact, but it’s very different to be a part of the traumatic event. This happened in 2014, and I still think about them, often.",

Not to tell her that her Daddy had died on her birthday by jumping out the window and committing suicide.\nI told her I’d help call the guests’ parents, and have their kids picked up from the party. Then maybe she could tell her daughter that her Daddy wasn’t feeling too well, and went to the hospital. Maybe in the next day or two, she could tell her that her Daddy had died in the hospital of a heart attack.\nThen, when the child was older she could tell her the truth, since family secrets always wind up coming out, anyway.\nI’m not one for lying to people but I just thought that she would always associate her birthday with her father's death, and that just wasn’t fair for this little girl. Unfortunately, death by suicide is still mostly taboo, even in big cities. She and her Mother deserved so much better than the hand they were dealt that day. I still don’t know if this was the right advice, but this is what I would have done for my child, if I’d had one.",

And this is a police officer who has often told us about horrific and sad events throughout our class periods.\nHe told us a story about a young girl who was convinced to steal liquor from her fathers liquor cabinet, and drive up a mountain to party with two teenage boys.\nShe went up there, and they all started drinking together. They got drunk. They were also out of liquor.\nThe two boys convinced the girl to drive back down the mountain and get back with some more.\nThey convinced this teenage girl to drive drunk down a mountain, in this dangerous awful situation, just for more liquor.\nBut she does it anyway.\nAnd she crashes.\nOut teacher describes listening to her sobbing mother and distraught father beg him to rescue her from the wreckage.\nHer brain is cracked open on the ground. Her brain is out of her head, and now he has to go tell those two parents she is dead.\nThanks to these two boys, a young girl is dead.\nEven with all the awful things our teacher has ever seen, somehow this touched him so profoundly.\nHe said his hatred towards those two boys was more than anything else in his career.\nHe despised how their actions killed this girl.\nWhile describing this story our tough as nails teacher started crying.\nI didn't do this story justice, but I would hope this would be shared so more people can see the consequences of their actions.",
      "23": "It was part of our scientific criminal investigation training. There was about 20 of us who were invited to visit the county coroner’s office to learn how autopsies were performed. We were informed ahead of time that it might be wise if we did not eat much before the class.\nThe visit occurred just a few days after the long four-day Thanksgiving holiday in the USA. During the initial introduction, the morgue technician informed us that we were lucky to be present when the coroner’s office had an unusually large number of bodies waiting to be autopsied. The technician then asked all of us if we knew the reason why that was so. We all thought about it and made some guesses, but they were all incorrect. After we ran out of answers, the morgue technician explained that the reason was because of the Thanksgiving holiday. That’s when so many families, relatives and friends got together to celebrate, then got into arguments, then ended up killing each other. Needless to say, I was both shocked and saddened to learn this.",
      "24": "Great question. There were so many sad moments that unfortunately come with the job. One stands out from the night before Thanksgiving in 1973. A family of five came from out of town to visit friends for the holiday. Since they arrived in the early morning hours they decided to sleep in their car until daylight. A faulty exhaust system leaked carbon monoxide into the car and killed all five - two children and the family dog in the rear seat, and both parents with a baby on the mother's lap in the front. Their friends called us when they couldn't wake them up and the doors were locked. Pretty much ruined the holiday and flashes back on each Thanksgiving ever since.",
      "25": "I have been a police officer for forty years, 28 years on the road of a large city force I’ve seen a lot of death in my time. Some with the person giving their last breath while I was cradling them for comfort.\nI was at a domestic homicide were the girlfriend was stabbed approximately 20 times. I had to attend and document the autopsy the next day. I had no problem seeing the cutting of dead human flesh. I have been to numerous autopsies before this and plenty after. The smell is quite noticible though. You see, like in movies, of the forehead cut and the skin peeled down over the eyes while the assistant uses the cutter to open the skull and pop out the brain.\nThis autopsy was unique. As the pathologist was working on the lower organs he pulled out a small organ and held it in between his two hands. He used a small knife and gently sliced vertically with the utmost care. Using tweezers he reached in and pulled out a foetus. “Look she’s pregnant” He shouted with almost a glee in his voice. I had to turn away at that point and shake my head. I completed my paperwork, finished my shift, drove home and gave my wife the longest hug ever.",
      "26": "I was attending a road traffic accident involving my family members who had an head-on collision with a drunk driver trying to avoid an unladen flat-bed trailer which was parked in the middle of the lane of a two-lane road. It was about 1 In the morning. Fortunately nobody was seriously hurt besides the drunk driver.\nAfter my colleagues arrived on the scene in was tasked to warn traffic approaching to slow down to avoid driving into the back of the articulated flatbed trailer. Being in a very rural and remote location from the nearest city, which was Harare in Zimbabwe, it was important that drivers be stopped prior to navigating through the vehicles and pedestrians of the accident.\nWARNING:\nGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS AHEAD\nNot 15 minutes later, a pickup truck with a white steel canopy approached me at a reasonable speed. It was a pale yellow Peugeot 404 1979 model pickup truck fully laden, even overloaded with people crammed into it. There were 12 people in it as it turned out.\nThe driver saw me wearing my high visibility police uniform and being drunk, accelerated instead of stopping. I jumped onto my motorcycle and chased him to stop him but he was insistent on not bring stopped so tried to run me off the the road. I overtook him and parked up at the accident scene where the other officers tried to stop him, unsuccessfully.\nWe all watched in horror as this driver drove into the back of the trailer at over 70mph. The three people in the front were decapitated, whilst the other eight people in the back were killed. The ninth person who was at the back of all the bodies survived to be admitted to hospital but died a couple days later from his injuries.\nThe indigenous african music in the pickup carried on playing whilst everyone who witnessed the accident stood in total shattered silence. Nobody moved for a good while.\nI had to ride closer to the city to get mobile signal to call an ambulance as the police radio was also out of range. Two hours later it arrived and three people died before the ambulance arrived, leaving just the single survivors who would be buried just a week later.\nI never attended an RTA call again after that.\nUpdate:\nA friend sent me a video clip of a murder. This is now the saddest thing I've ever seen. Two black men walk up to a young white male in a pink polo shirt and gun him down with every round in their 9mm pistols. The primary murderer regards and empties another full clip into the case of the body. I think the victim was killed by the 6th bullet which appeared to have severed the cerebral cortex from the spine. It was broad daylight in a busy car park somewhere in South Africa. It was violent. It was shocking. The victim was unsuspecting and the whole video lasted 18 seconds. Life is fleeting. It never lasts. Don’t cry for the dead, they don't care. Don't cry for the living, they don't care. Cry for those who know they are dying but can be saved by a transplant except donors refuse to give away their organs when they are dead.\nBang!",
      "27": "Not as a police officer, but the worst I have seen a cop have to do:\nChristmas morning at 2:30 am in 1981, I got up to see which one of my friends was knocking on my front door. It was an old friend on the Police force that told me my brother had shot himself and needed to get over to Dad’s as he was taking it awfully hard. The cop was one of dad’s hunting and fishing buddies and probably things I don’t know about from is youth. Fortunately, for my 9 year old son we had done almost all the Christmas things on Christmas Eve.\nEveryone one else got over it better than I did. My brother and I were close, and holidays were blood sports between mother and her mother. From that point on, Christmas has been the low point of the year for me.\nI can still remember the pain in the cop’s voice.",
      "28": "Not not a cop but\n2 different stories\nEarly to mid 80s, heading home after a car club event on a Sunday, in reasonably heavy rain, in reasonably heavy traffic a car full of young Air Force guys were on the back road from the local air force base, only a few miles south, to merge with the main road I was on, heading north. The back road paralleled the main road for perhaps a mile or do before merging .( a lot of these young guys had money, thought they were tom cruise from top gun, and regularly drove like they thought they should I think the expression is “young, dumb, and full of c..”\nIn the last short while before the back road merged with the main rd( great south road, how original) I became aware of a mustard coloured Japanese car travelling probably at least half as fast again as the traffic on the main road, so started to ease off the gas. The early 70s jappa did not even slow down, it belted out onto the main road at an angle to the traffic, so that it tapped one car, about 5 or 6 ahead of me, and started to spin, at high speed.\nBeing as tinny and light as it was, the car deformed instantly and as it spun, started to lose pieces, the glass all exploded, Windows and screens, headlights and tail lights, I think during this it probably got tappedby one of the following vehicles again, but I am unsure., it just kept spinning at crazy high speed . The exploding glass and plastic was like trying to see in a hail storm.\nAs it spun, beyond losing all the exploding glass, the doors flew open, the boot lid popped, and anything inside not strapped in flew out. There were more people in the car than should have been, so obviously some/ all not wearing seatbelts….\nEach time it spun, more came out…\nOne that came out was clipped by a following car, became airborne and seemed to hang there for long time ( obviously not in reality) before landing on the windscreen of the car ahead of me. ..\nI'm sorry, I'm bad, I'm still glad it wasn't on my car, not because it was my car, but because I would not have liked to deal with that, what I saw was bad enough.\nThere was debris… of all sorts… everywhere\nI pulled over even though there was nothing I could do…\nAs I drove this road every day, I passed back heading south the next morning. I could not believe the extent of the debris field, despite a clean up and the vehicle having been removed, the debris extended grossly beyond the road both directions on a very wide section of roading, and over z distance of mire tha a mile, possibly skme of this was due to being moved by vehicles and weather\nBut\nA very sobering experience\nMid 90s\nI had a retail business. I was reasonably well known by locals and was generally the person who people came to if they locked their keys in their car, (there was a rumour I used to know how to open locked cars) or when someone jumped in the river in a suicide attempt, or someone had an accident, or a heart attack or….car accident ùor….\nOn this particular day I heard a bang, and thought minor prang, I'll make sure everyone is ok..\nI let the shop staff know i was heading out and took off down the street\nAn elderly man had been driving home, from his hospital visit, felt unwell and decided to pull in to the side of the road, and I think clipped another car slightly\nHe was looking totally out of it and not really aware of what was going on when I got there, sitting in the drivers seat, having suffered an internal haemorrhage, which basically meant he had projectile/explosive vomited copious amounts of blood over the interior of his car. At this time his head was not working, and he struggled to get out of his car. I could not reason with him, and as I would not physically stop him, I caught him as he collapsed down the side of his car and laid him in the recovery position, tried to talk to him but could get no response, he was still losing a little blood, but based on the volume I could see it did not look good. I had carried a cordless work phone( remember the old bricks) from work which had an amazing range and called emergency services, ambulance, who actually turned up amazingly quickly, (although it is literally minutes to the hospital from there, so should be fast but that was not my experience )\nI explained who I was( local pharmacist, from the pharmacy they could see) what I had seen, and what I surmised, and that if he had any chance they needed to be very fast, and they were\nWe had a huge audience which I always feel is disrespectful and unnecessary, so as my part was finished, I asked a couple of young guys from local businesses i knew, to bring buckets of water and a broom to clean up and remove the mess, which they disappeared to do.\nAs the guys were coming back with their buckets of water, the first police car turned up, and absolutely spewed at them, I stepped in and said hey, I said to do this, there is a mess and it needs cleaning up\nHe had a major spew at me, what did I know, i did not Know anything, it's a crime scene…. Spew spew spew.\nI went whoa, sorry I'm not trying to do anything wrong, just get rid of this mess. I said who I was, where I was from\nIt's not a crime scene , it's a medical issue…. And explained…\nI was not appreciated !.. at alģl…\nI said I'll leave this to you, you know where to find me if you want me. By this time other police cars had turned up, some of whom knew me. I apologised to the guys with buckets of water and thanked them. I kept an eye on things throughout the day, and asked if they had heard anything about the guy, to no avail. At the end of the day , the police organised a council water blaster to clean the road, so I approached the last police officer there to find out what was known. By this time the police had found out that the man had left his hospital appointment, to drive home, the hospital and he were aware of his condition. He had haemhoraged inside his car as he pulled over, but not off the road, he had not survived the day.\nI asked what happened next, and was asked what did I mean.\nI said what happens with the car. He explained that the family would be notified, and they could collect the car\nI couldn't believe it. I said have you seen the car, he looked at me like I was stupid, yes it's right here.\nI said no, look inside.\nI said you can not do this to a family, they have just lost husband, dad, granddad… they may know how he went, hopefully not, they certainly don't need to forcibly see how he went, you cant do this.\nAt this point he got the council guy to clean the outside if the car . I waited and said that was nothing, open the door ,\nI said if it's flooded it will be a write off, they don't need to see it…. Do they…\nThe cop had a quick look, looked a little green,looked at the council guy already in his protective gear and nodded\nI did not save anyone's life that day (BUT i have on other occasions)\nBut although the family will never know, I did what little I could to make a bad day not as terrible as it could have been",
      "29": "The one incident that haunts me still, occurred when I was a new captain on the graveyard shift. I was just leaving the station and the dispatcher sent a unit for an accident with the car upside down in a drainage ditch. The drainage ditches in my city were typically 8–10 feet deep, and filled with water after heavy rains. This ditch was full of water. I was close, so I headed for the scene, I was the first unit at the scene and I saw a car upside down, submerged in the filthy water. There was a young lady who was screaming that her friend was in the car. My first thought was “Where’s a rookie when you need one!” Followed immediately by “Captains ain’t supposed to do this shit!” I was still the only officer on the scene, so I peeled off my gun belt and body armor and went into the ditch. Air temp was about 60 degrees and the water was frigid. I was able to reach into the car, and could feel the trapped person, but she was stuck in the car, maybe by her safety belt. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to extricate her from the car. About 30 minutes later, a wrecker was able to pull the car from the ditch and paramedics were able to free her. Unfortunately, she had drowned.\nFor a long time I blamed myself for her death, even knowing that if I had been able to get her out of the car, she was probably dead before I got there. The young lady driver, later sued the city for having an unsafe roadway because of the deep drainage ditch which was not fenced or otherwise barricaded despite a 4 track railroad crossing shortly before she left the roadway. I later learned the two ladies were high school seniors who had been to a graduation party. The driver confessed to having a drink, and blood test showed BAC (blood alcohol content) less than 0.02%.\nYears later, the case went to trial, and I was called as a witness for the city. As I testified about my efforts to try to rescue the young lady, the driver/plaintiff began sobbing. I got choked up just reliving the experience, and had to pause to wipe my eyes and recompose myself. To this day, I still think about that young lady who I wasn’t able to save and wonder what else I could have done to save her life. I even talked to the on scene paramedics and the medical examiner to see if they thought I could have saved her if I had been able to remove her from the car. Their opinions were that she had drowned before I even got to the scene. Didn’t help then, doesn’t help now.",

A father was backing out of the driveway unaware that his son had ridden his tricycle behind him. He ran over and killed his child. Another time he had gotten a call to this residence for a domestic disturbance call. The man was long gone but the woman was in the floor her throat slit, she begged my father to save her. He tried to hold the artery closed until help arrived. She died with his hands covered in her blood. He never really got over that one.",
      "31": "I don’t know if this counts because I was not a police officer, I was an investigator for a State Attorney General and although what I saw was very sad I couldn’t fully appreciate how tragic it was at the time.\nThis was long ago. I had to interview a doctor who was obviously guilty of large-scale medicaid fraud. For a long time neither the federal gov’t. nor state administrators were making even a token effort to combat medicaid fraud and the providers knew it. Minor bilking wasn’t very unusual and a few predators went hog wild.\nWhen the authorities finally started taking the matter seriously and conducting criminal investigations the first subjects were the hog-wild blatant crooks. The amounts they billed and the work they reported were impossible right on their face. We knew they were crooks before we even left the office.\nI had an appointment with a surprisingly old doctor (I was about 25 at the time, he looked like he could have been my grandfather). He agreed to speak to me without a lawyer present even though I’d given him something similar to a Miranda warning (he hadn’t been indicted yet so a full-blown Miranda wasn’t necessary). He was relaxed. He recently had a dispute with a patient he refused to continue treating because of multiple missed appointments. She complained to the medical board and he thought I was there in regard to her complaint.\nWhen he realized my focus was his obviously fraudulent billings he began sputtering, shaking, blaming everything on a former bookkeeper (current whereabouts unknown; I doubt she existed) and generally claiming the “mistakes” were innocent clerical errors, all of which—entirely coincidentally—put money into his pocket. His hands and knees were trembling , his stomach bobbed up & down. He knew his life was taking a big turn for the worse. He was probably in his 70’s. Probably a pillar of the community and probably had never been in serious trouble before. He not only stopped making eye-contact, he wouldn’t even look in my general direction. He invoked his right to remain silent. He wanted a lawyer.\nI was glad to leave. I didn’t want to watch him meltdown. He stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from a program designed to help poor people even though he could honestly earn an upper-middle class income working part-time. I don’t know why he did it. I didn’t have to, it wasn’t relevant.\nI didn’t know what to make of him. He didn’t radiate evil. I thought he was too old to to have a drug habit or an expensive mistress (I only thought that way because I was too young to know better). Maybe I was overthinking it—maybe it was just garden variety greed inflamed by a system which made stealing irresistibly easy.\nWhat I was most struck by was that he was a doctor—he couldn’t be stupid— so he had to know if anyone took a hard look at his medicaid claims it would jump off the page that he was a crook. A psychologist might say he wanted to get caught. Maybe at some level he did but on the surface he didn’t seem very happy about it.\nTwo weeks later I found out that a few days after our meeting he committed suicide. In hindsight his behavior was the most pathetic thing I’ve ever seen.\nA few months after that I got another job in an entirely different field.",

People don’t realize how dangerous a dry Christmas tree is - they are filled with pine sap and turpentine and when they go up, it’s like a bomb.

Over a 2 week period, my partner and I got the code 3 roll on 5 or 6 baby not breathing calls. All of them were around 4 or 5 in the morning. The parents had woken up for work, gone in to check on the babies and found them not breathing. All of them had died in their sleep. On the last one, the parents were sitting, holding each other, staring at me as I looked at their baby. I couldn't bring myself to tell another pair of parents that their baby was dead, so I started giving him CPR. I preferred putting my lips on a dead baby's lips to that. So I did that for the 5 minutes or so, until the paramedics arrived and told the parents.\nSo aside from the obvious sadness of all these dead babies, my partners baby had died in its sleep just a year, or two before, so it was hard on him too.

      "36": "I was working on a Sunday, the day shift, during the summertime in Boulder, Colorado, as a traffic officer. The department had set up a special traffic program to spot and ticket hazardous drivers, the program was called S.T.E.P. Selective Traffic Enforcement Program.\nI was not supposed to handle traffic accidents, just stay busy with ticketing, but this day, all the officers were busy so when dispatch asked for a cover car to assist in a possible injury accident at Broadway and College (The Hill), I volunteered and off I went with lights and siren. By the time I had arrived, the primary officer was already there and was being assisted by the University of Colorado Police Department.\nI could see an RTD bus parked at the curb, southbound, of the intersection of College and Broadway and gouge marks in the pavement of the roadway, trailing from under the bus, leading back to the north a good 150″ or so in the curb lane of Broadway. Closer inspection of the gouge marks disclosed pieces of black leather, human skin, blood, and bone. To make a horrendous story short and to the point, a motorcyclist had pulled out in front of the bus, the bus could not stop, the cycle with driver had gone beneath the bus and was dragged the 150′ to the current resting place at Broadway and College and the cycle and rider were still under the bus.\nThis was no small bus but a full-size, city service bus. It took one of those large wreckers that deal with such large vehicles to lift the bus up on its side a bit so the fire department could dislodge the body of the rider and the cycle could be pulled from beneath the bus. It had been a most delicate operation to disentangle the human from the machine but I was not to find out how bad it was until a little later.\nOnce the body was on the way to the emergency room, I followed in the patrol car because the investigation still did not have his name or know anything about him. The next thing was to start taking pictures of the body in the emergency room, find his ID, see if I could identify him from his driver’s license photo with the body we had on the gurney and then notify the coroner investigator, who would notify the victim’s family.\nI parked my patrol unit and followed the body into the ER and into the procedure room. There I observed that the body was so badly mangled you could hardly tell it was a human. There was a head and shoulders with some clothing, but the torso was nearly torn from the upper half; I won’t go into anything further as it does no one any good because I think you all have the tragedy that lay there on the gurney.\nThe nurses draped the body the best they could…and pushed the remains into a side room for me to begin taking photos. I did so and I found his wallet and ID. The ID photo matched the face of the dead man next to me. There was no doubt concerning who he was in my mind. I now had to wait on the coroner’s investigator to come to the ER and take over so he or she could notify the family. I would most likely go along, but death notifications were usually left to the Coroner’s Office. That was the plan anyway….\nAs things sometimes happen, a neighbor of the accident victim had happened to go by the accident scene and saw the remains of the motorcycle and knew who it belonged to. The neighbor got in touch with the victim’s parents.\nAs I awaited the coroner’s investigator, all Hell suddenly broke loose in the waiting room of the emergency room.\nHospital security officers were on the way to quell the disturbance but I was right there so I stepped out and tried to quiet everyone. This gentleman, a little larger than me, angry and glaring, yelled at me and said, “I WANT TO SEE MY SON!!”\nTrying to quiet him, I asked his name and when he told me, I swallowed my heart. The poor man’s face was fire engine red and I tried to get him and his distraught wife to come to another room but he wasn’t moving. I finally had to say to him, “Sir…your son was killed in a traffic accident.”\nA deep roar and then a shrill scream came from his lungs and he lunged at me, striking me three times on my shoulders with his clenched fists in utter and unrestrained rage and frustration at the man who had just ruined his life…I felt terrible for him. I did not restrain him, I did not flinch from the beating, I did not defend myself….when he realized what he had done, he fell to the floor, a fallen and destroyed man…his wife joined him there in such sadness that I can barely write about it to this day….\nSince then, I have seen other sadness, the tears of so many over the years, but my heart shall always be etched with the tears that this man shed and my mind still echoes with his terrible scream.",
      "37": "My partner and I responded to a T/C that had just occurred in the Harbor. It was about 2030 hours, dark, but clear and dry. A crowd had already started to gather and we quickly exited to assess the situation. As we began making requests for additional patrol units, a rescue ambulance, and traffic officers, we also realized we'd have to contact the coroner. Here's the basic story... There were three vehicles in total; mini-van with father driving, mom sitting front passenger and 16 y.o. daughter sitting rear passenger; 19 y.o. son (of van occupants) following in compact car; V-3, sedan with one male driver. V-1 and V-2 were waiting in the left turn pocket to make a turn. Dad decided he could make it and accelerated into the intersection. V-3, travelling in the opposite direction t-boned the van at full speed (approx 40 mph) sending it spinning into the son's car behind them (V-2). All vehicles came to rest and the occupants began to exit, obviously shaken, but not seriously injured. Dad, mom, son, 3rd party driver...all able to walk, but... The 16 y.o. daughter wasn't out with the rest of the family. When the van was t-boned, the impact struck the exact spot where the daughter was sitting, killing her instantly. She sat, still seatbelted in but deceased with her jaw literally hanging from her face. As the coroner arrived to remove the young girl, additional information came to light. Apparently, the reason the dad/family were in such a hurry was because they had received a phone call from the local hospital that the grandmother (dad's mom) was on her deathbed. To add insult to injury, the 16 y.o. had celebrated her \"sweet 16\" just 24 hours prior. This fact was apparent by the shiny gold \"Sweet 16\" charm around her neck. It was the most unfortunate of accidents, yet it was just that...an accident. Hours later I discovered that the grandmother they were all rushing to visit one last time, had passed away only 15 minutes before their horrific crash. I could only hope and pray that somewhere out there, a grandmother and her grand daugthter were together once again, neither feeling the pain of the world they left behind.",
      "38": "Not my story, my biological dad was a police officer and this was one of his stories, it also involves our family so I will change names for confidentiality. So this story took place 2 months before I was born but he told me and my mom helped me refresh my memory of the story. Our area used to have a law (I don’t know if it’s still in place or not) that if a police officer responded before rescue personnel and found the victim unresponsive they had to do life sustaining measures until rescue personnel arrived. My dad was called to respond to an unknown type rescue of a 2 year old girl, he recognized the address as my aunt’s and immediately responded (there was probably some rule against it because it was family but he went any way) he was first to arrive on scene and found my 2 year old cousin Breanna dead in her living room, her mother shaking her yelling for her to wake up. My dad immediately started CPR but it was too late. My aunt watched him break Breanna’s ribs and breast bone doing CPR and then had to be told that it was all for nothing, that she was dead some 10 minutes latter by paramedics. My dad was devastated and took his life 3 years ago due to the phycological trauma of being a police officer. He left my mom with me and 5 other kids alone, she remarried but I miss him SO MUCH!

      "39": "While I have encountered countless traffic collisions, personal tragedies, street shootings, and other heart-wrenching incidents, I must say, the saddest thing I have witnessed as a cop, to date, is the lack of respect for our constitution, and our society, today.\nHaving served with the USMC Infantry in Iraq, as a patrol officer for a decade, and now as a full-time SWAT team operator, I hope I am qualified to speak on human tragedy. However, of all the individual suffering I have witnessed, I never imagined a world where my country, my flag, my profession, and the sheer scope of sacrifice I have witnessed from my peers, would be looked down upon with such distain.\nIn fact, it is having witnessed all that human tragedy, I believe, that gives me such a unique perspective on our society, its laws, our constitution, and just how that translates into our way of life. I have buried brother-in-arms; I have cried at countless police memorials; I have watched as my daughter screamed and cried, believing I was walking out the door into another mob of angry protesters; I have watched as officers held now-parentless children to their chest, in a moment of true empathy and human understanding; I have watched my brothers and sisters charge into gunfire, on the off chance a another human could still be saved. And through all of it, I never questioned, “Why?”. I never found cause to hesitate, or to wonder, why it is, or how it is, we have so many selfless people doing so many difficult jobs. I never had to wonder if what I was doing was even helping.\nWell, those days are gone. I see a country that has forgotten its roots. I see a country that has forgotten what our ways have created; The most prosperous, free people the world has ever known. I see people in the street, with no knowledge of our constitution or its value. I see pundits on television, actively working against the cornerstones of our republic. I see police officers, devoid of any human emotion, showing how little they deserve their badge, all over You-Tube; And worst of all, I see my peers and the look on their face as they realize their years of personal sacrifice may have been in vain.\nSo, although I have responded to the non-breathing children, and the teenager murdered on the sidewalk, and while those incidents are horrible, I have never seen anything as awful as the disintegration of our society. While I have seen a mother crying, I have never seen an entire society rip itself apart. While I have seen a corrupt cop walking away in handcuffs, after violating everything his badge represents, I have never witnessed the contempt and hate I see now for the foundations of the greatest nation on earth.\nIt bring me great pain to see my fellow Americans in this state. And the pain is punctuated by the look on the faces of those that have chosen to serve our flag, only to discover that, in many cases, they are not wanted.\nSo, in answer to your question, the most tragic thing I have ever seen as an officer is the news yesterday, regardless of who’s fault it is.",
      "40": "I’m a police officer in a smaller sized northern EU city.\nWe once raided a basement where drug addicts and thieves had taken up camp. This was late December right before Christmas some years ago.\nWhile rounding the intruders up I found a young female there who has a history with the department for drugs, breaking and entering, petty thefts etc. I know she has a kid that’s in foster care that she gets to see when she’s clean. This day she was sleeping naked, high on drugs, on a blanket in the corner of a concrete cellar room together with some others.\nSince the company that owned the house wanted the people out of there we told everyone to start packing. Someone was arrested for receiving stolen property and possession of a large knife that he came up to the door with when we entered. Another one had the equivalent to warrants and was also brought in. Ultimately it was just me and her in this run down basement room.\nIt took a while for me (being male) allowing her to get dressed under decent circumstances and gathering her things. When I searched one of her bags for illegal substances, weapons and stolen property I found a doll, some Christmas candy and some small LEGO-sets. Obvious Christmas presents.\nI’d say the total worth of it all was no more than 50 dollars (or euro). I understood right away that the items we’re stolen (price tags and theft protection still on it etc) and that I was expected to seize the stolen property and report her for the appropriate crimes, however it would’ve been very hard to trace the source / store it was stolen from and when etc.\nI see her noticing me finding the stolen items after I have previously asked her if there are any stolen property, guns, knives, bazookas or drugs in her bags to which she answered no.\nPutting the presents and candy back in the bag I told her that I hoped she would get to see her kid during Christmas and that she would not be reported for unlawfully being in the basement because the property owner didn’t want to press charges.\nShe cried, wishes me a merry Christmas, said thank you and left.\nLater I heard she had managed to stay clean(ish) and spent the holidays at the foster family.\nI look back at this situation from time to time as one of the more sad things I’ve encountered during my career so far.\nEven though one would assume going to peoples homes and telling them a family member has been killed in an accident or other such calls would stay with me more than letting someone keep some stolen property it really hasn’t.\nI don’t know why, but have no regrets.",

      "42": "Ive answered a few of these questions on here before. I think a different story every time. (I forget most of what ive seen, then sometimes out of the blue ill remember something).\nSo Ill save my own stories for the next time I answer one of these. This is something I didnt witness, just know about.\nChristmas day, years and years ago, cops get a call to a family fight. (Always on the holidays). The house was a repeat customer. First cop gets there, ends up getting his ass kicked by two people at the house. Hes calling for help on the radio.\nCops come from all over the city. Two cop cars approach intersection (lights and sirens on). First cop clears the intersection and continues. Second cop, not too far behind, doesnt clear it.\nA second car (not involved), with the green light, drives out into the intersection (with the right of way). Second cop car T bones them. Kills two teenage (maybe early 20s) sisters on their way to christmas morning.\nTalk about devestation. Completely ruined family. Who will now remember it every christmas.\nThe first cop who was getting his ass kicked was one of my academy instructors. He told us the story, and the learning point was obviously clear your intersections (and dont approach fight calls alone).\nHe brought in the cop who had crashed and killed the two kids. This was maybe 20 years after the event. That cop talked to us again about safe driving, but also how to deal with the job stresses. He had become a PTSD counselor for cops and fire as a second job.\nSo, all in all, a very sad story. But at least there was somewhat of a silver lining? Guy becomes a grief counselor? Turned a horrible event into something good.\nFast forward a few years. Cop who caused the crash retires. Makes it through his entire 30 year career. Went on to help thousands of people, even more with his side job. Yadda yadda yadda.\nDay after he retired (from what I remember), he went to the grave of the two girls he killed, and committed suicide.\nObviously the two dead kids are the sad part from this story. Who knows what the world was robbed of when they were killed.\nBut the copper carried that with him for close to 3 decades.",
      "43": "Many years ago, when I was a Police Officer, on Christmas morning, a call came in of an unexpected death. When I attended, the husband had been to church, left his wife in bed asleep, but on his return found her lifeless in the bedroom. Naturally he was distraught, as anyone would be.\nI attended the house, and with sympathy and understanding, took all the necessary details , including on call undertakers, etc., all of which takes about two hours to sort out. Just I was about to leave,, the man said to me, with all sincerity, “I hope you have a better Christmas Day than I shall have ”.\nI know we should have control of our emotions, but at that moment my eyes welled up with sadness, at his loss and his genuine feelings for me as a person.\nI thanked him, shook his hand. and left the house.\nIt transpired that his wife had a massive heart attack.\nTruly a remarkable man.",
      "44": "I participated in canvassing a neighborhood for witnesses following a report that a young mother and her child were stabbed in their home and transported to the hospital. There was a lot of blood in the home, which was taped off. They were not expected to live.\nI was outside the home when the father arrived. He was not given information, and immediately became emotional as one would expect. I was instructed to drive him to the homicide investigators. Under such circumstances we did not talk to the people we brought to the investigators; neither did we read them their rights. The investigators wanted a first crack at that. The emotional reaction to news of the death is important, and the investigators were far more skilled at obtaining Miranda waivers than anyone else.\nI learned before taking the man to the PAB that the wife and child died. He begged me to tell him if they were dead. I was required to lie by telling him I did not know. For the 15 or so minutes I drove, he begged, prayed and cried. I said nothing other than that I was sure everything would be fine. I hated doing so, but I did now know what he actually knew or if he was a suspect.\nHis reactions were those of an innocent person I could not comfort or help. The wife was killed by a neighbor teen who was caught stealing the family piggy bank by her. The child was a witness, so she, too, was killed. The teen wanted a few bucks for crack.",
      "45": "I’m not a police officer, but I will tell this tale on behalf of a police officer who has almost surely gone on to the next world.\nIn the winter of 1964 I was 22 and on my first real job as a newspaper reporter in a small New Mexico town. There was a state university in the town with about 4500 students. Just before Christmas break, four girls from the university were returning by car from a shopping trip to a nearby city. The terrain was flat as a table top, with scrub brush and bear grass. One could see for miles. A major railroad line lay between the town and the city and through freight trains roared past the crossing at 70 mph. You could see them coming for more than a mile and hear their whistles. Somehow the girls in their car managed to get hit by that train. Maybe they were laughing and talking and didn’t notice the train. Maybe they thought they could make it across the tracks in time. The train hit the car and knocked it flying end over end until it landed 40 to 50 yards from the highway. The local State Police officer was scrambled to the scene and someone called the newspaper editor who sent me to the hospital where the four girls had been taken. Three of the girls were DOA and the small town doctors were trying to save the fourth girl, but she died on the table. I knew the State Police officer pretty well, as I saw him almost daily on my news beat and he and I had established a good relationship. He stood outside the emergency room shaking with emotion with tears streaming down his face. He told me that when he got to the wrecked car, he knew right away three of the girls were already dead. The fourth girl, the driver, was sitting behind the wheel, screaming over and over and over. She was the one taken to the hospital. “She was screaming and screaming and I couldn’t do anything for her,” the cop sobbed. I put my arm around him and tried to console him but he was beyond that. I finally got a nurse attention and she led the officer away, where I hope they gave him something to knock him out. Later the doctors told me there wasn’t a mark on the body of the girl who died in the hospital. But surely her internal organs and/or her brain must have been damaged by impact and subsequent cartwheeling of the car. The girl who was screaming was from New York state. Why she had chosen to go to college in New Mexico thousands of miles from her home I never learned. But imagine how her parents must have felt when they learned their daughter had died in that wreck less than two weeks before Christmas. The officer regained his composure and he and I remained friends until I moved away to work for The Associated Press.",
      "46": "Okay, I am not a police officer but I wanted to share this story anyway. The year was around 1980. Back then cruising was still a popular pastime for teenagers on Fri and Sat nights. You’d pile your friends into a car or truck and drive around a certain part of town. And there was a couple of burger joints where kids would park and just hang out. Just imagine American Graffiti 25 years later. Anyway this one kid had a small pickup, like a Toyota or Ford Courier. Small trucks were pretty small back then. Anyway he had like 8 or 9 of his friends in the bed and one or two in the cab. It was legal to ride in the bed of a pickup back then. So he’s driving them around and he’s going a little too fast. He makes a turn. No stop sign but no cars coming so he just goes. Well 10 passengers is a lot of weight, and concentrated up high. Plus maybe the shock were worn. So the truck just rolls over right in the middle of the road. All 10 of his passengers died. He survived. A friend of mine was one of several gathered bystanders that the police called over to help them lift the truck. Several people were trapped under it. My friend told me that where he was positioned, ready to lift, a girls bloody hand was sticking out from under the box. I think the cab was partly collapsed too. I didn’t know any of the kids; just recall the incident and the newspaper article the next day. I never heard what became of the driver. I would guess he either found the lord or ate a bullet. I do not know how anyone could deal with the guilt. 37 years ago and I still shudder thinking about that wreck.",

The 9 year old as she explained how her 18 yr old brother was abusing her. The 17 year old asthmatic who died as we rushed her to hospital these calls we did and the general public dont hear of them but it is a cruel world out there and your Police officer has to deal with it.",

The only way to deal with an affair successfully is to break it off and for him to NEVER I repeat NEVER see her again less he backslide.\nI personally will add. If he is not willing to do this immediately, he is making a choice and he is not choosing you. Instead he is saying what he has to so the he can keep both. There is no remorse from him. You can tell because he is not changing his behavior. Infidelity is a legitimate reason to leave. If he won't choose you now, then even though it is hard you should leave.

A person who's a cheater..should not be giving you ultimatums…you deserve better..go find yourself a man who will truly appreciate you …and work on your “ self esteem”",
      "23": "Why do you think he gets to decide what your life will be? You can decide what you want and if he doesn’t want to be faithful then you file for divorce.",
      "24": "Two years? What are you still doing with him? I would never sit tight and wait 2 years for a man to decide if he wants me. You have the ability to make your own decision, is this how you want to spend the rest of your life?",
      "25": "Oh he has already made his decision, and that is to stay in it!!! Now it’s time for you to make your decision to no longer be a part of that!!! You are worth way more than how he is treating you.\nPack your bags and leave now and remember this, if you can’t be the only one in the relationship with your man, then you don’t need to be in it at all!!!",
      "26": "Two years? You should realize he’s got it made. With the affair he’s got a fun relationship with none of the daily baggage and work of a marriage. But he’s also got you and the marriage that supply a base and stability. Also, divorces are hard and might impact him financially in a negative way. So he just keeps on… and on… you are enabling it in some ways. You must pull yourself together and see a therapist. Figure out EXACTLY what the finances are and see an attorney. Good luck. And it may be hard to believe, but there are some wonderful men out there. And also living alone and building your own life and self esteem would be hard at first but SO WORTH IT.",
      "27": "Give yourself some time to pack your bags and leave him. Never make children with a guy like that. The moment you die the husband will look for his next wife. Don’t put your children through that kind of experience.",

If they are a bad actor once, that is who they are. You need to decide if you want to give them another chance, but realize that it just might be better for your safety and mental health to get out while you can, and move on.",
      "29": "My ex-husband told me the same thing when he just got caught. I was the one who being patient. But the thing is he wanted to keep the both and told the same things to another girl. I was being patient and thought he will choose me but it got worse. He took granted all my forgiveness and in the end he told me he wanted the polyamory relationship. It was only a month after marriage. I asked him if he can put me priority than his desire and pleasure and the thing you do is not being honest and it’s rude but he exactly told me this\n“Do you want me to be honest and tell you who i’m gonna be with or want me to lie and hide all the things? I put you always priority and i’m trying to be honest to you cuz I love you. “\nYour husband doesn’t give a shxt about what your going through and his feelings and desire are more important. He doesn’t care you going through a hard time or having a physical and mental pain because of his action. I think it’s time to show your husband that you are the person who can leave whenever you want when he doesn’t respect you. Don’t ever put you in that situation.

He wants to have his cake and eat it too.\nIf you didn’t sign up for polygamy, then he has broken the sacred vow between you. On top of that, he wants you to be patient?!? He can fuck off as far as I’m concerned.\nHave respect for yourself or others won’t respect you. It’s time to let your inner bitch OUT! Every person has it in them. Channel it. Lawyer up, protect yourself, and tell him to kick rocks. If I were your friend I would’ve helped you put a stop to this a long time ago. I’m guessing he doesn’t have any male friends worth a shit or they would’ve told him by now.\nIt’s gone on this far, but no further. The line must be drawn. Let him have his affair lady.

Or do you want to see what your options are, what resources you have, and make a decision that is in YOUR best interest?\nWhat do YOU want for YOUR life?

You deserve so much better.",
      "36": "Why are you wasting your time waiting for HIM to decide? He has already shown he does not respect you enough, otherwise he would not have asked this of you. It is best if you make up your mind to leave. Start making yourself self sufficient and give him the boot. He doesnt deserve you and you deserve better….. a person in whose life you are No. 1.",
      "37": "Make the decision for him. Choose you. If he can’t choose between you and another person, then trust and believe, he’s made a choice… both of you… as long as you both allow it. So, unless you are up to “sister wives” living: choose you and move on with your life. It’ll hurt, but will it hurt as much as it’s hurting now? Staying in it will be constant hurt and moving on will be move towards healing. You are worthy, fearfully and wonderfully made, you deserve nothing but the best, you are not an option… you are the choice. The right man will know this.",
      "38": "Do you have friends? Be with them. I'm a believer in sticking together during hard times but this is not a hard time! He's exploiting your love, and marriage. He's killing the legitimacy of vows themselves! And he probably is the reason you have no respect for yourself! You are NOT vow bound at this point! The deal is he has to be an honorable husband . Go to a friend's and divorce that jerk. Be patient!!!??? Fuck him? You need help to get out of there.",
      "39": "My mother dealt with the same thing with my father. She kept choosing him over our family after he kept cheating. Then everyone suffered.. You’re a woman. You can easily find a man who will respect you and won’t cheat on you. You don’t deserve this unless you keep allowing it. He wants you to be patient so he can choose what he wants to do. No!! You don’t deserve that. You choose now to leave and not accept that behavior. Leave now. You don’t want to be stuck in an endless loop. Which most likely is what will happen. He will never change. Cheaters usually never stop cheating. They’re selfish and don’t care about the other person. If he cared about you he never would have cheated in the first place. If you keep permitting this behavior then you deserve it. Otherwise stand up now and tell him you won’t tolerate it.",
      "40": "Why is it up to him to decide?\nWhat do *you* want to do? Because I guarantee you, if he did it once, he’ll do it again. Are you willing to live like this ongoing with him having other partners?\nIf so, then work out ground rules for it that you can all live with.\nIf not, then dump his ass.",
      "41": "You make the decision real easy for him and know your worth.\nHe’s honestly got his cake and eating it too in this scenario. Why should you be patient? Why would you even stick around. Two years? No way, gtfo. I could maybe, MAYBE, forgive a once off, oops I was drunk. But a full on relationship over two years?! there’s no coming back from that. He’s not worth your patience, not even a further second of your time. Let the side piece have him, clearly they are okay with this behaviour.",
      "42": "Your husband has told you that he is unwilling to do anything beneficial for you, not even to make up his own mind about what he wants. He is telling you that he is a disloyal, dishonest, irresponsible, selfish person. Believe him and leave him. Let his affair partner have him all to herself. She won't for long.",
      "43": "I’m so sorry to say this but his inability to make a choice is a very clear choice. If he wanted you he wouldn’t have started and then continued this with her. If he wanted her he wouldn’t have said he just can’t make his mind up. You wouldn’t be a factor. However, I am a little skeptical because of life experiences. I really feel he doesn’t want to be the ‘bad guy’ so he is saying this to you so that you give an ultimatum and then he can say this was your fault. It’s sneaky. It’s not uncommon though. I would say though that an ultimatum is exactly what you should give if you want peace for yourself. Otherwise he will just remain flitting between the two of you, which is fair to no one.\n‘no choice’ is a choice.",
      "44": "You can be stupid and do nothing and let him take advantage of you, or you can be strong, throw him out and start to live a life free from manipulation and control. The choices are easy. Some people like to be controlled and used and others don’t. Find out who you are then make a decision.",
      "45": "Me personally, I would want someone to love me as much as I love them. I’ve been through pretty life-threatening situations, and not being somebody’s priority, would have been terrifying. your partner should be your support system. Everyone has a life and their own problems the support system you have outside of your partner may be there for some. It’s not. But people have their own life’s to worry about and you will never be their first. having a partner is deciding to spend your life together and figure out your problems together. You can’t have more than one person in the relationship and if there is you should leave. Because in the situation, it sounds like you are being taken advantage of because you were letting it happen. Imagine trying to get closer to your partner, but they can’t decide if they want to spend that one day a week with you or someone else that they have more interest in. And I say they have more interest in the other person because you were there first. How special do you feel? How does it feel to be second? Let’s say something happens to you and he’s out with the other person. You’re giving him a chance and waiting it out. You get in a bad crash, but he can’t make it because he’s out of town with her. It’s a crazy hypothetical situation but you only live once don’t you want a partner who loves you and likes you so much they would want to spend as much time as they can with you before they die. After working all week and doing all the little things you need to do he can’t even give you the time a day. After all the sweet things, my partner does for me I would never wish someone to feel little. You should be the other person’s world not someone they could live without not someone they can replace. I feel bad for you. I feel bad for you because you don’t see what is wrong with this and the comments that will come after this post will be targeting you. Leave you are worth so much more. How dare he take your time waste parts of your life and memories make you question your worth and your value. He has definitely created trauma from this action.",
      "46": "Decide for him. You’re allowing him to disrespect you, and disrespecting yourself in the process.",
      "47": "I agree he's wrong for not being up front in the beginning that he needs more than one woman. Having said that, do you really want to divorce him, or are others pressuring you to do so? Sounds like he's not going to leave you. He just has this side chick for extracurricular activities. Do what's right for your situation without letting outsiders project.",
      "48": "never be the second choice, if he loved you, he would never cheat. NEVER LET A MAN MAKE YOU FEEL LESS. You are God child, you are worthy and you are enough. May God bless you 🩷",
      "49": "I can’t tell you what to do but I will share with you what I would do.\nMy response would be to help him make the decision by telling him to leave and enjoy his life without me.",
      "50": "You know what most people don’t understand? That it can happen to them. They treat these situations like “it’ll never happen to me, but if it did I would do this..”. No, most of you wouldn’t do this or that. The first feeling a person gets is utter shock and after the shock comes the thought “I never thought this would happen to me.” Then of course you remember what you always agreed in your head. “If he cheats I’m gone.” Easier said than done.\nThe people who get to leave are the ones who don’t have to worry about money and how they’ll pay their bills. They don’t worry about how their children will be affected. They don’t worry about how others will talk and take sides. Yep even your friends and family will split down the middle.\nI’d ask why you stayed but it’s pretty clear. You love him, you love the life you have together at least at some level and you don’t want things to come crashing down. Many husbands and wives have made the choice to stay. Who are we as a society to say that’s wrong? Yes it’s psychological torture knowing our spouse loves themselves so much and us so little that they would be the one doing the torture.\nSo I’ll ask you this: what do you want to do? What are you willing to do? What does your peace mean to you? What consequences are you willing to take to gain your peace back? Who will this affect? How could this hurt them? What consequences might they feel? (I’m mainly talking kids here but who knows, there could be others too).\nKnow that whatever you choose is ok. You aren’t weak for staying and strong for leaving. You’re strong for dealing with a man who so lost in his own life that he is willing to bet the farm on an affair.\nYou may not be religious but I’ll pray for your peace regardless of what choice you make."

    "title": "Do murdered people automatically have no afterlife no karma no nirvana no heaven no hell and no soul according to modern science and modern experiments of science",
    "answers": {
      "1": "Science?\nYou do not know the meaning of the word.\nOriginal Question: Do murdered people automatically have no afterlife, no karma, no nirvana, no heaven, no hell, and no soul according to modern science and modern experiments of science?\nIf there is an afterlife why would unjustified death affect it? Where does it say that in ANY religous text?\nNo karma would be a great thing. Karma is inherently negative. There is no good karma. You want none. Being murdered does not erase your karma.\nNirvana is achieved through no karma. It is release from dharma, the cycle of death, and rebirth. If you have no karma you have Nirvana. They are interelated, and clearly you have an understanding of neither in any respective faith.\nIf you are murdered you will go to your correct afterlife, be it Heaven, or Hell. Being murdered does not alter your course unless you are murdered in God’s name. Doing whats right. Not relinquishing your faith in a bad situation. Such examples happened to many of Jesus’s desciples I do believe.\nIf you are murdered your soul is uninjured. It remains completley seperate from your body, and is a supernatural concept. Most religions have a concept of soul. Something intrinsic. Since it is seperate, and only tied to the body as if chained murder of the body would only be the release of the soul towards it’s destiny.\nFaith, and science have absolutley nothing to do with each other.\nScience is simply the scientific process. Many people think it’s more than it is.\n“The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.”\nScience is pne thing, and it is this:\nIt is a process to determine the natural world. Anything observable can be applied through a scientific lense. That is all. Nothing more like many make it out to be.\nThis:\nIs not science. They are DOING science.\nFauci seems to think he is science which is not the case. It’s asking questions, and testing over, and over again.\nTheology is NOT observable. Thus it is NOT scientific in any manner.\nThis doesn’t make it any less true. But a scientific lense won’t get you very far. You can’t see, touch, feel, taste, hear, or in any other way detect karma, soul, heaven, hell, or any other supernatural idea of phenomenon.\nI will not go into correct religion or anything like that regardless you are DEAD WRONG!\nBut despite you being a troll someone may have learned something, and this was fun to write.",

      "4": "You misunderstand the nature of the brain. Hardly surprising - science still has trouble with it.\nHere’s the thing though. Not all memories are stored as “atoms and chemicals”. Your brain is perfectly capable of physically changing itself to store information. It appears you do that when you sleep.\nBut during the daytime, your brain is quite the dynamic little thing. For three pounds of fatty stuff it can actually have more possible states of being than there are atoms in the universe. It’s constantly sorting out what’s not important to remember (like the phone number of the call you have to return) from information that’s critically important to remember (like the name of your kids).\nYour brain also has a big filter at the front called the “frontal lobe”. It constantly takes this mess and applies your personality to it to keep from doing stuff the rest of your brain wants to try (“let’s do that bungee jump”) from the things that you actually want to do.\nNow, we know a few things, one of which is that it takes time to store your current memories. If you suddenly lose consciousness due to an injury, it’s likely you will forget what caused the injury. My dad had a heart attack and couldn’t remember anything he did the previous week. For most people, it’s a few minutes.\nAlso, it appears your brain is wired like “Google”. If you get a stimulus, it propagates through the brain trying to find similar stimuli, which is why I was driven crazy watching “Oppenheimer” when I realized I had seen General Grove’s assistant before but couldn’t remember where (It was in “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets”).\nHere’s the fun thing - you can also create memories of things that never happened. Instead of taking your three year old to Disney, just tell her you did. She will insist she went.",

We don’t fully understand something, therefore your ancient goat herder mythology derived god bullshit? Yeah, no thanks, I’ll stick with “I don’t know”, you can go around vainly imagining you have knowledge you don’t, proudly wearing your ignorance induced magical thinking.

      "13": "And that has to do with atheism, how? “God made it happen” is just handwaving. Mystics explore the experience from the inside. Scientists go looking under the hood. Engineers build engines. Either way, there's a lot of trial and error, and for every answer there are new questions and new opportunities.\n“God,” “soul,” “fundamental force of nature,” all just labels and hand waving - unless you ask questions, look for answers, and start finding them.\nAnd for the record, “I am that I am” applies just as well for individuals as for Jehova. Or for animist sprites, or cells, or software processes. The inner experience may differ, but then how can we ever truly know anyone else's, or anything else's, inner experience - except maybe by getting lost in a common experience (be it singing, sex, meditation, sitting in Quaker Meeting waiting for the “still small voice” to show up & speak through some of us).",

      "16": "Neuroscientists don’t yet fully understand consciousness.\nYou cannot simply tack on “therefore, God” to the above sentence.\nAll the evidence points to our mind being a result of having a brain. If we had “souls” independent of our brains, then damage to the brain would not change our personalities. But damage to the brain can change a person’s personality, often drastically.\nNot fully understanding something does not mean we can invoke the supernatural as the explanation, especially with no evidence.",
      "17": "So what? We don’t know answers to lots of questions. Which does not make “God done did it” a correct answer.",
      "18": "Yes I do. “God did it” is semantically equivalent to “I don’t know, either.”\nOne of the differences between the religious and atheists is that atheists are OK with not knowing.

      "21": "So even if what you are saying is true, you might think about two points:\nThroughout history, there have been many things that were once unexplained. That doesn’t mean they never will be explained, just that we do not have an answer right now. Think about it — at one-time rain was a gift of the gods, the sun rose because it was a golden chariot being driven across the sky, diseases were caused by malevolent spirits . . .. Yet today we have actual explanations instead of fairy tales.\nThe other point is that even if there is something we do not know, that doesn’t give credence to any religious story.",
      "22": "How can it not?\nThere's nothing else to create experience…\nWe wake up with our memories every morning and our personalities intact by some chemical reaction that's fairly stable over time and allows us to share reality.\nWhat else could it be?",
      "23": "Theists, how can an invisible, magical phantom create subjective experiences—when the proposition is childishly absurd??",
      "24": "That question has nothing to do with disbelief in gods and god claims.\nIf you think a deity is responsible for your words salad, then prove it.",
      "25": "How is this supposed to be an argument for theism? Theism doesn’t provide an explanation of subjective experience, or why it is associated with brain activity. It’s an entirely separate mystery.",
      "26": "At least they’re honest enough to admit they don’t know, and not try to fill in some mythical being as an answer.",
      "27": "Atheists, how can a bunch of atoms and chemicals arranged a certain way in our brains create subjective experience?\nBy the process of natural selection therefore nothing supernatural is required to explain it (not that appeals to the supernatural explain anything at all since they are entirely unsupportable claims with no explanatory power whatsoever).\nDid you know that the smartest neuroscientists don't even know the answer to that one?\nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact neuroscientists understand consciousness so well now that they can make accurate predictions about how experimental subjects will describe entirely new unseen untested optical illusions before any experiments have been carried out. Now if f that isn’t because they have a pretty good understanding of how the brain operates I don’t know what else could be!\nIt’s akin to chemists understanding how newly invented polymer structures will bond and behave before they have even been created in the lab.

They cannot stop terrorism or Muslims treating women as second-class citizens at very best, robbing them of their human rights or worse making them impersonal, inhuman by hiding them.\nSo if you’re an objectivist religionist you have to say organized religion is the work of Satan or evil and it should be abolished, because it’s true!\nIf you don’t get that then you really shouldn’t argue with philosophers or scientists about whether God exists or not while in real life you go propagating something arguably pure evil.",

      "32": "Atheists, how can a bunch of atoms and chemicals arranged a certain way in our brains create subjective experience? Did you know that the smartest neuroscientists don't even know the answer to that one?\nThe brain is a product of evolution. Animals who could sense and react to their environment survived better than those that couldn’t. Animals who could retain information for use at a later time did better at surviving to reproduce than those that couldn’t. Animals that could use this information to form complex models of reality fared better in the wild than those that couldn’t.\nIt’s a little more complicated than “a bunch of atoms and chemicals arranged a certain way”. And neuroscientists understand that.\nThey also have a pretty good understanding of how the brain works. By modeling the behavior of neurons in the brain, scientists have been able to develop computers called “neural networks” that operate much like a functional animal brain. They’ve developed computers that use this type of learning and adaptation that can make better weather predictions than meteorologists. So I suspect neurologists have a pretty good idea how brains create subjective experience.\nBut, as pointed out, even if they didn’t (and at some point in the past they didn’t), that still doesn’t spell “God did it”. Using that line of reasoning is referred to as “God of the Gaps”. God used as a placeholder for anything we don’t understand. This is a God who gets smaller and smaller every time we learn something new.",

There are also a similar number of glial cells in the human brain which support those neurons. The neurons in the human brain are connected by about 100 trillion synapses. And all human brains, while having similar construction, are different.\nNeuroscientists have extrapolated a lot of knowledge about human brains by studying the brains of other animals and that has led to medical breakthroughs for people who are blind and/or hearing impaired. They are also able to help people who would’ve otherwise been paralyzed.\nSo while they don’t have all the answers to the brain, they have a lot of them already. God wasn’t helping them, either.",

      "48": "I think you’re mistaking atheists for something else, since it’s not about whether we have answers to everything, but about whether there’s evidence for gods. I also think you have a few problems with your conception of what makes for subjective experiences, but that doesn’t matter, no matter how ignorant one person might be about it, even if it were humanity itself that’s that ignorant, the fact is that it works, that we have such experiences, and nobody has caught gods doing anything in the brain.

Therefore they will claim that it somehow “proves” that all of their fantastic claims of a personal relationship with the Creator of absolutely everything - including all the WallMarts on the planet - is true in every detail. They accredit to their God everything they do not understand. In this way religion is just ignorance explained by make believe.",

If the theists are wrong, it cannot be God what done it.\nSure, we have, as yet, incomplete understanding of how some things work. So what? Why default to God? That is another fallacy (begging the question).\nFor me, souls, minds and spirits (and places they go to when we die) are imaginary. Chop someone’s head off and ask them to answer a maths-question."

There’s been at least two cases where soviet union had actually situation that called for launch of nukes as per orders.

A puppet government would be elected.\nThis is why no one believes nukes will be launched, even assuming all of the Russian hardware involved in the process still works.\nYou know it’s possible to behave like a normal country, even while led by a murderous dictator, and you will mostly be treated like a normal country?",
      "29": "Because a half an hour after he launched the missiles he would be dead due to a massive US counter strike. Russia would be an irradiated waste land.",

The west would never do that and it is probably the same with the nukes.\nThe west have defence systems such as Patriot or what they are named. Those will shoot down some of the Nukes. Not all, but some of them.\nI´m sure that Russia have similar systems but judging from the total lack of precision when shelling Ukraine, they´re not going to shoot down that many nukes from the west.\nSo, Russia sending nuke to the west would be very bad for teh west, but it would be catastrophic for Russia. That´s why Russia should stay away from their nukes.",
      "31": "Putin can try nuking the West with 60–70-year old nuclear weapons that do not even work for the most part, most likely, judging by the failure rate of his other Cold War age ordinance. Then, not sure about EU but the US claims that they can stop about 75–80% of the incoming missiles.

      "1": "Ignorance is curable - get some learning then question. Pilots did wear and use parachutes, so they existed. In fact, parachutes existed during the era of balloon flight.",
      "2": "Parachutes have existed, in one crude form or another, since the days of Leonardo da Vinci.\nParachute - Wikipedia\nDevice used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere Paratroopers deploying their parachutes during an exercise A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag or, in a ram-air parachute, aerodynamic lift . A major application is to support people, for recreation or as a safety device for aviators, who can exit from an aircraft at height and descend safely to earth. A parachute is usually made of a light, strong fabric. Early parachutes were made of silk . The most common fabric today is nylon . A parachute's canopy is typically dome-shaped, but some are rectangles, inverted domes, and other shapes. A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, space capsules , and bombs . History Middle Ages In 852, in Córdoba, Spain , the Moorish man Armen Firman attempted unsuccessfully to fly by jumping from a tower while wearing a large cloak. It was recorded that \"there was enough air in the folds of his cloak to prevent great injury when he reached the ground.\" [1] Early Renaissance The oldest known depiction of a parachute, by an anonymous author (Italy, 1470s) The earliest evidence for the true parachute dates back to the Renaissance period. [2] The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s Renaissance Italy (British Library, Add MS 34113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy. [3] As a safety measure, four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. The design is a marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall using two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars, which he grips with his hands. [4] Although the surface area of the parachute design appears to be too small to offer effective air resistance and the wooden base-frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent. [4] Shortly after, a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus (fol. 381v) dated to ca. 1485. [3] Here, the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. A square wooden frame, which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal, held open Leonardo's canopy. [4] It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design, but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist-engineers of the time . [5] [6] The feasibility of Leonardo's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by Briton Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by the Swiss skydiver Olivier Vietti-Teppa. [7] [8] According to historian of technology Lynn White , these conical and pyramidal designs, much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia, mark the origin of \"the parachute as we know it.\" [2] Fausto Veranzio 's parachute\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute",
      "3": "Why didn’t pilots wear parachutes? You mean like this pilot?:\nSee that canvas bag beneath her behind? That’s a parachute.\nOr this pilot?\nHe’s got a parachute strapped on too!\nIn fact all WW2 pilots wore parachutes.\nWhat are you smoking?",
      "4": "Yes, pilots wore parachutes during WW2. It was WW1 that some wore a chute or not. The higher ups were more concerned about the airplane than the pilot at the time. Planes were expensive. Some thought it cowardly to wear a chute. And by WW2 they realized that it was the highly trained pilot that needed saving. Parachutes been around since DaVinci time. During the Depression, so called barnstorming pilots would put on air shows, usually with a parachute act.",
      "5": "This is a highly complex and qpg concern. it delves into many aspects of AI.\nSo lets begin with some his/herstory of the parachute. He was invented by sam spade in 1903 during a mission in his zepplin. It was mortally wounded and going to crsh. Same realized he could grab n helium bag and use it to break his fall. He survived but all the 3000 other crew died because he destroyed the structure to get the bag out.\nSo when wwii came along her did not exist in true form until he opened the bag so to speak.\non the one hand it saved millions of pilots from certain death.\non the otherhand the japanese found the bags more useful for floating bombs to america.\nSo in summarry we may say that yes he/she/it /they were very much in popularity in some places and not others. We must remember that some people fell from 20,000 feet without them and survived.\nWhy didn't pilots wear parachutes during World War II? Did they even exist back then? If not, why not?",
      "6": "Parachutes were standard in WWII and I think available to some extent in WWI. Made of expensive and often unavailable silk from Asia in WWI and WWII, parachutes rapidly switched to DuPont’s post-1937 nylon synthetic fabric that was cheaper, more available, and stronger. Concepts for parachutes go back into the 19th Century for use from hot air balloons, hydrogen-filled rigid balloons, man-carrying gliders, and airplanes. Leonardo da Vinci sketched out a parachute design centuries earlier.\nA great uncle of mine had to land the shot-up plane on the closest clear part of an active battlefield in 1918 so likely would have used a parachute if he had one. That the primary American warplane, the deHaviland “Flying Coffin” frequently came apart in mid-air on first flight and rarely lasted several flights, generally killing the pilot, hopefully made the case for parachutes then.\nMy next door neighbor in the 1960’s was a bombardier in B17 shot down over Holland in 1942 and he survived by parachuting away from the burning plane.\nDo you think paratroopers, soldiers using parachutes, could have been such a high profile military unit for the British, Germans, Americans, and French then?",
      "7": "Well,pilots during the ww2 had access to parachutes,but for some reasons they didn't use them or should I say they weren't worn by all pilots.Many early WWII aircraft had open cockpits or cramped spaces, making it difficult to wear and deploy parachutes effectively…Parachutes can be bulky and heavy. In some cases, the added weight and space required for parachutes would have limited an aircraft's performance or payload capacity.Using a parachute effectively required training, and not all pilots received the necessary instruction. Additionally, ejector seats, which are common in modern military aircraft, were not widely available during ww2.\nThere were many other reasons too"

I can just stroll in there. So what if they’ve broken in?”\nI approached the room cautiously, unsure of who might be in there.

      "6": "One day I was visiting my best friend at the apartment he and his live-in girlfriend shared. The apartment had a single bathroom, and whoever had designed the floorplan clearly either didn’t think things all the way through or had an odd sense of humor, as there were two entrances to the bathroom: one from the master bedroom and the other from the rest of the apartment. If you didn’t think to lock both doors, it could result in a nasty surprise.\nWell, on this visit, I was sitting on the sofa with my friend, watching TV, while his girlfriend took a nap. After a few hours I went to the bathroom, and without a thought, just opened the door and went inside. Just in time to see his girlfriend right in the middle of changing clothes.

I did ask him if he didn’t have the time to clean everything, if it’s not bothering him at all, and told him I didn’t expect this at all. He just said, “I know,” and laughed it off. Every single corner was covered with plastic bottles and food containers. Thank God it wasn’t bug or rat infested.\nI couldn’t back out since it was late and far from where I live.

It was my best friend's birthday a day before the exam. Woah, We stayed up all night *having fun* and in the morning it was my exam. I was not in my *senses*i guess and thought I would crack the paper easily. It was a 100 mark theory paper. Outside the examination room I heard people discussing about chapters I never had heard of. I entered the examination room and sat on my seat. I till date regret the decision of entering that examination room without knowing anything. I sat the whole 3 hours blank and wrote stories which could be understood by martians. I failed that exam with 5 marks in that paper. Anyways, I got 5 marks for writing martian stuff.",
      "18": "I was once invited to networking with a group of VIP guests at Burj Khalifa. Even though I specifically told the host that I really didn’t want to - he just wouldn’t listen to me. And the reason I didn’t want to was because I DON’T dress up formal! I just don’t!\nBut he kept pestering me in and out. Finally, I caved in and said okay.\nOn the day of event, as usual, I went to the event and no sooner I entered - I suddenly saw a sea of over-dressed, power-suited and outrageously glamorous people. Almost immediately I had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. I suppose the feeling was mutual as the people in the party also stopped talking and gave me the most ridiculous stare.\nIt was more like disgust as I could define it.\nI walked in as the host came forward to meet, we shook hands and then he guided me to relax and enjoy the party.\nI stood in one corner and watched everyone drinking alcohol, acting all weird and larger than life while giving me ridiculous expressions and making sure I noticed their expressions.\nSo given how my personality was - I found a nice spot near a lamp, I asked one of the servers to get me a redbull and then I took my book (from my nice little carry bag) proceeded to read my book for the next two hours under a nice lamp without being too bothered who was doing what.\nThe host was kind enough to come and check on me twice to see if I was okay - which I let him know I was perfectly fine and in my own world. A few curious souls did come to talk to me - which I did. However, I kept the conversation short and got back to my book. And when it was time to leave, I put my book back into my bag and left.\nAnd yeah - that was the last time in my life I ever went to another party. Had enough of them by then. That is why now - I never attend any such events - until of course I am paid money for it.\nLoy Machedo",
      "19": "Yes.\nI was in 9th class and we had science practical (written) examinations. I was in C section and my viva went very well.

Before I go on with the story, you have to know that me and Dan like to just stay naked even if one of us has to go out of the room.\nSo we did what we had to do, and when we were done he offered to go and bring me a glass of water from the kitchen, which is just two doors away from my room. Off he goes, completely naked, until he suddenly stops right at the kitchen's entrance.\nHe turns around and I can see his face turn into many shades of red, his eyes wide open, one hand covering his mouth and the other covering his… well, you get it.\nWhat had happened? Well, my little sister came home earlier with two friends of hers, and walked into the kitchen at the same exact time as Dan, who happened to be completely naked.\nI think the worst part was hearing the giggling and the comments from the three 14-years-olds…",

      "25": "I was informed by my class representative that we have an extra lecture on Sunday. I was depressed as it was suppose to be 'my' day off … away from the drama and stress. But the thought of bunking the lecture didn't even cross my mind as the lecture was about orthopedics and a very esteemed orthopaedic surgeon had made time for us, practically ruining his Sunday as well.\nSo Sunday morning I get up with all my strength, put that fake smile on and rush towards the college as I wanted to sit on the first bench. I entered the room with a dash , like Dhoni attempting a cheeky run.

Cause this one is just over!\nThe professor smiled , closed his notes and walked out of the classroom.\nI was told by my CR the lecture is at 12 pm but the lecture started at 11am.

      "26": "This is interesting and funny, a bit embarrassing story.\nIt was 2013 family summer vacation in Sharm elsheikh city. I met a friend who I didn't see for years. After hellos and miss yous and how is life, we agreed to meet that night on a cafe.\nLater, we met on that cafe. We spent time in friendly talk and playing with my girls and talking in random topics.\nI asked him about his move from Cairo to Sharm and my previous bad experience working there. I asked him if he stopped chasing and dating girls and if he is thinking to marry. He said he is enjoying his life there and he most probably will not marry at all.\nThen he offered me something new and exciting that he is sure I never tried before. He offered to invite me to a cabaret. At the beginning I refused considering that my wife and little girls are there and It is not good to leave them alone to go to that place. He convinced me as it will be late after returning them to their room and we will not stay for long, so I agreed, just to try the night club life experience.\nI met him again at midnight and we went together to that cabaret. From the entrance, there was a feeling of uncomfortable mixed with excitement. I saw this in movies but now I'm in it!\nHe was known there by the staff, he was a regular client. Complementing him, they gave us a special table near the dance floor, where a belly dancer was performing, half naked of course.\nFrom the beginning I started to feel uncomfortable with the atmosphere. Darkness, flashing intermittent lights, smoke everywhere, very loud noisy music, and lots of half naked girls, obviously prostitutes looking for clients.\nAnyway, I'm in the situation now, and ok let's continue and see what will happen.\nFew minutes later, a waiter came to us, asked my friend: what would like to drink, sir?\nHe replied: cold beer please\nThen, the waiter asked me: what would you like to drink, sir?\nI said: emm, cold coca cola please\nThe waiter was shocked! Looked at me like an alien, he was almost fainted. He asked again: excuse me, sir!\nMy friend looked at me, just laughing, and said order a beer, man! We are not in school here!\nI smiled and said: I don't drink beer.\nHe said why!? It is not alcoholic!\nI replied I know but I but drink it, what's wrong in this!\nSo the waiter said ok and moved away to bring our drinks, looked really astonished, asking himself what brings that strange man here!\nMy friend continued laughing for a while. I was smiling and trying to enjoy the unpleasant time.\nA while later he winked at a girl, points with his finger inviting her to come and join us. I kept my artificial smile and said to him not to bring any girls to our table. He just laughed and didn't debate with me any more.\nWe spent their around one hour. He was completely ready to leave once I ask for this. When we left, I gave him a selected list of swear words for his invitation, and he was laughing out loud like crazy.\nWe are still friends and I met him in my last quick visit to sharm last month, but I didn't go to that place again and he didn't invite me any more.\nI didn't regret the experience, I didn't been in such place again, and I became more aware about night clubs life.\nTo be bad playful guy is very easy and convenient. To be respectful and keeping this is much harder.",
      "27": "As soon as i read the question, I flashed back to two separate incidents.\nThe first was in high school, 11th grade by my reckoning, during a drama club production. Much of the club and probably 90% of the tech crew (my role in that production) were female. As a result of the gender imbalance, there was a significant imbalance in dressing room usage, to the extent that we girls frequently used the designated men's dressing room. As a result, we were prone to just walk in unannounced. Chatting with a female friend acting in that show, we blithely stepped through the men's door, only to walk in on a male friend in his way-too-tightey whiteys. A large guy, small underwear, my first experience with the pink paleness of a natural red head. To say that image is seared into my memory would not be an overstatement!\nOver two decades later, I was reminded of the fact that my bare feet and my parents’ soft carpet lead to me making almost no noise as I walk through the house. Certainly not enough for my nearly 70 year old father to hear through an external grade door that separated the main house from his photography studio. As a result, I am more aware than I would like to have been that the resolution of his monitor made the open he was watching extremely clear. I froze, backed out even more quietly, and (once I cleared my brain a little) called out to get dad's attention without walking through the door again. I'd have left it alone, but i really needed a question answered. Now I can't even remember the question, but I'll never forget that blonde. Or her red headed friend.",
      "28": "Yes, It was the when I entered emergency ward of a govt. Hospital.\nOnce, we were playing football on a saturday night(at 9pm) when my friend slipped and fell on the ground while running at a very good pace.\nHe, therefore got injured very badly that there was a deep cut in his hand and we should immediately carry him to the hospital nearby.\nAs it was a week-end night, there were many other accident cases as well. (Driving after having alcohol is what I want to mention)\nBy the time we entered emergency ward, the only colour visible to our eyes was red and the only sounds we could listen were loud cries of the people suffering from pains.\nApart from the accident cases, there were many other people who were suffering from various other issues and the whole environment looked really dreadful.\n( It was just similar to how it was explained in story of Gautama Buddha, who encountered a diseased man, a decaying corspe and a dying person)\nThis incident kept striking in my mind for many times after I left that place and it always keeps reminding me that-\n“Life is not always as easy as you think and it doesn't always go in the way you plan it to be.”\nAnd I should be prepared to face it, what ever problem I may get.\nYes, I regret walking into that room which introduced me to problems one would face and fear of pain.",

I was very hungry and I asked random people for food but none paid attention.\nI now began my hunt for searching my mother. I searched everywhere but did not find her. Now there was just one room left, I entered saying has someone seen my mother, and to my horrors, few of my aunts shouted “Get out Fool”.\nProbably Wondering Why?\nWell, traditionally during weddings, all the women get dressed together (probably due to lack of space and rooms during weddings). The women were just about to change their dresses when I entered. A minute later my mom came up, asking me rudely why did I come in without knocking. I said I was just finding you, Sorry.\nWell I tried not to face my aunts throughout the wedding, I had to isolate myself.\nI once saw that one of the aunt that shouted on me was telling something to another lady pointing at me and laughing\nThat is the reason I regretted entering the room.\nAdvice- KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER",

One day, we were sort of sugar and thought of borrowing it from one of my friend. I wanted to drink coffee so i had to go there. We were close friends so we didn't have any formal courtesy of knocking the door. Same goes with that day, i straight away went to his kitchen and there was a window which was in between room and kitchen. And there my friend was being intimate with one of his classmate. They both were half naked and were shocked ( i guess so) after seeing me. I said sorry and left in hilarious laugh. I came to my flat without sugar and didn't tell anyone about it. Later that day, we all went for evening tea ( it is routine for all students ;) ) and there that friend came and whispered in my ear not to tell anyone. We went cool immediately as i didn't want to bitch about it.\nHowever, after one week he himself told everyone about their affair and we never discussed about it.",

One fine day, like that I was studying for my core exam which used to be important subject. So to secure good marks I was studying seriously. There was just 10 minutes to start the exam.

I was busy studying the formulae and before going into the exam hall I thought to have my pee so that there would be no disturbance in the mid of exam. As my only concentrate on my smartphone , i entered into the bathroom and saw that three girls were standing there . First I thought they entered the wrong bathroom. I was seeing them cluelessly, similarly they had a puzzled look. I informed them that they entered into the wrong bathroom (it was happening there when students are entering from other buildings). Still they were looking with puzzle. I was in the urgency because of my exam and told them to go out. Then suddenly other two girls entered there. After that only I came into reality and felt that the bathroom surrounding is not for gents purpose.!!!!!!\nOh my god it is me who entered the wrong bathroom. It was the face palm moment.

Let me tell you why I’m saying “childish”. During the time my dad bought a brand new rolling chair to my home. From that day onwards we began fighting more and the fight all about was who is going to use the Rolling chair since we had only one Rolling chair at my home that time.\nWe both were started using the chair randomly for sometime. But, later we realized that it did work out well as expected, so we decided who wake up first in the morning as well as who keep first his belongings on the chair then he can use it, the whole complete day.\nWell, this idea really was worked out well for me in particular because I use to wake up early in the morning for jogging. So almost 5 to 6 days a week I started using it. At one point of time my bro became angry, so what he did was he hid the chair in the store room before going to sleep.\nThe following day I was searching it, but unfortunately i couldn’t find it. So started out for jogging. When I back to home my bro was sitting on the chair and drinking coffee then I wonder and took it easy.\nThe next day also the trick continued. when I back from jogging I noticed my bro kept his belongings on the chair and standing near to it, then he saw me from top to bottom and I saw him from bottom to top.\nIt was crazy , still I remember those days..",

After a while I got off the Trolley and heard some good music and my ears led me to a white building less than a block away. I opened the door and partially entered and noticed that I was the Only white person in the room which was packed! A lot of the crowd just gawked at me with a surprised look on their faces. Normally I wouldn't be bothered by that but I was in an unknown neighbourhood and it was getting dark so I turned and walked back out the door and a good percentage of the crowd behind me laughed their heads off seeing this 19 year old white man looking in and then leaving. I even think I smiled and waved at them before departing."

      "1": "Cook the slightly spoiled sweet potatoes in the fridge, and everything else that will need to be cooked. Arrange some tables in the middle of the biggest room, pile books on top of the array and more to the sides and move a mattress in underneath. Fill the bathtubs and every available container with water.\nThere’s no use trying to go buy anything. Everybody else will be doing that. There’s no use running. If my home town of College Station is a target, it’s more nearly Armageddon than war, and I won’t survive no matter what I do. So I assume we’re not going to be hit but maybe Houston or Dallas will be. I’m preparing to ride it out and come out a couple weeks later, thinner and shivering but not done for.",
      "2": "I work in Ukraine and although a Russian nuclear attack is highly unlikely to occur, it can not be completely ruled out. We are prepared. At our office, the following procedures are in place in case of an imminent nuclear attack:\nWe relocate from our office building to a secondary office. This place was once the regional headquarters of the Soviet Army and there are facilties that can withstand a nuclear explosion.\nPotassium iodide tablets. Enough for 100 days. (Photo by the author of this post)\nWe have water and food reserves for 90 days there. Enough to survive the fallout and radiation phase after the blast.\nEspecially younger people should start taking potassium iodide tablets to prevent their thyroid gland from absorbing any (radioactive) iodide elements from the environment.\nAfter that, we will evacuate to a safer area. Again, everything is already in place: communication equipment, weapons, GPS devices, and, of course, NBC protection kits.\nIf you want to help me support Ukrainian volunteers (civilian and military, foreigners and locals), please use the contact email in my profile description.",
      "3": "We used to speculate about this quite a lot in the 1980s. However, in the UK we famously would only have 4 minutes warning of a nuclear attack.\nBeing feisty young men, I am afraid the conclusion was always to try to have sex. The joke was always, “yes, but what will you do with the other three minutes?”",
      "4": "Well, like most Americans who live near major targets (in my case, New York City, but more specifically as a military targets Port Newark and Mcquire/Fort Dix/Lakehurst Military Airlift Command), I expect I will die in traffic trying to get home to die with my wife.\nSomehow, dying in traffic is a true New Jersey way to go, actually.",
      "5": "I would dive into my alcohol collection, and have some booze, while I shower quickly. Then, I’d go to my bar of choice, and see about having a drink with someone there; maybe, if I’m lucky, find someone where we can at least hold each other in the short time we have left. On the way to this bar, I’d send out a few messages, to the important people in my life.\nI live in the capital, which, in an all-out war, would mean I die.\nIf I have the choice, I’m not dying sober and alone.",
      "6": "It’s extremely doubtful that you would have two hours of advance notice. In fact, you may not receive any advance notice at all. In the U.S., our “Civil Defense”, Comprehensive Emergency Management & Homeland Security system might trigger some televised and radio warnings, perhaps 15 minutes before a bomb strike, but I wouldn’t count on that.\nMy wife and I are already prepared for most disasters. We have food, water, important papers, weapons, ammo, clothes, tents, spare fuel, a generator, flashlights, lighters and other things, as well as evacuation points, radios and other items.\nHowever for a nuclear strike, things are different than for fire, floods and earthquakes.\nIf you are close to a primary target, it’s unlikely that you would survive at all. The explosion, blast and thermal shock will utterly destroy everything in a certain radius, depending on the size of the warhead. So the first step to “prepare” is to choose a home that’s never too close to a major metropolitan area or military base.\nSecond is the problem with nuclear fallout. If you’re in your home, turn off your HVAC system, close all windows and stay inside until the fallout danger is manageable. Otherwise, radiation sickness could kill you in a matter of days, weeks or even months.\nThird, do not run any water, which will come from a public supply. Turn off the water main. Use your stored supplies only for drinking and cooking. That can include water stored in your water heater.\nFourth, don’t count on your cars or any electronic items to work. If you are relatively close to a blast zone, the EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) will likely fry any micro-electronics, including automobile ECU’s, radios, TV’s, cell phones, computers and more. You can help protect your household electric appliances and things by shutting off the power main. Some preppers keep a heavy metal box or safe, which can even be an ammo can, and keep a transistor radio, cell phone, batteries and other items there, which may be protected from an EMP.\nFifth is a tip from old CD films from the 1950’s and 1960’s, and that’s to stay away from any windows. Pretty common sense…\nSixth, if you have a basement, get in it and stay there. Basements are much more safe and secure than being above ground. A properly prepped basement should have a cache of emergency supplies stored there for emergencies. A proper basement should also have a door, which can be securely closed.\nWith all of this, preparing for a blast should take you less than 5 minutes and once you close windows, shut off the water and power, turn off the HVAC system and move away from any windows, preferably to a central area of the house or to a basement, you just wait it out. You stay inside, possibly for days or weeks, until the risk from fallout is minimal and try to obtain information by listening to a radio. If you are a ham operator, or even have a working CB radio, you can try to communicate that way, but don’t count on those things being functional. Many communities have EOC’s (Emergency Operation Centers) which will use radio to transmit emergency information and conduct operations from. Sheltering in-place rather than evacuating is always a better plan, when it comes to nuclear attack.",
      "7": "I work in Ukraine, and while it's very unlikely that there will be a nuclear attack from Russia, we want to be ready just in case. So, at our office, we have plans in case this ever happens:\nWe have a second office that used to be a big Soviet Army headquarters, which means it's built to survive a nuclear explosion.\nWe have a supply of potassium iodide tablets, enough for 100 days. These tablets are important because they help protect our bodies, especially for younger people, from absorbing harmful radioactive iodide from the environment.\nWe also have enough food and water to last for 90 days at our second office. This should help us stay safe during the period when there's fallout and radiation after a nuclear blast.\nIf things get really bad, we have plans to evacuate to a safer area. We've already got all the equipment we need, like communication tools, weapons for protection, GPS devices, and special kits for protection against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats.\nIt might seem like a lot, but it's just to be well-prepared and stay safe in case of an emergency.",
      "8": "I live in the Seattle Metro, probably a massive target do to all of the military, manufacturing and port facilities here.\nI do have an actual plan for this though because of this fact.\nI would pull out my 25year MacCallen Scotch, grab 2 hours worth of cigars and enjoy my last moments on earth staring at nature with my wife at my side happy to be spending my last moments with her.",
      "9": "I would caution everyone whose response starts with “I would go…”. Stop right there. Unless you live in a sparsely populated area, you are not going anywhere in two hours. The average time in traffic for a normal work/school day is half-an-hour….but can be an hour-and-a-half in larger cities. That is normal traffic, where people go to school and work is relatively spread locations and on schedules that are typically staggered over a 2–3 hour period. We are talking bout a time where everyone will panic and hit the roads at exactly the same time….and all heading to the same destinations.\nAlso you must keep in mind that our highway systems are designed to bring everyone into the city. They are NOT designed for everyone to leave a city. The ramifications for a mass evacuation cannot be overstated.\nLiving in New Orleans, I have been through several mass evacuations and have also worked on several disaster recoveries. Unless you have a couple of days notice, you are not going to get out safely. And if you get out, where exactly are you going? Hopefully not to the next big city. No small towns will have accommodations for the fleeing urban masses. There is no unique idea you will come up with that several thousand people will have already beaten you to. We are not as unique as we think. Even camping in the woods, every park would be full beyond capacity and that assumes you can get your camper out lol.\nThe reality is if this were a real event, most people will be killed on the roads trying to stock up on supplies or trying to get out. Fortunately, the real reality is a true nuclear war is not going to be taken out as many large cities as each opponent can. That war strategy is pretty stupid. Most large cities will be relatively safe…unless your large city happens to be Washington DC or hosts strategic military command centers. Most of the actual targets will be military bases and the small towns that support them. Towns most of you have never heard of. Think Shreveport, LA and Barksdale Airforce Base.\nWhere I am in New Orleans, we will definitely be on the list, but not in a first or even a second strike as there are no nuclear weapons facilities or command posts here. What we do have is significant ports, refineries, chemical plants and energy plants. We are on the list, but not at the top. So perhaps we get 4 hours notice instead of two LOL. But I also know from experience this city cannot be evacuated in less than 72 hours AND this requires the full cooperation of Louisiana and Mississippi. That means if Baton Rouge needs to also evacuate, our routes west are no longer an option. And if the Mississippi Gulf Coast needs to evacuate, our routes east are no longer and option. And if Hattiesburg needs to evacuate, then our route northeast is no longer an option. So that means 3 million people from Baton Rouge, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast will all share some rooms in Jackson, MS. There is a great BBQ place there off Fortification that I really like. I’m pretty sure they can feed my family and 3 million of my closest friends.\nAs far as what I will do, we will ride this out in the most secure room we have in our house. Unfortunately this room is on an exterior wall. I will have to board up the two windows. We will cover the closet into a temporary bathroom. The room’s door will be sealed in case the home is breached. We will have our water (I always have 100 gallons), some non-perishable foods, batteries, radio, etc. I will have my usual stockpile of gas outside of the home…and away from the home so that I can eventually run the generator as in a hit power will be out. Medical services will be sparse for a few days-weeks so you will need some basic first aid supplies on hand. Honestly, this no different from any hurricane we annually prepare for….except I don’t normally seal doors.\nMy expectation is that in the high probability our house is not destroyed and we are not killed, my wife and I will need to immediately report to work where we serve as engineers for two large utilities. Our children can be self-sufficient in our absence for a few days. Phone services will likely be out so we won’t know until someone shows up to pick us up.\nMost of us will fair just fine as long as we don’t panic and do something stupid.",
      "10": "I'd drive an hour north to Dover AFB. Surrounded by many high value targets, DC just across the Chesapeake Bay, not to mention the Naval Academy, Norfolk to the south, I'd want to be as close to ground zero as possible.\nRadiation sickness is hell, I am told. No thanks.",
      "11": "Two whole hours is way better than the 30mins.\nDuring the time it would take me to walk over the road to the shops I’d have the bath tub filling with cold water and checking the wind direction for potential fallout from any potential strike zones. If I’m directly in the fallout zone then I’m screwed and if I’m in the strike zone I’m more screwed.\nAssuming the best I’d grab just tinned goods whilst everyone went for water and run back home. If looting rules apply and people were being people I’d bypass tinned (as have a good 30 day supply at home) and grab cleaning goods, cooking oil, maybes some nice ice cream and as much medicine from the pharmacy I could. Already have several jerrycans for water and actual bottles would take up room. I’d get home, fill the cans with water. Seal the water tank out back, turn off the town water and cut power to the house 10minutes prior and wait for the best.\nIf we have do have a fallout issue the house is screwed but at least I’d have more time to play with than a direct strike so let’s consider it the same as dealing with a direct hit.\nIf nukes were inbound I’m loading up the family boat, packing everything I could need and a few items I’d want and heading for the boat ramp to launch. I’m on the coast and with supplies loaded in less than an hour I’d have about 30–45minutes to sail out to sea. I would just drive the car into the water and let the boat float off the trailer directly if time was running out. Key point to remember would be to shut everything electronical off about 10minutes prior to impact that way after the EMP hit I could restart with little issue.\nWhere I’m located we really aren’t in a position to deal with a nuclear strike and I’m not so much of a doomsday prepper that I have a years worth of MRE’s (only about a months worth for 2 people). A direct hit or fallout would wipe my community out so going to the ocean and sailing to some offshore coral island would be best, supplementing fresh fish and crabs with canned goods and vitamin supplements. Seasonal tropical fruits and vegetables plus hunting sea birds would have to do for the time being. With onboard solar powered desalination and such suppling drinking water.\nEven if we weathered the initial storm at home that would only give us more time to properly prepare to launch the boat. Should local society breakdown and issues occur I’d pack up and leave heading to the ocean hoping ‘On The Beach (the 1959 or 2000 movie)’ doesn’t become a reality.",
      "12": "ICBMs typically take about 90 minutes from launch to impact. So a number of questions arise. Am I the only one who knows or does everybody know? Did China just nuke Taipei and Guam so we know it’s going to escalate rapidly?\nSo, I’m guessing something is coming soon. But I also know a few things. First, the big surprise after a nuclear strike will be the huge number of initial survivors. Instant kills will be those within a few miles and exposed in the open. Even a modest amount of shelter will mean you probably survive. Also the radiation levels will return to normal after about a week.\nErgo, despite living near large commercial economic and potential dual use targets (airport, port, etc), there’s a good chance I won’t die instantly. Then I’ll want to maximize my chance of surviving past that first week along with my family.\nThe best chance of survival will be in an underground concrete parking garage several miles from any nearly ground zero. I know 4 or 5 within a couple miles’ radius. I’d load up the family with as much food (I have some camping food in storage), water, blankets, medicines, and a solar battery charger, tools, TP, and anything else I can think of, throw it in the truck, and plan to camp out in the nearby hospital underground parking garage to wait it out with a couple hundred other people who thought the same thing.",
      "13": "First of all, the chances of a nuclear war seems pretty minimal these days, but it is of course still nice to be prepared for future emergencies. I spent several weeks looking into this, and here is a quick summary of what i found…\nSurvival equipment:\nAs logistics is so important in any war, these things will be a target for any enemy, and so you probably want to stock up on essential survival equipment in advance (good quality is essential). Such equipment may include anything from first aid kits, sowing kits, duct tape, fishing gear, clothing (maybe some camo colors), water filters, backpack, knives, Leatherman, knife sharpener, tents, sleeping bags and sleeping pads (ideally ones that are good enough for winters), a good supply of firestarting equipment (tips below), camping cook set (id recommend a wood stove that can be used as stand for alcohol stoves), trekking poles (having 2 extra “legs” is extremely helpful if you need to hike long distances quickly), map and compass, GPS, camping solar panels (at least 20W), book on edible plants in your area, etc.\nFor firestarter, i keep a modified “permanent match” inside my Exotac “NanoSpark” flint lighter. You can get packs of 100 flints pretty cheap on ebay, and this will last for many years. A gallon of your favorite liquid fuel (alcohol or gasoline) would also last a long time if you only use it for the permanent match. For tinder, cotton pads with some candle wax works really good with “flint style” firestarting tools. Alternatively cotton rope that is charred in one end will easily catch a spark from the flint (google “trench lighters”), but it needs to be kept really dry.\nBeing in reasonable physical health is of course also important, and going for regular hikes with a backpack or weighted vest is a very good way to prepare, and may also help with mental health.\nWhat to expect:\n2 hours can leave a reasonable amount of hours to prepare, as long as you are not too close to the blast. Then radiation from fallout is your biggest immediate concern, and by knowing what speed and direction the wind blows will give a rough estimate of the time you have to prepare. You may also want to check the link below, to see what to expect from different nuclear bombs detonating in areas you think may be a target. If you live near either nuclear silos or military bases with nuclear submarines or bombers, this would be the #1 target for an enemy. Regular military bases is a secondary priority. Big cities could perhaps be a target, but most people would NOT be happy about their government nuking civilians like that, so… The Nukemap page has a lot of settings, and by default, it has turned off “fallout”, and is set detonation to “airburst”. You can change this and all kinds of other parameters as you wish. If you dont know what an “airburst” is, then this is when a bomb is detonated above ground. This will create a bigger blast radius than a “surfaceburst”, but as long as it is detonated high enough in the air, it will create very little fallout. As fallout is the #1 danger for most people, i suggest setting it to surface burst, and enable the “fallout” option. You also want to adjust wind speeds to get an idea of what the best and worst case scenarios may look like…\nNUKEMAP by Alex Wellerstein\nNUKEMAP is a mapping mash-up that calculates the effects of the detonation of a nuclear bomb.\nhttps://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\nRadiation:\nThe radiation levels of nuclear fallout is very different from nuclear waste at power plants; which can last for well over 1000 years. Fallout on the other hand drops to safe levels much quicker, so after ~49 hours, you may consider going out to quickly get to a better shelter.\nA guy who works with radiation explained that after the first 7 hours, it has already dropped to 1/10 of what it started as. After this, the rule of thumb is that it will take 7 times longer for every time it drops to 1/10 of its previous value. So after (7hours * 7 =) 49 hours it will have dropped to 1/100, and after about 2 weeks it is down to 1/1000. This is still not safe for prolonged exposure, so you should stay in shelter as much as possible during the first 100 days. After this the radiation has dropped to normal levels, so you can go back to (whats left of) your normal life.\nDont worry about nuclear winter:\nNuclear winter is a misconception from the 80s, and in reality you should only expect a few drops of degrees if a MAJOR nuclear war broke out, with half its detonations being surface bursts that throw a lot of dust into the atmosphere. This is predicted based on a comparison to really big volcano eruptions in the past.\nShelter preparations:\nIf you got a basement with concrete walls on all sides, then you have at least a decent start, but my basement walls are only about 1 foot thick, and you need 24″/61cm of concrete - or 36″/79cm of packed dirt or sand - to lower radiation down to to about 1/1024 of what it is outside. DO NOT fool yourself thinking that 90% of this thickness will give you 90% of the protection, because such a shelter will actually give you TWICE the radiation dose..! This is because you need a certain thickness of material to cut radiation in half - and after 10 such “halving thicknesses” you are down to 1/1024.\nSandbags are cheap and very practical for such purposes, but remember that fallout will also land on your roof, so you probably want to put a table or something on top, so you can support sandbags over your head.\nWater:\nAs water would be contaminated with radioactive particles, you probably want either a big tank or many smaller bottles with enough water to last for 100 days. If i were to drink water that had been stored that long, id want a water filter, but i believe 2 or 3 drops of bleach in 1 liter of water is enough to kill bacteria (you should google this to make sure its the right amount). As a last resort you can create a water filter from rocks and sand and dirt. Im not sure how good this works, but it goes without saying that the more water you pour into such a filter, the further down the radioactive particles will flow, and so you will need to get new clean soil (dont use the top soil) and sand and rocks after some use. To get rid of potential bacteria in the filtered water, you may also want to use a commercial water filter, but i would not use this to get rid of the radioactive particles.\nFood:\nA camping cook set is of course essential, and investing in a “food dehydrator” is not just good for preserving foods for this type of situations, but even in every day life it is extremely practical to have access to precut potatoes, carrots, onions, broccoli, mushrooms, etc..! Suddenly making tasty home made dinners from scratch goes as quick as less healthy alternatives at the store. Home made food is often a good way to save money, and as your ingredients get a long shelf life when properly dried, you can save even more money by not having to throw away half packs of spoiled foods. You also save power by boiling bigger batches of potatoes in one go. I can fit maybe 5kg/10pounds of shredded potatoes in my dehydrator, and by shredding them all in one go, i save a lot of time compared to if i were to make many smaller batches on a daily basis - and i dont get as much dirty dishes every time i make dinner. A food dehydrator is also really nice if you like camping, or maybe you want to make a quick and easy and tasty and nutritious dinner during day hikes.\nBoredom:\nSitting in a shelter for 100 days can get really boring, so having some activities to pass the time is also “important”. I bought a couple of 20.000 mAh power banks so i have power for playing some music and games on my phone, and watching videos on my cinema glasses. If you are with other people, it may be nice with a deck of cards, yatzee, backgammon, and other such games. Oh, and dont forget candles..!",

By the time DSP satellites detect Russian launches, a threat assessment conference determines it is an actual attack with the aid of other sensors, the president is put in the loop, and the rather creaky Emergency Alert System is activated, RVs will already be detonating on their targets.

I’m guessing my wife and I could sit on our deck with our kids, 29 and 23, and I could smoke my precious Drum tobacco again!

This is the exact promise:\n“I swear to God I will never smoke another cigarette … unless there is a nuclear war. Then I will.”\nI’m a smart guy, so I included a loophole in my promise to God. I love smoking Drum hand-rolled cigarettes, so at least there will be a little bright side (pun intended) if there is a nuclear blast near enough our town to gradually kill us. And I will buy several bottles of Johnnie Walker Blue Label scotch.\nI would try to get my nuclear (LOL) family together, which is often doable since our kids live nearby.

Hoping that the hills, the woods and the whole location of the house along with the house cellar would shelter me and my family from initial impact.\nIf I was far away from home outside in the city centre of the potential target, unable to return home in time I would go in the deepest underground garage and wait for it. I do not know why, but I want to help people in the future, I know stuff that might get handy to other people and also to teach other people afterwards not do the same mistake they did while I was younger (If I would survive).\nMy country is so unimportant in any major conflict between Russia, USA, China and India, that there are more potential targets further away from my country which has quite a lot of Alps and other difficult terrain which would absorb some of the initial blasts from cities around.

Heavily barricade all but a couple entrance doors on the least likely sides of the house to take a blast. Come to think of it, I might even park the cars in front of the windows and/or doors. Given any extra time, I would fill sandbags and trench around the house to slow crowds. I would move as many bricks as possible inside the house to either reinforce openings or to build dead falls. Hopefully, there would have been some indications the situation was becoming dire so some of this would be done ahead of time. Oh, I would wrap some electronics in foil and place them in the safes, hoping at least some would survive if it turns out there is anything to the EMP scares. I would try to orient them so they were facing different directions since a narrower edge facing the pulse should reduce the developed voltages if the metal can't block everything. Gather any viable seed and include it into the togo bags. Distribute some of those loaded weapons into the togo bags.

Go over to my godchild and hug her and then wait, maybe watch my favourite movie or go for a meal to my favourite restaurant (assuming I’m the only one aho knows whats going to happen and all other things run as normal). If it’s a large scale nuclear war in Europe that contaminates where I am, it’s not a world I would want to live in afterwards. At 50 years of age, I’ve had a wonderful life with people I adore and a job I love. Just surviving wouldn’t be worth it to me, so I would do nothing to prepare.",
      "44": "It depends on if it’s nuclear war or nuclear annihilation.\nAssuming the targets attacked are strictly military, I would stock absolutely everything I could get my hands on and hunker down, rationing everything in a hope to outlast the fallout. Maybe when the dust settles there’ll be something to return to and a genuine hope of rebuilding.\nIf cities and towns were being bombed indiscriminately however, I would use these two hours to travel to wherever ground zero was predicted to be as fast as possible, from there I’d probably get wasted.\nI know when I’m beaten, and a complete societal collapse along with radioactive fallout and an indefinite nuclear winter topped by a population gone feral, knowing everyone you love is either dead, dying, or giving up and every bite of food or sip of water that you manage to find once you exhaust your rations beginning to slowly poison and ultimately kill you, if you aren’t murdered first, sounds an awful lot like defeat to me.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "Because some of them don’t want to see these facts:\nThe Republic of China was founded in Nanjing, China.\nThe Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat-sen, a Chinese.\nThe Republic of China took down the last Chinese empire and claimed to be the new legitimate Chinese government.\nThe Republic of China was referred as and only as “China” during even years after its occupation of China.\nThe Republic of China included all parts of China including Taiwan and Mainland.\nIf they want to say that Republic of China is Taiwan and China is anther country, then they should respond for their “invasion” to China from 1912–1949 because obviously they occupied lands that belong to “another country”.",
      "2": "Some of them were complaining that the 11.11 shopping day on Taobao did not include free shipping of Taiwan and that is like admitting Taiwan’s independence. They say they are Chinese when they can take advantages, they deny they are Chinese when it does no harm to them and they are still working on de-sinonization. Hypocrites.",
      "3": "Two very obvious points,\nThe group of Taiwanese who are “so insistent on being considered not Chinese” doesn’t overlap with the group who “proudly claims 5000 years of Chinese history” too much. There simply aren’t that many individuals who hold both views simultaneously.\nThere are some who identify more with the “old China” and are distant or even hostile to the “new” part - not the “China” part - of the “new China” aka the PRC.",
      "4": "Because many are young and naive ideological warriors who will say anything to make themselves feel special and to put themselves a step above the “uncivilized mainlanders”.\nThat is until the reality of stagnant wages and limited economic prospects of Taiwan hits them squarely in the face, at which point many suddenly have no qualms with seeking better paying jobs in China. If they are so resentful of being called Chinese, why are they taking advantage of the numerous preferential policies the Chinese government is offering to Taiwan workers or entrepreneurs on the mainland? Business startup subsidies, preferential tax treatments, rent/lease assistance and so on? So much for their pride.\nI was born in Taiwan and I despise the above mentality. It reeks of hypocrisy. Every time I go back there, I will not hesitate to call out these morons for their limited understanding and uninformed opinions. These types of “China allergy patients” are so woefully equipped for proper debate, they usually just end up being silent or cuss me out after I bring up genetics, immigration history as well as expose their limited world views and understanding of modern China.\nThese folks are just pawns for US and Japanese interests, nothing more. The truly sad part is that they are willing participants in that farce but doesn’t even realize it.\nI’ll close by putting all of the above into proper perspective. If Taiwan (and Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu etc) suffered from a massive natural disaster tomorrow and the entire populace has to be evacuated, would Japan and the US be willing to let millions of Taiwanese refugees in overnight? A few thousand or tens of thousands perhaps but 20+ million? Fat chance. In reality the vast majority of Taiwanese refugees will simply end up being taken in by the mainland due to the cultural and historical ties. The irony.",
      "5": "A few years ago before Covid strikes in, both of my parent went to Taiwan to visit their friend who already settled there.\nThe guy is genius in his class that he got a job as Chip designer at TSMC, and thus are able to live there. However, despitie still calling himself Chinese and married to a waishengren, he is now pro-green because based on his bad experience in Indonesia he is just unsure how the social-political in Taiwan will become after unification which is obviously will be under the control of the mainland government. According to my mother, he pointed out how the change of social politics in Hong Kong is making him sure that despite the beauty of the PR China, its social-political life just doesn’t fit him.\nHis daughter is a pro-green die hard who don’t think herself as Chinese. This confused both of my parents: a person born from two Chinese don’t consider herself Chinese. After some long “interogation” by both of my parents (just fyi, my mother was a retired HR manager, who can dig trough ones true intention from her experience dealing with dishonest employees) over how absurd her thought is, eventually she broke down and admit that the only reason she believes herself to be not a Chinese is because she wanted to live in a free-democratic country.\nThe point I see here is the Taiwanese are just close-minded people who maybe have never been outside of their island to know that there are Chinese who also prefers to live in a democratic country rather than living in an authoritarian one like China. They have basically associated Chinese culture as an authoritarian culture almost the same as some people associated Islam as terrorism, that’s basically being racists if you can think about it. So the solution for them is to denounce their own culture in order become democratic, which obviously this sounds like cultural revolution to me, except its way less violent.",
      "6": "During the past 20 years, the DPP brainwashed its citizens, using the mass media, textbooks, etc, and changed the definition of Chinese to citizens of People’s Republic of China. As of now, they are still not governed by PRC. So they will tell everyone that they are not Chinese.\nAlso, routinely they, mass media controlled by DPP and some bother media controlled by KMT, reported only negative news about China, sometimes true, most of the times deliberately made-up fake news, to their citizens to let them form a negative view/ hatred toward China. So, their citizens naturally didn’t want to have any connections/relationship with PRC. Thus, a generation of 天然独 naturally pro-independence were created inside Taiwan Island. They will never admit that they are Chinese.\nIn short, the word Chinese has a different definition in Taiwan, which was redefined by DPP trough years of brainwashing.",
      "7": "One time, I stayed at an Airbnb, and my host family were a pair of older middle aged Taiwanese couple. They were benshengren (meaning their ancestors were Fujianese immigrants to Taiwan 300+ years ago, and not the KMT soldiers who came to Taiwan in 1949). They were very friendly and chatty, and we ended up talking about random stuff, including politics.\nAccording to this couple, they see themselves as Chinese (中國人, and not just 華人). They see themselves as the true inheritor of the Chinese culture and heritage, unlike the Mainland, which had lost it to the Cultural Revolution. Yet, when I asked them if they think Taiwan belongs to China, their answer was “no”. I was at first, shocked by this response, because I haven’t really encountered any Taiwanese like them. After talking to them some more, I learned that they immigrated to America over 30 years ago. And that pretty much tells me everything that I need to know.\nI’m not that old, but I do have my parents and grandparents to go off on. According to them, during the White Terror era, Taiwanese independence was actually considered to be a fringe movement. Yes, it was true that most benshengren were pro-democracy and anti-KMT, but at the same time, most benshengren didn’t see themselves as separate from the Chinese. In fact, some 80’s propaganda even claimed that the Tangwai (meaning political parties that are not in alliance with the KMT) to be the true spirit of Chinese democracy, which is what Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Republic of China, would have wanted. The education back then drilled into the minds of every Taiwanese student that Taiwanese people are Chinese.\nFast forward to the 90’s and early 00’s. You have two back to back presidents who endorsed Taiwanization, Lee Teng-Hui and Chen Shui-Bian. Taiwanization was a series of policies that de-emphasized Taiwanese people’s connection with China, and that Taiwanese people are a distinct group of people with our own identities. Arguably the most successful Taiwanization policy was the educational reform, where studies emphasizing Chinese heritage in Taiwan are either downplayed or remove, and insisting that Taiwanese history is in its own classification, separate from Chinese history. In literally one generation, Taiwanese people went from thinking, “We are the true inheritors of Chinese culture” to “Taiwanese people are not Chinese, ethnically, culturally, or politically”.\nToday, I do not know of even a single Taiwanese person my age or younger who sees themselves as Chinese. And I don’t just mean “Chinese by nationality” (even though our country is the Republic of China); Taiwanese people my age do not even think Taiwanese people are culturally or even ethnically (in extreme cases) Chinese. When I go back to Taiwan, every single Taiwanese people my age is shocked when they learn about my political views. They tell me that they do not know a single Taiwanese my age who does not support Taiwanese independence… not their friends, not even the friends of their friends. One of them even told me that some Taiwanese believe that the Traditional Chinese characters were invented by the Taiwanese, while simplified Chinese was invented in China (Jesus Christ, that is pathetic beyond belief).\nThe older middle aged Taiwanese couple I met in my journey across America left Taiwan 30 years ago, so their mindset is still stuck in the 1980’s: that Taiwanese people are the true Chinese, but that Taiwan is not part of China. Had they stayed in Taiwan the whole time, I have a feeling that their views probably would have changed as well.\nAs such, OP, I’m almost positive that the Taiwanese people you’ve met are Taiwanese who were born and raised in Taiwan, but left Taiwan a long time ago, so they were stuck with the mindset that the education in Taiwan before the democracy era implemented in them. If you were to go back to Taiwan now and talk to the Taiwanese people there, you will find that nobody agrees with you.",
      "8": "I think there are many factors involved, mainly historical, political, social and even emotional to some extent; and some of these factors are intertwined.\nHistorically, Communist China did not physically rule over Taiwan or for that matter Hong Kong. And until Deng Xiaoping's \"Reform and Opening Up\" policy was mooted in the late 1970s, mainland China was the poorest and most backward part of the Sinosphere (大中华圈), whereas Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong were already called the \"Little Tigers of Asia\", together with South Korea. In those days, the lion's share of mainland China's import/export trade went through Hong Kong. In this sense, HK has played (and is still playing) a vital role in China's economy. Simultaneously, Deng Xiaoping had to humbly behave as a small student to learn the trick of nation-building from Premier Lee Kuan Yew from the little red dot, Singapore (SG), who on the other hand, had to learn from Taiwan on military and defense. It was natural under this background, that all three little Asian tigers displayed an air of superiority over clumsy China, although all are genetically Han people.\nAlthough things have changed since but it was these little tigers that become too clumsy to mentally adjust to the current relation with a fast- changing and progressing China ! And hence up till today, each of them still reserves a derogatory name for mainland Chinese: Ah Chan (阿燦) from the Hongkies, Ah Tiong (阿中) from Singaporeans, and Ah Lak (阿陆) from Taiwanese.\nAs Gordon Hsu has so correctly pointed out, it has already dawned on many Taiwanese that their false feeling of superiority over mainland Chinese will do them no good at all. The earlier they wake up, the better. As regards the Hongkongers, to be fair, the likes of Joshua Wong, Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Baggio Leung Chung-hang (calling China as “Geen-na” or “Shee-na” and displaying a banner bearing the words “Hong Kong is not China”) belong to an absolute minority. I will not comment on SG's attitude towards mainland China, as it is a sovereign nation. But 75% of Singaporeans are ethnic Chinese, and their \"smarter than the uncivilized Ah Tiong aka 阿中\" mindset should not be condoned and should be condemned.\nBut easy, all these will become history as motherland China finally takes over America as THE greatest nation in the world economically, diplomatically and...militarily !",
      "9": "The people in Taiwan has been not governed by Central governments for long time and don’t remember their high life level roots from the policy of western countries against the mainland. Those island’s people are too naive to know the geopolitics and they are dangerous in the conflict point between the mainland and western countries. And they have become danger for the mainland and have to be elimilated in the long run.\nPeople on Taiwan island want to become another England with island mentality, and provocate other countries to fight, then benefit from those.",

I don’t read their minds too.\nBut I have watched a video, in which a black girl tells her mother she wants to be a white because she thinks being a black is a shame.\nThe question is, why their pride depends on the ethnic root rather than their personal ability, manner, or thoughts.\nI guess they just love liberalism without understanding it…",

      "13": "OP is out of date with the history curriculum for high school in Taiwan.\nIn the most recent curriculum, Xia dynasty was taught as the first known dynasty of China but is still prehistoric, because there is no contemporary historical records about it discovered so far. All we know about Xia dynasty was written after the dynasty. So whether one counts Xia dynasty or not, that gives a maximum of 4200 years of Chinese history. If one starts with the next dynasty, Shang, that would be less than 4000 years.",
      "14": "I think Dawei Chen summed it up very nicely. But I’d like to add to it.\nTaiwanese people’s disdain towards the mainland is mostly a political one, but that explanation could only be used adequately in the contemporary era where the the culture and history of Taiwan and the Mainland have diverged to a degree significant enough that they could really be seen as separate nations states.\nBut its interesting to backtrack a little bit, to post-1949 years to really understand the collective psyche of Taiwanese people and how that has resulted in the contemporary stand off, and, superficially, contradictory mindset of Taiwanese people proclaiming heir to 5000 years of Chinese history.\nI think this is where all structured studies and scientific observations fail to do reality justice. When you are looking at a phenomenon this complex and one that conjures up so much sentimentality, you really have to look at writers, and how they portrayed the version of reality they witnessed. Pai Hsien-Yung 白先勇 is a Taiwanese writer, who was active mostly from the 70–80s. One of his most well read work is a series of short fictional stories collectively called the Taipei People or in Chinese 臺北人. The commonality between all these stories is that pretty much every character in the book has been part of the great evacuation from the Mainland in 1949, and fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-Shek, later settling in Taipei city. It described people of every single class - from the wives of influential elite who commanded The Bund in Shanghai during the Kuomingtang’s salad days, to the humble servants who tended to the lives of said elites and military generals and all the way to the ordinary people who were just lucky to have chose to flee the Mainland. Yet one thing was common between all of them - a nostalgia for the Mainland.\nIn most stories, the main characters all lament how things in Taiwan are “not as good as on the Mainland”, how the silk produced in Taiwan is rough on the skin, vinegar is not as rich, and wine is more scratchy on the throat than the ones produced on the Mainland. In short, there was a terrible nostalgia people felt for their days on the Mainland.\nAnd it must have been interesting to know what Pai was thinking when he wrote these stories. On the one hand, having been born in 1937 on the Mainland, he was in fact part of the evacuation from the Mainland and having been the son of a prominent military figure, he would have been in touched with the social classes of all his characters. On the other hand, at the time of the publishing of these stories, the Cultural Revolution was at full throttle on the Mainland, what could only be described as the greatest assault on human civilisation, culture and morality.\nHaving first witnessed the dilution of Chinese culture and history by fleeing to Taiwan, and now only to witness the last vestiges of Chinese culture being wiped from the Mainland and not being able to do anything about it - its must have been a complicated time to go through.\nAnd this was what all Taiwanese people were going through at that time.\nI think this is why, knowing that *China* is no longer the China they knew and loved, it was time to part way and dig out their own path. Initially, Taiwanese were unsure about their culture, unsure if what little they have brought with them from the Mainland could ever measure up to the former glory that China once held. But I think the utter destruction and alienation brought on by the Cultural Revolution was what propelled Taiwanese people to stop doubting their own heritage, however little of it is left, and instead embrace it, and accept that they alone now, could rightfully call themselves heir to this long history and tradition.\nOf course fast forward to contemporary era, neither Taiwanese or Mainlanders could ever call themselves “the rightful heir” to Chinese culture because culture is fluid, history is contextualised by the present. What exist on Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Macau are ALL Chinese culture, that much is indisputable. And if anyone is to call themselves “the rightful heir”, it only goes to show their narrow-mindedness, their blindness of the complexities of history, and often a glimpse into an ulterior agenda.",
      "15": "When Taiwan says they aren't Chinese, what they're saying is that they are not beholden to the current Chinese government. In fact many Taiwanese are fairly recent immigrants from China, mass migrating not more than one generation ago. The Taiwanese don't have a problem with the Chinese culture or history. They just have an entirely different view on democracy and modern economic goals. It's their right to be sovereign.",
      "16": "Because of weakness and incompetence.\nWhat they are doing now is similar to what Mainlanders were doing 20 years ago.\n20 years ago, Taiwanese had very few such voices but at the time most mainlanders insisted claiming Taiwan is part of China. Now more and more mainlanders have zero interest in doing that.\nThe reason is simple.\nMainlanders know it clearly no matter how you yell or shout, you have no power, you are incompetent and you are determined to change nothing and have to listen to mainland.\nTherefore what can you do?\nExcept getting angry and shouting, nothing will be done.\nThe reality is always that ugly.",
      "17": "I think it is perfectly clear, so clear that you can almost deduce it from the information you have put in your question.\nChinese people living in Taiwan do not very often want to be considered to be in cahoots with the mainland regime. Those who assumed that most of what they heard about mainland China from the establishment press in Taiwan was “propaganda” must have had to greatly revise their opinions and feelings when their own media controls were loosened at about the same time that news was first beginning to flood out of China about the terrible period called the Great Cultural Revolution.\nChinese people who came to Taiwan hundreds of years ago and who were probably not under very tight control in any of the time before the Japanese occupation did not like being under Japanese control (although I’ve heard more than one person say that street crime was virtually nonexistent because of harsh “justice” from Japanese police authorities). Their hopes of getting things under their own control after Japan was defeated were dashed when the KMT first took control over Taiwan following the war and then moved their center of government to Taiwan after being on the verge of being wiped out by the Chinese Communists. There was a great deal of fighting when some of the Taiwanese opposed the imposition of a government that they perceived as consisting of outsiders, and more than 18,000 Taiwanese were killed. (See Taiwan - Wikipedia (Taiwan - Wikipedia\n)). Many people deeply resented that tragedy.\nThose who felt deeply oppressed by the KMT regime did not rest easy with the KMT government, and in the present much more democratic polity that has evolved since around 1980 or 1985, those people have often not wanted to be considered to give tacit approval to mainland influence in the form of the ghost of the old KMT and maybe not even to the most recent political forces that harken back to those roots.\nOn the other hand, the culture of the aboriginal population of Taiwan did not gain wide appreciation among the ethnic Chinese. The cultural items that the Japanese left behind were, to my knowledge, fairly useful but superficial things such as leaving one’s street shoes at the door. Some Japanese popular songs were still selling records when I was there in the 1960s, but by the 1970s you were more likely to hear American blue grass music or rock and roll. There were some people who still practiced karate, but Chinese traditional martial arts were generally more popular. I can’t ever remember being offered sake to drink. Tatami mats were still widely available in the 1960s, and cost approximately one American dollar each. By the 1970s they were much harder to find, much more expensive, and, I suspect, widely replaced by other forms of floor coverings and sleeping surfaces. Other than those few items, I can’t think of much more of the Japanese cultural items that remained.\nOther than aboriginal cultural items, Japanese cultural items, and “tawdry” Western items such as rock and roll (and with Marxism at first being strictly beyond the pale because of Government controls and later being totally discredited by the various ways it had failed the people of China and the USSR), what cultural items were left for the people of Taiwan to claim as their own?\nWithout most people’s being aware of it, Confucian values were so deeply woven into Chinese culture that people very often do things “the Confucian way” without realizing that they are following one set of (excellent but still human-fabricated) cultural norms and ideals. To them they were just doing things “the normal way” or “the natural way,” and I’m pretty sure that upon observing Western people behaving in non-Confucian ways they probably regarded the behavior as bizarre at best and more usually just weird and/or abnormal. It wasn’t that there was a specific campaign to get things branded as abnormal, it was just that it was practically incomprehensible that things could be done otherwise. For instance, if they had observed a Western family severely chastising a parent for allowing a two year old child to drink a teaspoon full of unfortified wine at Christmas or Thanksgiving, most Chinese people might well have wondered what the big flap was all about. Why? Because wine in moderation is potentially a part of any meal, and a general item of hospitality at any party for friends or relatives, and an age-appropriate amount of wine is considered normal for everybody. A true Presbyterian, or somebody like my own mother, would throw a fit upon observing such behavior. The same would go if my mother (or most Western mothers I suspect) had seen a ten year old boy casually urinating into the gutter in front of a newsstand. More to the point, the instances of childrearing having to do with real crisis events that I happened to be privileged to observe generally followed “the Confucian way,” and the reason was generally that those people knew of no alternative ways of childrearing. You can trace them all back to Confucianism, but most people have not studied Confucianism in a deep and systematic way — except for those in the traditional society whose function it was to prepare themselves for potential government service or, if that didn’t work out, to educate the next generation in Confucianism. Most people got their Confucianism by cultural osmosis.\nOne of the most interesting experience I had with mainland Chinese occurred when I met one of the first 代表團 representative contact groups to visit the USA after the thaw. This must have been in 1987 or around that time. I happened to ask one of the Chinese visitors (in Chinese) what provisions were made for the elderly. I expected that they would receive accommodations in something like a commune. I was told that by law children were required to make provisions for their parents in their old age. I immediately thought to myself that not even in Taiwan was that Confucian way of honoring the needs of the aged carried out to that extent. Where did that law come from? I'm no expert on Marx or Lenin, but I'll bet there are no similar policies advocated by either writer.\nThe PRC requirements for parental care in old age are just right out of traditional Confucian values going all the way back to Confucius and Mencius. How did those values survive the decades in which the goal of the CCP was to utterly destroy all \"feudal\" ideas and values? I think people probably may have thought one way because their safety and acceptability required them to do so, their survival required them to do so, but they felt another way. That feeling could not be so easily rooted out.\nSociety in Taiwan is no less permeated by not only Confucian cultural items, but also Daoist and Buddhist values and ways of conceptualizing things.\nBecause of these cultural items that all people are immersed in, at a very minimum they at least know what they are expected by society to do even if they in fact do otherwise, the people cannot regard themselves as being other than Chinese in a cultural sense.",
      "18": "Before 1971, most Taiwanese considered themselves Chinese and their country—the Republic of China—was also considered the legitimate representative of China in the UN.\nAt that time, Taiwan had very close connection with the major countries in the world. It was common for Taiwanese to see their politicians sitting together with foreign politicians:\n1960, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chiang, Kai-shek in Taiwan\n1963, the Taiwanese Ambassador Shen, Chiang, Kai-shek’s son Chiang, Chin-kuo—Minister of National Defense of Taiwan, visited the US and has a meeting with President JF Kennedy.\n1971, King of Saudi Arabia(Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud) visited Taiwan\nLater, Taiwan was expelled out of the UN and lost the recognition from the most important allie—the US in 1979. The Taiwanese government’s reaction was changing its policy toward mainland China from using military force to “recover” the mainland to using “the Three Doctrines for the People” to united China. “The Three Doctrines for the People” is the political doctrine of the ruling party KMT(Chinese Nationalists). In other words, the young President Chiang, Chin-Kuo(CC) decided to focus on the economic development of Taiwan instead of spending huge amount of resources in military forces.\nCC’s policy toward the PRC was the three no’s—no contacts, no negotiations and no compromises. Although Taiwan—the Republic of China—was not recognized as China by major countries in the world then, Taiwanese were still educated that they were Chinese—or the chosen Chinese who were destined to recover the mainland and save the compatriots there who were suffering under the Chinese Communists.\nAt that time, China was not open to the world market yet. The wealth of Taiwan was two or three times that of China. Taiwan was also the largest single market of ethnically Chinese in the world. So, most Chinese outside of mainland(Hingkong, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.) showed their loyalty to Taipei rather than Beijing. Although Taipei failed in political power but still excels China in economic power at that time.\n1992, the movie star Jackie Chan was awarded “the extinguished Chinese young man in the world” by Taiwanese President Lee, Deng-hui. Today, Jackie Chan has turned his loyalty to Beijing and became a pro-Communists politician\n1988, famous movies stars from Hollywood visited Taiwan and attended the party with Taiwanese government officials. Brooke Christa Shields was shaking hands with the Taiwanese official Yu. Jackie Chan and many other movie stars were also there.\nTaiwan’s propaganda machine dominated the Chinese media till the 1990s. Below is a movie at that time about a story of a barve troop of the Chinese Nationalists left in mainland. In the left of the poster was Andy Lau, the most popular Hingkong movie star and male singer at that time.\nSo, till the 1990s, it was not too strange for a Taiwanese to considered himself/herself a Chinese. Because he/she was told in schools that he/she was a Chinese and many fomous persons all over the world, including his/her idols also told him/her that he/she was a Chinese.\nAfter the rising of the economy of China, Beijing changed the game rules. “The Republic of China” was not allowed to be shown in any places including enterprise webpages, posts, movies or clips unless explicitly saying it had been no more. Taiwanese people are considered as “separatists” if they claimed themselves the citizen of the ROC. The most famous one was the “Chou Tzu-yu flag incident”.\nChou, Tzu-yu is a Taiwanese girl who went to Southe Korea and joined a famous girl’s music band. In a commercial movie clip aimed to introduce the members of the band, she waved the national flag of the ROC showing that she was from Taiwan. It was in the year of 2015 and she was sixteen. Soon she was reported as a “separatist” and was demanded by the Chinese authority to apologize in public. Since this music band was aiming to Asia-Pacific market and China is obviously the largest part of it, she gave a speech in a press conference expressing her regrets to the Chinese people:\nIn this clip, Chou looked helpless and scarry. She said that there is only on China in the world and Taiwan and China is one unseparable nation. She was guilty for her bad behavior that violated this “fact” and hurt badly the feelings of Chinese people. She also said she was a Chinese and she was proud for being a Chinese, so she would never made the same mistake again.\nIt was absurd for a sixteen-year-old girl to utter these political language. Her “mistake” was to wave a flag of the nation she came from. This caused a huge negative influence on the youth generation of Taiwan. The voting rate of the youth generation of the Taiwanese Presidential Election that year was skyrocketing high. The pro-independent candidate Miss Tsai won the election by a landslide victory. Because for the youth generation, it became a shame to be a Chinese and they wanted to revenge for their idol.\nTaiwan has been expelled out of all of the major world organizations, including WHO(World Health Organization). In 2003, SARS occurred in Asia Pacific and Taiwan was not informed because it had been expelled out of WHO. Soon, Taiwan suffered huge losses in the pandemic but China’s response was: “Who cares?” Since then, Taiwan loss all faith on China. During the COVID-19 these years, Taiwan at the first moment rejected all the Chinese to enter Taiwan even though China claimed that COVID-19 was no big deal and was disappearing then.\nThe news report about the rejection of Taiwan’s application to be an observer in WHO. A Taiwanese journalist asked the Chinese officials: “Have you heard the need from Taiwanese people?” But the Chinese official angrily replied: “It was rejected already! …….Who cares!”\nThe efforts of China of preventing “the Republic of China” from appearing in the world caused Taiwanese lost the identity as a Chinese. The fact that the PRC is grabbing resources previously owned by the ROC in major world organizations cause Taiwanese consider China as enemy. Also, the democratization of China has become a failure cause Taiwanese ruled out the option of reunification with mainland.",
      "19": "I am Mainland Chinese, friend with many Taiwanese.\nWhen Taiwanese say “anti-Chinese”, the word “Chinese” is referring to PRC, or the mainland China, the PRC government in mainland China to be exact.\nHowever, a Taiwanese, by ethnicity, is Chinese, and has rightful claims to the long Chinese history, civilization, and culture.\nThe hate towards the mainland Chinese by Taiwanese is mostly political.",
      "20": "It is all about brainwashing(education).\nIf you teach the kids since the first day to school, that they are not Chinese, and it’s also written in every textbook that they are not Chinese, it will be the undoubtable belief in their mind. To set things back, it will take 1 or 2 generations of education.\nThe ultimate nature of education is brainwashing. I mean every country, and every education system is brainwashing, the difference is how you brainwash the kids, what do you want them to believe. It’s not just a China or Taiwan thing, the western education plays no differ.\nThe “Taiwanese” in your question are mostly under 30 years old, who have been deliberately engineered to think that way. Scientifically, no matter what they believe, they are Chinese, undeniably. The government can control their mind, but they can't control their DNA.",
      "21": "Please don't confuse nationality (real or disputed) with cultural identity. Chinese are everywhere, in Taiwan, in Japan, in Korea, in Southeast Asia, in Europe, in the USA, etc. I'm a US citizen, but I proudly claim 5000 years of Chinese history and culture. There is no confusion.\nThe issue with Taiwan is one of territorial integrity, which is an aspect of the more narrow concept of nationality. Culturally, if you are born Chinese, have a Chinese parent, or married to a Chinese, you are forever a Chinese, including your offsprings, for generations to come. For that reason, the people on the island of Taiwan have always been and will forever be part of the broader concept of Chinese.",
      "22": "Actually this question is a bit complex in the context of Taiwan. As I observe, most Taiwanese people indeed see themselves as ‘orthodox’ Chinese (I’m not sure whether I use this term correctly). That is to say, they see themselves as the legitimate successor of Chinese culture. This is because the CCP had destroyed much of the Chinese culture especially during the period of Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Besides, in my own view Taiwan has inherited and preserved most of the features of a traditional Chinese society when compared with China (let alone Hong Kong and Macau SAR which has a colonial background).\nTherefore, Taiwanese people who claimed that they are not ‘Chinese’ is usually in the narrow sense of China nationality, but not in the broader sense of Chinese ethnicity. In other words, they are merely attempting to distinguish themselves from people of mainland China. However, when Taiwanese people proudly claim the 5000 years Chinese history, they are saying it in the pure historical sense. To put it simple, they are referring to the historical origin of Chinese ethnicity and culture. There is nothing to do with the geographical term ‘China’. That’s all of my observation, thanks for reading.",
      "23": "NO,NO,NO, I’m afraid you make a mistake here. Now that Taiwanese do not think they are Chinese，they do not think the 5,000 years culture is Chinese culture too . They think the 5,000 years culture is Taiwanese culture，and what they proudly claim is their 5,000 years of Taiwanese culture.",
      "24": "The main reason for this is because the term “Chinese” has been confused with being a citizen of China, rather than being an ethnicity or heritage.\nTo put a stop to this confusion, there should be a new term to refer to the citizens of China. We should call them “Chinase”.\nTaiwanese are Chinese but not Chinase. Singapore has a majority of Chinese, and a small number of Chinase workers. Many Chinese do not agree with the opinion of the Chinase on China's policies.",
      "25": "I'm guessing the first Chinese means PRC as a country, and the second Chinese means the ancestry and culture.\nThe Chinese culture has never left, and it will never leave China. Culture stays where the people are. It is the 1.4 billion people who are the culture itself.\nAs a mainland Chinese I am proud and glad that my culture has so many subsidiaries.",
      "26": "I don't see a problem for many early White Americans to claim they are \"Not British\" but also claim they are proud decedents of the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Saxon Culture....\nMany Whites even still claim to be an Anglo-Saxon and their family left that land for over 300 years....\nI don't see a problem for Taiwanese to claim both \"Not Chinese\" and \"Proud of 5000 years Chinese History\" the same time.",
      "27": "It is exactly the same reason why American people insist on being considered “Not English” while they proudly claim 1300+ years of “English” (Anglo Saxon) history plus another thousand years or so of Greco-Roman history.\nHaving a common ancestry and language does not make you the same people. For most people, their identity is defined by National borders and political ideologies.\nTaiwan is not, and never will be, part of the Peoples Republic of China just as the Peoples Republic of China is not, and never will, be part of the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nThey may form a union at some point in the future but the nation will likely be called something different. United Republic of China perhaps?\nAmericans are not English even though they speak English and want to force everyone else to speak it. Canadians are not Americans even though they live in North America and Taiwan Chinese are not PRC Chinese even though they live off the coast of China and speak Chinese.. Got it?",
      "28": "Don’t blame the Taiwanese people. The current Taiwanese administration has been undertaking a master plan to remove Chinese heritage not favourable to its attempts to establish a new nation. They are now trying to tamper with Chinese history. Their efforts will be to no avail. People who deny their own ancestry will have no future under the sun.",
      "29": "They must mean “Not P.R.C. Chinese”.",
      "30": "They are still ethnic Chinese. The culture and civilization are their legacies too. If they claim so, nothing wrong with that.",
      "31": "They are all Chinese from same roots after all. But historical issues such as the conflict between mainland PRC vs republic of china made a distraction between them nationality wise.",
      "32": "It is not entirely their fault in the matter. I used to give tutoring to a mainland Chinese lady, who hailed from Henan. While communicating, she told me to refrain from identifying myself as a “Chinese”. She advised me to refer myself as an overseas Chinese, or a “_insert name of country_Chinese”. I feel so cold.",
      "33": "Easy to explain. USA was only born a couple of hundred years ago but Americans can still claim thousands of year civilization, dating back from Greeks or if they want, Egyptians.",
      "34": "because Taiwanese are proud of the independence that broke away from China. That part is emphasised and taken to pride the most, and then 5000 yrs of history comes 2nd to mind of Taiwanese identity",
      "35": "because Taiwanese were Chinese before the Chinese Civil War. They are the Republic of China which ruled China back before the Communist Party took over. They have every right to claim Chinese history because they are Chinese. Taiwanese is just a nationality. Chinese is the ethnicity.",
      "36": "Americans also insist on being considered \"Not English\",yet proudly claim a number of years of UK and Europe history.",
      "37": "As far as I am concerned, any Chinese could denounce being Chinese but there wouldn't be allowed to part with China’s sovereignty.",
      "38": "This question must be asked by a person who are not very well educated.\nChinese is both a Nationality and a Race.\nBy race, they are Chinese, but they are not Chinese by nationality.\nI am also an overseas Chinese. But whenever people ask, ‘are you a Chinese?’ I will also right away say, No. I am not.\nI am also proudly claimed the 500 years of Chinese, history, what is the issue with that?",
      "39": "The main issue is whether one view the term “Chinese” as an ethnicity (華人) or PRC nationality (中國人). The term “Chinese” is not very clearly differentiate in English language and has long been misused by various medias and political entities. For most Oversea Chinese communities including Taiwan, there is no much issue of recognizing as ethnic Chinese (華人), however most of them will not regard themselves as Chinese nationality (中國人). The five thousand years of Chinese Civilization is an inseparable part of all ethnic Chinese’s ancestry around the world, and do not belong to PRC or CCP alone. In my humble opinion, Oversea Chinese communities (including Taiwan) have preserved many important Chinese religious traditions and values that has been destroyed or dying out in mainland China during the devastating ten years of cultural revolution (文革).",
      "40": "This is a poor question. Non-indigenous Taiwanese consider themselves Chinese, just not communist, much like most Chinese over the world except for those living in China. So why can't they be proud of their heritage?",
      "41": "Taiwanese progress faster than Mainland after the separation.When you have made it you tend ro firget yiur roots",
      "42": "There’s a difference between shared culture and nationality.\nThey share culture with those on Mainland China, but they are not subject to the (present) government of China, which is ruled by the CCP, an authoritarian, genocidal government. Taiwan has a different government with its own nationality.\nCanada shares (some) culture with the United Kingdom and yet, Canadians have a government in Canada, which is not subject to the government in the United Kingdom (other than a respect for the queen).\nIt is that simple - so simple that most grade school children can comprehend it. No adult should be fooled by duplicitous definition games.",
      "43": "Not all, nor many, Taiwanese insist on being considered “Not Chinese.” I am a Taiwanese and a Chinese, a Virginian and an American; also an American veteran.",
      "44": "Things are different now, but the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan (the Republic of China) both considered themselves to be the one true China (some Taiwanese folks still believe this). In reality, there was a civil war, the KMT lost, and they fled to Taiwan. The tensions have lessened as time goes on, but there is still tension between native Taiwanese (both Indigenous communities and Chinese people who moved to the island centuries before) over their arrival and subsequent massacre of tens of thousands of people.",
      "45": "Because they are proud of the ethnicity that the majority of Taiwanese are but when they say they’re “not Chinese” because that is shorthand for, citizen of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). They are saying that ethnic-Chinese Taiwanese people are not and do not want to be citizens of the PRC. You are conflating two different things.",
      "46": "Every single Taiwanese merchant I met in Shanghai claims he/she is Chinese and tells that Taiwan should return to China.they don’t like dpp and Poor English.that’s what I am told and dont think these ppl are cheating me.",
      "47": "When immigrants from Taiwan in America speak of “going back,” it’s never to China, it is “回臺灣,” even amongst the second generation. We may be Chinese, ethnically and culturally, but we are not “Chinese” in sense that China is not “home.” From my parents’ generation and onward, most Taiwanese do not think of Taiwan as being part of a larger whole.",
      "48": "Those who really emphasis no“not being Chinese” are normally don't care too much about Chinese history let alone being proud of.",
      "49": "They are always proud to be real Chinese in history and progress in lifestyle\nThey just don’t want to be in the same place and be confused with those they believe are murder, lies, slaves, narrow, small, sick ... and gather all the bad habits exaggerated that they gave up 100 years ago in their national revolution.\nI don’t say I fully believe it. But the Taiwanese do. They look at the mainland government with hateful eyes, and pity the people of it.\nTaiwanese have a positive and progressive lifestyle that is easily recognizable. Relations are open, equitable, and democratic. In stark contrast to the situation of their brothers in the mainland.\nMaybe that is what makes their culture so progressive and positive. It is hard to see in mainland China under absolute communist control.",
      "50": "Ridiculous question. Taiwanese don’t claim 5000 years history. That’s a Communist Party thing to make out their party is a culmination of the longest continuous history (whatever that means). It’s complete ideological nonsense. They are Chinese, and perhaps the true heirs to the land we call China rather than the gangsters of the communist party. They don’t want to be considered mainlanders though as the mainland history is full of terrible decisions and an education system which has made them the self-entitled, arrogant people they are today. Taiwan on the other hand, has developed into an open and welcoming society where people show more real respect to one another, instead of respect to someone’s money."

    "answers": {
      "1": "provided it has a snorkel for fresh air to the engine and any electrics are sealed, then yes. I have seen army land rovers driving through water deep enough that the driver had to stand up to breath.. There was even an army Austin Champ modified with a compressed air bottle for the engine and the driver in a diving suite that was driven underwater for several hundred yards. Diesels have no spark plugs so no high tension electrics to short out.",
      "2": "Once a diesel engine in running, it doesn’t need any electricity to keep going.\nIf you have an older diesel car with no electronics to be shorted out by the water, so long as you keep the air intake above the water, it will run.\nA petrol engine needs the spark plugs to work- short those out and it stops. They can be sealed, but that seal is a point of potential failure.\nSo this isn’t a problem- any deeper and you’ll need a raised air intake.\nand afterwards you pressure wash the car, inside and out, so it doesn’t smell too much of mud.\nI try to avoid deep wading in mine- it is a working vehicle, not a toy!",
      "3": "Hitler’s tanks in WW2 ran exclusively on gasoline, and guess what; they were pretty good at fording rivers. In fact they could run while completely submerged except for the air intake. So in essence this isn’t true that gasoline engines cannot run underwater. However the basic principle is that gasoline engines are affected by water to a larger extent than the older diesel engines. Gasoline engines ignite their fuel using spark plugs which can easily be affected by moisture. Modern diesel engines employ a lot of electronics therefore these too can be affected by ingress of water.\nCopyright- momentnhistory",
      "4": "Ish.\nOld fashioned diesel engines have no electrics apart from the starter motor so, provided the air intake is out of the water (and has no leaks), they can continue running when submerged. Off-roaders tend to favour them for this reason.\nPetrol engines need an electrical ignition system so they cannot run underwater unless the ignition system is waterproof, which is likely to be impractical.\nBoth types of engine generally have electric starter motors so cannot be started underwater.\nModern engines of both types have electronic engine management systems so cannot run underwater unless that is waterproof, which is likely to be impractical.",
      "5": "I you are referring to standard cars/SUVs then older diesel vehicles without the electronics of modern vehicles can be fully immersed and still run. However, both type of engines are pretty much sealed and as long as the air intake is kept above the water, the exhaust maitains pressure and the electronics are water protected, then they’ll run underwater, diesels have less electronics so it is simpler to seal these. The US army used to issue sealing kits to enable the regular jeeps, trucks and even tanks to be driven completely submerged, something that was sometimes necessary during beach landings.",
      "6": "Hi, . . . A Petrol engine will be knocked out if water gets too near, or splashed on by the fan, to the ignition wiring for the spark plugs. . . . There is no such high voltage on Diesels. . . So now you are limited by other electrical systems, particularly the engine computer, if it is not 100% sealed. . . Then you are limited in water depth by the air intake. . . . Some vehicles have an air intake mounted high even above the cab.",

      "9": "An older diesel engine can run under water as long as the engine air intake is above water.\nA modern diesel engine would have issues as they're fitted with several sensors which would fail if submerged.",
      "10": ".\nAs long as the air intake is sealed and extended above the water along with the exhaust exit being extended you should be good in a diesel.\nThe exhaust if you can keep the revs up can get away with being submerged but extended is better as if the engine does stall the water can run up the pipe and into the cylinders that have open valves.\nGasoline engines can also be sealed but that requires sealing the ignition system completely including the distributor and coil and plugs. The intake and exhaust extenders are also critical.\nThe gasoline is much more susceptible to water intrusion at the electrical ignition points. The diesel not so much since it has not electrical ignition.\nNow do bear in mind that many modern diesels have computer systems to run cleaner and also change the lengths of the intake runners to increase torque at various RPM ranges. Do not get these systems wet and especially never submerge the computers.",
      "11": "Any internal combustion engine can run anywhere, provided the proper Air, Fuel, Ignition and Timing. My daughers mud truck gets buried in it, still pulls out of submergance everttime. But then again, I built the engine.",
      "12": "To a point, a diesel still has to be able to draw in fresh air. If the ignition components of a gasoline engine are sealed well enough it could operate if submerged but the same as a diesel, it has to have a snorkel for air to get in. No engine can run without air.",
      "13": "No.\nBoth can run under water if supplied with oxygen in the right format, neither can run if they can't breath.\nYou can use either a snorkel or onboard oxygen to run an internal combustion engine under water. On board oxygen would normally be in the form of hydrogen peroxide or something similar.\nIn most vehicles where you'd want to run an engine while submerged, diesel is a better choice than petrol for other reasons.",
      "14": "Simply put - NO. It will drown just like any air-breathing animal. It needs a source of fresh air. That is why swamp running and river crossing vehicles will have a snorkel that reaches up above the windshield. As long as that is above water and it is well sealed other than the inlet, the engine can run.\nNote that this simply means the engine will continue to operate. It doesn’t mean that having the vehicle submerged in 4 feet of water, sand, mud and other debris isn’t going to wreak havoc with the rest of the vehicle. The differentials, suspension, brakes, starter, etc can all easily be damaged as none of these are designed to operate underwater, or even to be water-tight.",
      "15": "Nope.",
      "16": "Q: Is it true that a diesel engine can operate underwater while a gasoline engine cannot?\nA: False, once water gets into the intake the engine shuts down and there could be catastrophic damage\nThere are thousands of off roaders who use their gasoline powered 4x4 to ford streams and narrow rivers where the water comes over the hood and they run just fine, its true that they tend to prepare the engine for use in water including getting a snorkel but the point is that that work and the diesel could just as easily short out one of its electric fuel pumps and shut down if its not properly prepared for fording bodies of water\nSo there is no difference between them",
      "17": "When one considers how a piston engine in an aircraft keeps working when flying through heavy rain then one can deduce that once the intake is provided with a good supply of air and perhaps the exhaust is also elevated above the water then I see no reason why a diesel and a gasoline engine cannot operate underwater. Obviously every unit must be watertight . The crankcae is normally uner pressure also so that will help too.\nThere are many competitions and even military vehicles that operate underwater and Russian trucks are well known for crossing flooded rivers and it is so surprising that they do so.\nSee Youtube Hummer H1 Off Road Driving COMPLETELY Underwater Experience!",
      "18": "No, they both need air (in particular oxygen) to run. Get water in the air intake and it’s a bad day for either engine and you."

Most people I know burgers were maybe weekly, if not bi-weekly or even monthly. Stats seem to suggest that for the average American it’s slightly more than once a week, but given there are almost definitely a contingent that eat way too many throwing that off, more likely for most people it’s a bit less than once a week, which I’d say is pretty accurate to my experience growing up.",
      "2": "They don’t, although I had a friend decades ago who ate a burger for supper every night, since his mother always let him eat one regardless of what she prepared for supper for the family.

      "9": "As a person that has experienced American culture people eat hamburgers often for two main reasons #1 they don't want to food or #2 it’s cheap. The sad concept in the U.S is that if you’re poor the food that’s cheap is in most cases very unhealthy. One of these foods is a hamburger.",

All the black people ordered a T-bone, well done. Go figure.",
      "3": "Well, a lot of American fine dining culture was basically imported from France. So, lots of middle class (and largely White) people learned an ethos of fine dining from another majority White country. Therefore, a lot of White people like steak rare (myself included). Some asian cuisines also prize rare steak but they might have learned it from the French, too–not sure about that.\nOther people, other places with other cooking techniques–have arrived at their own tastes regarding the cooking of beef. I have heard various explanations for these variations–(health, technology)–but I chalk it up mostly to taste and culture. Not everybody likes the same things.",
      "4": "EVERYONE that knows ANYTHING about beef orders it rare or medium rare.\nonly people who eat shoe leather orders it well done",
      "5": "It is not about race. It is about personal preference and to a lesser extent culture. In South Africa we all enjoy a barbecue (braai in the local vernacular) The requests for rare to well done does not depend on the colour of the person's skin",
      "6": "On average Black people tend to prefer well-done meat as they understand this lessens the risk of food-borne illness",
      "7": "Blacks like it that way, too. I know a number of Hispanic folks who like it rare, also. A few Asian guys I know like their steak rare as well.\nSome Native Americans & Mediterranean folks like their steak rare.\nWhat's with all this white bashing?",
      "8": "The idea that liking steak to be rare is a \"white thing\" is a stereotype and has no basis in fact. Preferences for how steak is cooked vary widely among individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. In some cultures, rare meat may not be preferred due to concerns about food safety, while in others it may be considered a delicacy. Ultimately, how people like their steak cooked is a matter of personal preference and has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.",
      "9": "Stop hanging around white people if you think all their behaviors have anything to do with skin color, genius.",
      "10": "It isn’t. Stop injecting race into places it doesn’t belong. Steak is to be enjoyed by everyone. Get your head out of that gutter, and go for a walk. Maybe to talk to some people. Or just sit in nature.\nAnything other than this.",
      "11": "The correct answer to you asking (honestly) has everything to do with your skin color.\nIf you're are white. This is a lie lots of people like steak lots of different ways. Who ever told you this is misinformed.\nIf you are not white. Same answer.",
      "12": "Well I am white and i never eat steak rare. There is no connection between those two things.",
      "13": "It goes back to the stone age when one fellow started cooking meet and the other guy said to his buddies.” Look what Grog do”. Beer was developed shortly afterward and its been all downhill from there",
      "14": "Not a white thing. I was born in Taiwan. It’s very tasty. I prefer it rare. It’s super juicy and very meaty flavor.",
      "15": "I don’t know that the premise is true.\nFor myself, anything from medium rare to well done is fine.",
      "16": "No its a not liking g though steak thing to like medium rare steak raw steak is very hard to crew",
      "17": "It isn’t. many people like steak ‘rare’. It is largely generational. I know the two prior generations of my family did NOT like any meat rare.",
      "18": "Actually it’s more of a “taste thing.” People of all races like all sorts of different things.\nThis question is more of a “stupid thing.”",
      "19": "It's not an any colour thing, why do you racists bring racism into everything?\nIf steak cannot be eaten rare it's stewing steak.\nIf it's any good all that cooking will do is make it tougher.\nThat's why you eat fillet steak raw.",
      "20": "Sorry- but it has little to do with color- and everything with the community you have been growing up.\nFor example communities which have a background with Caribbean, Middle Eastern - but also often African roots- have a tendency to avoid any red meat “juices”. Obviously this has sometimes to do with hygiene (especially in those countries refrigeration has been just rather recent - plus temperatures were quite high).\nA lot of communities also don’t necessarily have the culture of specific cuts of meat. Hence meat was just chopped up- and this means, that the meat becomes just really edible if it is well-well cooked.\nBut these traditions or sentiments are also apparent of both sides: modern cooking techniques allow better results when most steaks are medium-rare. Because the temperature is more pleasant, you have less of a meat “gradient”, the fat is better rendered and the meat is more tender. Despite that a lot of people stuck to rare cooked steaks. As said, it is all about how we grew up and how we deal with traditions.\nBut I also work for more than 2 decades in hospitality and can definitely attest, that there are plenty of “non-white people” who like their steak medium rare - and a lot of “white people” who like it well done!",
      "21": "The association between white people and a preference for rare steak is a stereotype and not accurate for all individuals. Preferences for the level of cooking steak can vary among people of different races, ethnicities, and cultures. It is important to avoid generalizations and understand that food preferences are shaped by various factors such as personal taste, cultural background, and individual experiences.",
      "22": "It has been a long time since I’ve eaten steak, due to the cost of that meat. But I like my pork chops medium well. With pork chops I usually eat parbroiled rice or mashed potatoes (new potatoes cooked with the skin on and mashed up with a fork with butter). I cook smoked sausages cut in half lengthwise until they are slightly burned on the cut side and singed on the skin side. I typically eat the sausage links in sandwiches on whole wheat bread with mustard, black pepper, spinach leaves and/or bits of onion and bell pepper, with a well done fried triple egg with melted cheddar cheese on the side, and black coffee (Ethiopian Sidamo medium roasted beans 3 parts, Starbucks Italian roast 1 part) brewed in a moka pot.",
      "23": "It's not. I love my steak rare. But then, I can afford to buy in great markets. If I lived in a food desert, I wouldn't eat anything rare or raw.",
      "24": "I was introduced to rare steaks in Paris, while I was stationed in Europe in the late 1950’s.\nOur mother always cooked steaks, well done. After my visit to Paris, I have always ordered my steaks, medium rare.",
      "25": "Because typically (In my case) White people tend to have a bit more of a chance to be born extremely well off for all of their childhood, and the parents have high stereotypical (but true) chances for skills or picking up something, like white dads with grilling, football, etc.",
      "26": "It's a black thing. You got it backwards. They (crackers) cook it overly for fear of infecting themselves. While blacks, always on the run, have little time to slow cook it enough, and end up eating raw meat sometimes. Geesh, you'd think you'd have known that!",
      "27": "I don’t know. This administration is going to make steak so rare, that no one remembers what it is."

    "answers": {
      "1": "Although I am not yet 70 (I have 30 years to go), I work with and treat many who are, as I work in the operating room. I see many hip replacements, broken ankles, gallbladder and kidney stone removals, cancer biopsies, and illnesses of all kinds. I’m constantly learning how to avoid the pitfalls of age-related disease, how to be as healthy as possible, and how to enhance one’s quality of life, especially as we get older.\nDo not stop moving - it’s important to maintain mobility! Whatever you do, just keep walking, it’s so essential for your cardiovascular system and bone health and at the same time, not too strenuous on your joints. No need to win marathons, rather just get up and move. You don’t want to be frail and have to do a hip replacement at the age of 90. I learned in nursing school that once an older adult falls, their mortality rate increases by at least 20% because they stop walking, as they are afraid to fall again thereby they begin to lose muscle, bone mass, circulation, etc. creating a vicious cycle of weakening their physical health. Walking, gardening, swimming, tai chi, line dancing, there are many low-impact activities to do that can enrich your physical health. Take care not to do anything too daring that may break your bones (ie. skateboarding, skiing, horseback riding). If you take away anything from this, I cannot stress enough that mobility is the key!\nDo not stop learning - if you don’t use it, you lose it, which is exactly what happens to your brain. You need to keep making new neural connections and sharpen your brain’s ability, aka neuroplasticity. Always try to learn something new every day and if possible, take classes. You can learn a new instrument online! You can audit university courses! You can take up a new hobby like photography or woodwork, and learn how on YouTube. At the same time, learning gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\nDo not stop caring about your health. You have many more years to live, how do you want to feel each day? You need good health to feel good. There are many things to do in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat fresh, unprocessed food for maximum nutrient intake, limit sugar and seed oils, limit processed foods, take care of your gut microbiome with fermented foods. Lift weights to maintain your muscle and bone mass (we lose 10% muscle mass per decade). Wear sunscreen, protect your skin. I suppose these tips on health could apply to any age, but perhaps even more so for older adults as the body isn’t functioning as it used to when it was a teenager. I myself follow these rules, I limit sugar, processed foods, limit seed oils, and do my best to eat fresh, unprocessed food. I make my own yogurt and berry jam, I always eat a cup of raspberries as a snack for antioxidants and fibre. Same goes for sunscreen and weights. I recommend going to the doctor and getting tested for any issues, and ask how you can proactively improve your health. For example, if you have urinary retention, if you are a male, do you need to check your prostate? If you are a female, do you need to take more D-mannose to decrease UTI symptoms? How is your weight? Many diseases are exacerbated by higher BMIs. It’s also at this age where your health shows your lifestyle habits from your younger years, as well as any genetic predisposition to certain diseases.\nHere’s to living well at any age :)",
      "2": "Avoid looking weak. Seniors are prey to some rotten people. If you can't physically protect yourself carry multiple self defense weapons. I carry a torch lighter as one cuz if someone knocks me down im not getting up…im going to remain laying on the ground and light your pants, shoes, etc on fire.\nAvoid people that ask for money. IDK they have a sad story. You might never be able to recoup your money back in your lifetime. Giving money to others is over.\nAvoid doing what other people say you should be doing. You've made it to 70. There is some common sense there. Do what you want.",
      "3": "What three things should a person do when they’re past 70? (I live by every one of these, and my extended family really appreciates it.)\nBe really, really nice. The older you get the more like yourself you become. Avoid being not nice! Seriously, personalities get amplified with age. As your mind weakens, you don’t want to be that old person that people just don’t want to have around. Be nice!\nBe around young people. I’ve been substitute teaching for 22 years since I retired. I’m in really tough schools. But this keeps me young. It’s amazing to have kids into their 30’s come up, and tell me how much they appreciate having had me in school.\nBe active until your body stops you. My hobby is hiking. I hike 3 or 4 times a week - snow, rain, 0 or 90 degrees F here in the Midwest where I live. Enjoy your neighborhood and nature. Most Medicare plans cover rec centers. Join one!\nThese are a few bonus picks:\na. Say hello to everybody. Seriously, buck the trend of silence. Force yourself to smile and say “hi”.\nb. Have lofty goals, and attack them a little bit at a time. Start lifting with 1 pound weights. Walk a few hundred yards. Slowly over months and months of consistent workouts increase the amount you do.\nc. If you have an injury, it might take a year of daily exercises to get back in shape. Make your physical therapy count. Physical therapy works if you religiously keep at it. (Sometimes PT’s push too hard. Talk to them, and they’ll work with you.)\nd. Be inquisitive. There is so much to see, do, and learn.\ne. Be nice. Did I say that already? It doesn’t matter. Force yourself to be nice.\nEdit: As we age, we reach a point where we want to remain independent, but we are losing the ability to handle complex situations well. I am 75 years old, and I will soon be needing somebody to advocate for me in the medical system. Before I had an optional spinal fusion at 68 years, I made a point to solicit advice from my children and a few relatives. We made a “group” decision. Get in the habit of involving those younger than you in your medical decisions.\nLearn to trust and have faith in your loved ones when dealing with your independent living and medical issues. I’ve experienced too many cases where this didn’t happen, and it didn’t work out well - physically for the senior and emotionally for the family. Don’t be too independent!\nEdit 2: If you want things to avoid, change the three to “avoid not being nice…” Seriously, I just don’t “avoid” too many things that would apply to most people. I binge on my home made blackberry pie. So I wouldn’t list “avoid over-eating”. In the tough schools I’m in, I try to make a difference with some very tough teens. (This is as much for me as the students.) So I really can’t advise avoiding being around tough, mean, disrespectful…people.\nFrom a general perspective, most of what I say should apply to all. However, my specific actions don’t. Extreme hiking is my hobby. It affects my medical decisions and exercise routine. However, consistency of exercise and taking baby steps in expanding your routine should apply to most.",
      "4": "My top 3.\nAnd I’m north of the 10th anniversary of my 50th birthday. Somewhere, I’m just not sure.\nFirst, acting old. Most people hit 70 and suddenly start acting old. They eat early bird dinners. They don’t drive at night. They can’t go for a long walk. They’re retired but can’t return phone calls. And pretty soon they start looking old and walking old.\nInstead, forget about your age. Do everything you should have been doing at 40 to stay in good health. Then keep doing all the things that you used to enjoy and slowly gave up. And most of all stop acting and looking old. Seriously, it’s not a good look.\nSecond, thinking old. Most people hit 70 and mentally give up. They retire so they can do, well, nothing. They spend hours watching mindless TV and then can’t remember what was even on. As well as what they walked to the bedroom to get.\nInstead, keep your mind active. If you have a job you like keep working. If you retire then recreate your life into something meaningful. Oh, and turn off the TV. Believe me, you won’t miss anything. And you just might start remembering stuff like what was in the bedroom.\nThird, speaking old. Most people hit 70 and start talking old. They’re always saying, “Oh, I’m too old for that.” Or constantly telling you about their aches and pains and how old they feel. And you know what, as they constantly remind themselves they start believing it.\nInstead, never utter the words, “I’m old.” I don’t care how old you are. And purposely forget when you were born so you can’t remember your age. Then do the things you like and never speak of age again. You’ll surprise yourself and frankly shock others. It’s fun.\nA friend of mine, who is a bit older than me, has a bumper sticker on his BMW M5 which says, “Growing old is mandatory, acting old is optional.”\nMy philosophy of life even if sometimes I do forget what I went to the bedroom for.\nYou’ll age successfully but only as you purposefully forget your age.",
      "5": "I'm 74 and many years ago I was given these three things to do by a physical therapist.\nWhatever you do today, do tomorrow meaning walking, eating health, reading etc\nMake adjustments like with stairs make sure you don't stop doing dany stairs at all. You never know when you might have to do a few.\nDon't be prideful in asking for help when you really need it.\nHope this helps others.",
      "6": "I’m over 70 so I’ll offer a few bits of advice:\nDon’t sit around - exercise like your life depends on it (it does). If you don’t do this your aerobic fitness will degrade, you’ll get weaker, and your joints will get stiff. I know this because I started exercising heavily when I retired and after 10 years of feeling great I took a month off due to an injury and boy did I notice the difference.\nA corollary of 1. - Know your limits and don’t exceed them. A serious muscle strain will take a long time to recover from. Last December I lifted my 250 lb snowblower up some stairs (it was running so it did part of the work). This was something I had done hundreds of times in the past but this time the strain really did some damage which has taken me more than 2 months to recover from. Over 70 you really aren’t a spring chicken\nAvoid loneliness. Stay involved in life. Volunteer your time, meet up with friends, do some new activities where you meet new people. Interaction with others really enriches your life (and hopefully theirs).\nWhen you hit 70 you become more aware that your life’s runway is short. Treat every new day as the gift that it is.",
      "7": "My mother and her friends avoided only one thing when they were that age : getting married.\nThey said that any man their age who wanted to get married either was after their money or wanted a nurse.",
      "8": "I like some of these answers, they are funny.\nWell, I’m not close to 70 at this point, but if I were, this is what I’d avoid:\nPeople who would tell me what is appropriate for my age. Everyone is an individual, even 70 year olds. If I enjoy going out, fine. If I like wearing certain outfits, fine. If I like doing certain activities, fine. If the only reason you are telling me I can’t do certain things is because I am a certain age, and there is no other concrete reason for it that goes to my individual capabilities, then just keep moving.\nPeople who are negative. I want to enjoy life, no matter how old I get, and a lot of people as they get older just get crankier. Don’t want to be surrounded by negative energy in my twilight years.\nAnything that they don’t enjoy. I hope that when you get to 70, you have the ability to just say no to stuff you don’t want to do, whether it be working full time, putting up with people who you don’t have to take care of, activities you no longer enjoy. I certainly want a life of peace when I get that old, that’s for sure.",
      "9": "Having reached that milestone less than a year ago, here are my suggestions (I decided five was better than three):\nLimit sex to a couple times a week. It’s still fun, just more tiring. When my wife and I engage in an afternoon delight, I often need a nap afterwards, and my sleep/wake schedule gets totally messed up.\nEverything in moderation. Eating, drinking, exercise, everything. I’ve been to emergency rooms twice recently for doing things that were easy 25 years ago. Once I was doing gymnastic stunts on the streets of Chicago when I landed on my face. The other time I was single handedly fighting off an alien invasion of the planet (OK, they are making me say I fell off a ladder while trimming a tree in the front yard. Like anyone will believe that!).\n3. Scammers. They love old people. I will sometimes listen to their pitch, then tell them I am very interested, but first they need to shove a baseball bat up their ass. That generally ends the conversation.\n4. Sugar. I used to live on it. I could eat a half pound bag of M & M’s at one sitting with no problem. Now even a Starbucks frappuccino makes me somewhat sick to my stomach. I’m probably better off.\n5. Anything you don’t enjoy. I now have a housecleaner and a gardener. I have little interest in spending the limited time I have left doing either housecleaning or gardening. If you enjoy those, great! Otherwise, just take it out of your children’s inheritance.",
      "10": "Avoid pretending you are not old. Sorry, you are. Your joints tendons ligaments muscles and bones are over 70. HOWEVER, you can and should exercise smartly to maintain and build on what you are capable of doing. Keyword is smartly.\nAvoid isolation. Do things with others. Bonus tip, kill two birds with one stone by joining an age appropriate fitness class.\nAvoid being stubborn. It’s not and expression of individuality. Considering seriously the advice of experts and actually take it, or at least try it.",
      "11": "A doctor’s advice:\nAvoid eating raw fish and eggs to avoid salmonella poisoning.\nAvoid clams, mussels, shelled seafood to avoid red tide poisoning.\nAvoid falls so do not attempt to change that ceiling bulb/light.

      "13": "Keep listening to your heart (and body). Have your heart, prostate and colon checked before they check you. (If you don’t have a prostate, skip the digital rectal check.)\nDo not stop reading. Keeping your mind active and healthy is as important as physical exercise. If your mind breaks down, it will pull everything down with it. Also, keep using the internet and your cell phone — your world is getting smaller, and these things keep you connected to the world. (Just ease a bit on the adult sites.)\nStop doing those handstands. You are past 70 now, and you have nothing to prove.

This means that you will for sure die a lot younger.\nRead a lot - study a lot and your brain will also get younger.

      "15": "Smoking anything. Inhaling smoke of any kind subjects your body to smoke inhalation, something for which people are treated in hospitals.\nAlcohol. Even one daily drink has an impact over many years. That impact is greater when you are older. Besides, alcohol stupifies your brain — makes you dumb so that you cannot think quickly and will make bad decisions. One of those decisions could result in your falling and breaking bones. Your impaired coordination, already declining, could do the same thing. You don’t have to drink. The same thing goes for every recreational drug you can buy.\nIndolence. Do not be lazy. I know how it feels to be old. I am 80. Staying active is not easy. It takes determination and willpower. The alternative is worse. It’s not that you’ll die sooner; it’s that you’ll be sickly sooner. Keep your brain active too.\nOf course, the list can be much longer. For example, avoid physically dangerous activities. Let the youngsters who heal quickly have them. You have no need for them.\nGet plenty of sleep and wake up with a purpose.",
      "16": "Avoid having sex every day. If you are a woman, it’s okay to cut back to only one to three times a week. Male partners probably can no longer make Old Faithful go off more than that, anyway. Otherwise, you might have to find a much younger partner, and that’s probably NOT a good idea. After you past 70 you should not have an extra-marital affair because it’s time to stop sinning and prepare for eternity. Who wants to wrap your body around a bunch of sagging skin and extra blubber, anyway? Read some good books instead.\nAvoid eating in restaurants too often. It’s so much easier to take your 30 vitamins, prepare your nutritious drinks and stick to a healthy diet if you cook your own meals at home. When you eat at home, you will also be much closer to a bathroom and you’ll have a much better chance to get to it on time under very short notice.\nAvoid being over-medicated whenever possible. Also avoid getting into knock-out fights with doctors trying to push unnecessary medications on you to help drug companies get rich. Look for healthy, natural cures that work, keep records of your success, and find a doctor who will work with you. For example, eating beets helps many people get their blood pressure down to normal because beets help open our veins and arteries. If you don’t like the taste of beets, try the beet chews. They taste like candy.",
      "17": "WHAT THREE THINGS SHOULD A PERSON AVOID WHEN THEY ARE PAST 70?\nI don’t know what men over 70 should avoid so can only speak as a 73 year old woman. Bear with me.\nThe first thing to avoid is parties.\nAvoid parties at all costs. It doesn’t matter what kind of party you are invited to, or who you should be trying to please, if you accept the invitation and go to a party you will live to regret it.\nYou will be completely stuck when it comes to what to wear. Your wardrobe that’s now filled with flowery, long sleeved shirts that cover your wobbly arms, far-too-tight polyester pants that ride up your bum when you walk, and silly, peaked caps in various renderings of red, white, and blue are just not suitable to wear at parties. And none of your 20 pairs of ‘sensible’ shoes will look good with anything.\nDon’t even think about what to do with your hair. Now that you can see your scalp shining through your thinning gray bob, and it is not long enough to hide your turkey neck or to cover your multi-lined cleavage it is just a no-hoper.\nMake-up, as you know by now, is a disastrous forgone conclusion. It just will not work. If you don’t wear any you will disappear into the woodwork, and if you do have the guts to deck yourself out in your gold, sparkling eye shadow and your new red blush you will only look like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and be put to work to keep the kids happy.\nSo parties are out.\nThe second thing to avoid is kids.\nKids of all descriptions are no longer good for the constitution.\nEven though they may be your own grand kids, and even if they are the nicest kids on the block they will be constantly at you, ‘Grandma, come and play on the swings with me’. Or, ‘Grandma, come and play a video game with me,’ or ‘Grandma, come and play electric trains’.\nFirst of all, you will want to take your nap. Nobody disturbs your nap. And secondly, you will not be able to get your bum in between the handles of the swings, you will not be able to make head nor tail of a video game - what are they anyway? and if you are foolish enough to get down on the floor to play with electric trains they will have to hire a crane to get you up.\nNo kids are definitely out.\nThe third thing to avoid is holidays.\nIf you think in your wildest dreams that you will be able to enjoy a road trip, think again. Do you really want to be sweating for 10 hours in 90 degree heat in traffic jams, or maybe trying to read a road map with your bifocals sliding down your nose in the heat, or your unreliable bladder suffering in silence between rest areas? I think not.\nAnd Disney World with the kids? OMG! Do you really want to stand in wavy lines that double back on each other, then double back on each other again, then double back ….. or slump around, sweat dripping off your chin holding your cotton candy, or all but lose consciousness on the big dipper rides? I don’t think so.\nAnd if you think it would be nice to visit Aunty Maud in Australia, brace yourself. When they say you will be in ‘coach’ don’t imagine you will be able to get out and stretch your legs to avoid a blood clot, or that you will be able to lie back in your seat without your chair ending up in somebody’s dinner, or that you won’t be totally comatose for two days with jet lag when you get there.

      "23": "WHAT THREE THINGS SHOULD A PERSON AVOID WHEN THEY ARE PAST 70?\nI don’t know what men over 70 should avoid so can only speak as a 73 year old woman. Bear with me.\nThe first thing to avoid is parties.\nAvoid parties at all costs. It doesn’t matter what kind of party you are invited to, or who you should be trying to please, if you accept the invitation and go to a party you will live to regret it.\nYou will be completely stuck when it comes to what to wear. Your wardrobe that’s now filled with flowery, long sleeved shirts that cover your wobbly arms, far-too-tight polyester pants that ride up your bum when you walk, and silly, peaked caps in various renderings of red, white, and blue are just not suitable to wear at parties. And none of your 20 pairs of ‘sensible’ shoes will look good with anything.\nDon’t even think about what to do with your hair. Now that you can see your scalp shining through your thinning gray bob, and it is not long enough to hide your turkey neck or to cover your multi-lined cleavage it is just a no-hoper.\nMake-up, as you know by now, is a disastrous forgone conclusion. It just will not work. If you don’t wear any you will disappear into the woodwork, and if you do have the guts to deck yourself out in your gold, sparkling eye shadow and your new red blush you will only look like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and be put to work to keep the kids happy.\nSo parties are out.\nThe second thing to avoid is kids.\nKids of all descriptions are no longer good for the constitution.\nEven though they may be your own grand kids, and even if they are the nicest kids on the block they will be constantly at you, ‘Grandma, come and play on the swings with me’. Or, ‘Grandma, come and play a video game with me,’ or ‘Grandma, come and play electric trains’.\nFirst of all, you will want to take your nap. Nobody disturbs your nap. And secondly, you will not be able to get your bum in between the handles of the swings, you will not be able to make head nor tail of a video game - what are they anyway? and if you are foolish enough to get down on the floor to play with electric trains they will have to hire a crane to get you up.\nNo kids are definitely out.\nThe third thing to avoid is holidays.\nIf you think in your wildest dreams that you will be able to enjoy a road trip, think again. Do you really want to be sweating for 10 hours in 90 degree heat in traffic jams, or maybe trying to read a road map with your bifocals sliding down your nose in the heat, or your unreliable bladder suffering in silence between rest areas? I think not.\nAnd Disney World with the kids? OMG! Do you really want to stand in wavy lines that double back on each other, then double back on each other again, then double back ….. or slump around, sweat dripping off your chin holding your cotton candy, or all but lose consciousness on the big dipper rides? I don’t think so.\nAnd if you think it would be nice to visit Aunty Maud in Australia, brace yourself. When they say you will be in ‘coach’ don’t imagine you will be able to get out and stretch your legs to avoid a blood clot, or that you will be able to lie back in your seat without your chair ending up in somebody’s dinner, or that you won’t be totally comatose for two days with jet lag when you get there. Plane trips to Australia, or even to Hawaii, are a disaster waiting to happen.\nHolidays of all descriptions are definitely out.\nSo now that you have decided not to go to parties, not to have anything to do with kids, and not to even think about leaving home, what’s left?\nThat’s a silly question - you just grab your old man by the pants, of course, and drag him upstairs to make hay while the sun shines.\nEDIT I wanted to know what had happened to this one!

Instead I recommend buying what you want and enjoying your golden years. If I die with money in the bank I'm gonna be pissed. I worked for it and I'm gonna enjoy it. Fuck the grandkids. They have parents who were raised by me so I know they will be just fine.\nAnd I won't preach abstinence from anything. ANYTHING!! I'm over 70 and I'm going to enjoy what's left of my already colorful life. Sex, drugs and rock n roll, brothers and sisters. My doctor told me that if I quit smoking I would add ten years to my life.

But I'm going out on MY terms and making MY decisions pertaining to MY life. But his way, I would have to go ten years without a cigarette. Fuck that.\nSo instead of three things to avoid, I support an end involving wonton hedonism, irresponsible spending, and to a certain degree, gluttony and conspicuous consumption. I've worked hard all my life to amass the bankroll I have, and I've toed the line and avoided the pitfalls of failure to get here. Now I'm old and ready to finally live. The way I choose to live, and that is following only one rule. I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations, and you're not here to live up to mine.

      "31": "The first thing is to not talk about yourself in a negative way, so don’t refer to yourself as “old” regardless of your age. There’s a lot of negativity about being older so don’t add to it. We need to change that narrative. I hear older people say they can no longer do something they used to be able to do and blame it on their age. In fact, they can’t do that something because they have allowed their body to deteriorate so they can’t move as well as they used to. Decline in old age is not a given, we can work on it so that it doesn’t happen.\nThe second thing to avoid is hard and fast routine. Having a routine is good for us, it helps our mental health and means we remember to do everything we need to do. However, sometimes we should do something new and challenge our brain. Taking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, cleaning our teeth with the opposite hand will challenge the brain, building new neural pathways that prevent atrophy, leading to dementia.\nThirdly, avoid processed foods. We need to be as healthy as we can be in older age and processed foods are bad for us. Foods that are simple and nutritious ensure our body is functioning well. The Mediterranean way of eating is the most healthy, science tells us and that means extra virgin olive oil (no seed oils and little butter), grains, nuts, beans, legumes, sea food, mainly plant based, vegetables, fruit, with spices and herbs.\nI’m 76, fit and healthy, and have written a book about my own aging process guided by science.

      "41": "I'd say these are: excessive physical activity, stress and alcohol/nicotine consumption.\nAs for the excessive physical activity, then I underlined \"excessive\" cause physical activity itself is recommended for those who are over 70s.

It's mandatory in case you don't want feel pain any time you move your limbs. For sure, it's also recommended to run a healthy lifestyle even if you don't hit a retirement age as it's influential from the point of your mobility, you know.\nStress is the catalyst of dozens of different diseases and we all know that old people are more susceptible to having diseases connected with the cardiovascular system. They oftentimes have a worse blood circulation, problems with vessels and their ability to pump blood from the head and to the heart and back. Thus, sometimes there are stressful situations which may cause heart attack or stroke. That's why complete elimination of stress is recommended. Surround your granny/grandaddy with care and peace. It's important as hell.\nI don't see much point in describing why alcohol and nicotine are contraindicated for those who have already turned 60-70. It's obvious enough that their damageous influence will bring nothing but worsening of the overal situation with the health. Organism is no longer durable to different chemicals entering the body.

It should read ‘what should a person (i) avoid, and (ii) what would they like to avoid, but can’t?\nA large number of the characteristics of 70 year olds is all that took place in the preceding 70 years. It’s my observation that children visit their ageing mothers far more frequently than they visit their ageing fathers.\nWhen people reach the age of 70, they are more prone to physical injury, dementia, putting on needless amounts of weight and suffering irregular sleep patterns.\nThe situation is different for married couples, widowed spouses, and single people.\nSo, the three things that old people should avoid are:\n1. letting the house get in an awful mess.\n2. neglecting one’s personal hygiene\n3. giving up on romance.\nMeeting someone you can form a relationship with goes a long way to mitigating all three.\nI recently met a very attractive and affable Chinese woman who is several years my junior. By sheer chance she happens to live close by. She cannot speak English, which at first sight might appear to be an impediment, but it turns out that Google translate enables us to communicate. Indeed,she can paint Chinese symbols on her phone which get translated to audible English, quite amazing.\nOf course, this only works when you have access to wi-fi, but it’s amazing what you can do when you can’t talk to each other.\nFinally, what would old people like to avoid, but can’t.\nI would like to think that I avoid foods that aren’t good for me, but every now and again I get this urge for apple pie and ice cream.\nI recently developed a taste for prawn curry, but then my daughter told me that prawns belong to the crustacean family and are high in cholesterol.\nI try to avoid not eating simply because I don’t feel hungry.\nI would like to avoid not cooking meals with fresh ingredients, but unfortunately, Sainsbury do these really tasty meals for one, but one day I really would like to make my own spaghetti bolognaise with onions, peas, mushrooms, carrots, just like I did when I had kids to feed.",

I’m busier than when I had a full-time job. It’s still winter, so I’m not as active as during the other three seasons, especially since I haven’t had to shovel the driveway or walks this year…no snow. Aside from household chores that I do to free up my wife so she can concentrate on her Doctoral, I lift about 18,000 lbs of weights 3–4 times a week, and am on the treadmill for 40–50 minutes 6 times a week. I have some arthritis in my shoulders, so much of the weight lifting is light stuff, but a LOT of reps.\nA few months ago we calculated how far we walked when we went grocery shopping. Because the Krogers we shop at keeps changing the location of everything every few months, we figured it’s about a 2 mile walk around the aisles just to find what’s on the list. That includes the walk to and from the store, as we park a good ways from the entrance.\nThings are warming up, so soon I’ll be outside getting the yard ready for summer. We have LOTS of plants to tend, clean up the old mulch and leaves that didn’t get raked last fall, get the mower and weed wacker ready, power wash the patio, set up and clean all the lawn furniture and gas grill that have been stored in the garage.\nThen there’s the summer projects like doing some body work I missed on my truck, and tearing apart and rebuilding the gun cabinet I made in 8th grade shop class.\nMy brother is confined to a wheel chair, but that doesn’t stop him. He’s 68, and still runs his Pest Control business, babysits his grandchild, cooks, and other household chores. He’s hardly ever NOT doing something.\nYeah, I’m 70, and slowed down some, but it doesn’t mean I’m going to sit around and wait for the grim reaper to visit me.",

People who are close to or in their 70s are a diverse bunch—some are very fit, some are still working, some are retired, some have health problems, and some just sit around and complain.\nI figure I’m credible in this subject—in a few months I will be 70. Last fall, I celebrated with other geezers at our 50th high school reunion. I also was dancing it up on December 31st with my spouse at a local New Year’s Eve “roaring 20s” party, where we both drank a lot of champagne and had fun (and stayed at the venue to nearly 1 am on January 1st, even after many a younger person had left, before we walked back to the hotel where we were staying).\nIt is true i can’t do everything as easily as I once did. My bones creak, getting up off the floor is a trick, and my health is not quite as good. But I put some of that down to not always eating right or exercising regularly. I still work a full-time teaching job, and i know faculty much younger than I who get worn out just as quickly as I do, if not sooner (some tell me they are amazed at my stamina, even though to me it is not as strong as when I was younger). I personally know of others in their 70s and 80s who are just as active as I am, if not more so. I think it helps that I work with people of all ages, including very young college students (who I miss right now in this time of stay-at-home orders).\nA photo from earlier this year after my hair was redone—and yes, it is a purple tint (many of my students and colleagues say they love it)\nAnd another in my office on campus from last fall, as the professor:\nNot too bad I think for someone who could be the grandmother of some of my students!\nI do find it amusing that some think they know best what an older person can do, wear, or be. Not just younger people, but those my age or older. I do try to avoid such persons. And for me personally, I can’t quite eat all the foods I could when younger, but so what? I’ve been experimenting with foods I avoided when young, so it all evens out. I was planning to take a trip to see a sister in Arizona before COVID-19 hit, and to go to a conference in November in another state (that might still happen). Another of my sisters, just two years younger, had to cancel a trip to Japan this spring for the same reason. She and her spouse, who is in his 70s, have traveled extensively all around the globe in the past decade. I and my spouse took a long 3000 mile road trip in 2018, and were planning a possible trip for my birthday, but that isn’t so likely right now. Well, one must adapt. Cancelled trips can be rescheduled. Others I know my age and older also have traveled both in and out of the country.\nMainly it is important to keep busy, engaged, and active at any age to avoid stagnation. Yeah, sometimes I talk about aches and pains with my oldest friends or family, but the talk swiftly moves to other more interesting topics. In other words, I embrace getting older, and I would never dream of telling others my age (or older) what to avoid.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "Stanislav and Arkhipov\nNo.\nRepeatedly history has shown that self preservation and concern for their families outweighs an order from a crazy person.\nOn October 27, 1962 the captain of a Soviet sub wanted to use nuclear warheads to attack American ships. A Soviet submariner by the name of Vasily Arkhipov refused to authorize the launch of the warhead.\nOn September 26, 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down KAL 007, Stanislav Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the US, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm and refused the protocol which called for a launch. He was correct.\nAll point to the fact there is a human element to any launch and that human element will not take orders blindly, especially if they deem the orders to be unreliable. It has happened in the past.",
      "2": "50/50 (or worse) for a limited strike. However, full strategic bombing of major cities in Ukraine is far less likely.\nRussia is not Soviet Union. Most senior officers in Russian army are products of “counter-selection” meaning that, generally, only those that are mindlessly loyal their superiors are promoted. On top of this, there is wide-spread embezzlement and theft, so many are on the hook for criminal charges if they disobey their superiors. This last factor is what makes modern Russia different from the Soviet Union.\nThe precise question is: what is the likelihood of one or two smart and somewhat uncorrupted officers being present on duty in the command chain needed to launch nuclear weapons. And that’s probably 50/50, or worse, meaning that more likely than not, a limited nuclear strike would be launched if ordered.\nFor those that are still skeptical of this argument, just look at how the war in Ukraine has been fought thus far. Losing 1000-2000 troops a day is not an big issue for Russian leadership. Russia is likely assuming that a limited nuclear attack on Ukraine would not trigger a nuclear response from the West, and whatever losses the even-more-limited non-nuclear response would cause would be largely inconsequential. One could even argue that a limited nuclear strike against Ukraine could strengthen Putin’s position domestically.\nAll of this being said, it is important to note that trying to appease Russia might just increase the chances of nuclear misbehavior — so this is not in any way a suggestion that the West should be deathly afraid of Russian nuclear threats. The threats and the actual attack are only loosely connected. One is a PR exercise and the other is a strategic military matter. So yeah… this is what happens when a nuclear-armed country goes nuts.",
      "3": "Speculating on the actions of specific individuals or military personnel in hypothetical scenarios is challenging, as it depends on numerous factors such as their personal beliefs, loyalty, and the dynamics of the situation. It is important to note that I can provide a general perspective, but cannot predict the exact behavior of individuals.\nIn the case you mentioned, the decision to launch nuclear weapons is typically not made by a single individual but involves a chain of command and a system of checks and balances. The use of nuclear weapons is a grave decision that carries immense consequences, and military personnel are trained to evaluate the legality, morality, and strategic implications of such actions.\nWhile loyalty and obedience to superiors are important in military structures, military officers are also bound by ethical principles and international laws. The decision to launch nuclear weapons would involve careful considerations, including the legitimacy of the order, adherence to international agreements, and the potential catastrophic consequences of such an action.\nIt is worth mentioning that diplomatic efforts, international pressure, and treaties like the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are in place to discourage the use of nuclear weapons and promote global security. These mechanisms aim to prevent situations where leaders might make impulsive or irrational decisions regarding nuclear weapons.\nIt is crucial to prioritize peaceful resolutions and diplomatic negotiations to avoid the escalation of conflicts and the use of nuclear weapons, as they carry devastating consequences for all involved parties.",

      "5": "Stanislav and Arkhipov\nNo.\nThroughout history, we've seen that people care more about protecting themselves and their families than following orders from someone who's acting irrationally.\nLet me share two examples:\n1. In 1962, during a tense time, the captain of a Soviet submarine wanted to use nuclear warheads to attack American ships. But a brave Soviet sailor named Vasily Arkhipov said no and didn't allow the launch.\n2. In 1983, after the Soviet military mistakenly shot down a civilian plane (KAL 007), a man named Stanislav Petrov was in charge of a system that warned of incoming missiles. The system said the U.S. had launched missiles, but Petrov thought it was a mistake and didn't follow the rules to launch a counterattack. Turns out, he was right.\nThese stories show that when it comes to making critical decisions about launching weapons, there's a human factor involved. People won't blindly follow orders, especially if they think those orders are wrong or dangerous. It's happened before, and it's an important reminder that humans can make a difference in crucial moments.",

The vast mass of Russian Senior Generals are not the noisy people on Telegram, they are quiet conscientious and professional people who look at Putin with concern. There is an argument to be made that the Senior, but not overly political Russian Military Men, may actually be Russia’s salvation, maybe a bit of an ask but that genuinely professional cadre will stop a Strangelove kind of stupidity.",
      "10": "I did a 5 minute research on that.\nBig part of the system seems to be automatized. “Management to command posts and individual silos if a nuclear strike is detected by seismic, light, radioactivity, and pressure sensors even with the commanding elements fully destroyed. Upon activation and determination of the happening of a nuclear war\n, the system sends out a 15P011\ncommand missile with a special 15B99\nwarhead that passes commands to open all silos and all command centers of the RVSN\nwith appropriate receivers in flight. The command missile system is similar to the US Emergency Rocket Communications System\n.”\nWe can assume that there is no requirement for a naive person.",

      "2": "When I moved in with my fiance on his farm, there was a barn cat who was extremely friendly. When she had kittens, I went to the barn every day to see them. One day, while puttering in the kitchen, I heard a meow at the door. When I opened the door, she walked right into the kitchen followed by her three kittens. Once the kittens were in, she asked to go back out and didn’t return until evening. I had a ball with those kittens. They each had their own personality, but one had a deformity that left her with a large hump on her back. The mother cat did this two or three times a week for the next few weeks. I was the babysitter. By then, it was summer. All three kittens now old enough to pretty much fend for themselves and spent most of the time in the front yard. They’d grown up to lovely cats. The male was a beautiful blond, no stripes. He looked like Simba, the lion king, so of course, I named him Simba. The little humpbacked female, smaller than her siblings, was named Quasi Moto and the female grey was named Artemis as she was an avid hunter. The mother cat still came around but only now and then. She never treated Quasi any different than the other two. However, Quasi couldn’t hunt for herself. She was slow and unable to run. So, Artemis would hunt and bring back mice for Quasi and then stand guard so Simba couldn’t steal it from her. I’d never seen a cat with so much compassion for a litter mate. I really think, in this case, yes the malformed kitten was treated differently but much like humans, they developed their method of caring for and accommodating the handicapped sibling with consideration and respect.",

She was done with him. She wouldn't help him stand up and she wouldn't let him feed on her milk.\nWell, people thought it's because she's the first time mother, inexperienced, and they interferred: we all did what we could to keep the foal alive.

      "6": "Yes to a degree. It depends on the animal concerned.\nPredators have been observed either killing or more usually abandoning malformed offspring. In some cases, as has been observed in the case of a tiger, the Mother killed her only cub. It is thought that this happened because it was only one cub and by killing the cub the tigress would come back into heat and hopefully give birth to more next time.\nOn another occasion, a Mother was observed killing a male cub as it had a malformed penis and probably considered it a waste of time raising it as it would be incapable of passing her genes on.\nAn orange tiger killed her white cub on one occasion (the other 3 were orange). it was thought that this was to give the others a better chance of survival as a white cub could easily have given away a hiding place.\nAll of the above are rare occurences though not unheard of. It is quite common in many animals if there is a weak member of the litter for that member to be killed or abandoned to give the rest a better chance.

You see, Megan was born with a hernia, which manifested itself as a golf-ball sized lump hanging down from her stomach. She was part of a litter of (I think) five other kittens, and her mother decided that she would rather focus her parenting efforts on the five healthy kittens, and ignored poor Meg. She didn’t get fed. There’s no doubt that, had this been in the wild, Megan would have starved to death.\nThere is, as you’ve probably already worked out, a happy ending. You see, we were getting a kitten anyway - the kitten in question was a few weeks older than Meg, and he was all by himself in a litter of one. His mother obligingly took poor, imperfect, Megan as one of her own and fed her alongside her own kitten.\nWe ended up with both kittens.

She was noticeably small, ate too little and was not active. She did not play as much as her 3 siblings did. Rather she chose to be a spectator while they all played.\nOn 5th May Snowy took Shona and left her on another property. I was home when she did it so I was observing Snowy. Sometimes she moved her babies to another place, after staying with me for a week. I thought she was doing the same. But she did not show any signs of relocating the rest of the kittens. I was growing anxious as I could hear Shona crying. Snowy laid down, relaxing.\nI did not want a bird or any other feral cat make a meal out of that tiny kitten. I went to that house, requested the owner lady to allow me to go up to their terrace. There she was, in the open, available to any animal or bird.

She was not happy to see the kitten.\nSnowy got killed on 7th May by stray dogs. All other kittens got adopted but Shona. She is still with me.

      "10": "My parents had a lovely long-haired gray-and-white cat. She got pregnant (several times, in fact, but that’s an answer for another question). One afternoon, she came downstairs, noticeably less rotund than she had been that morning. This struck us a little odd as she was a devoted and attentive mother and would never leave newborn kittens alone to come down to eat and cuddle.\nWe asked her, repeatedly (yes, I know, we personified her), where her kittens were. Eventually, we found them under the bed in an upstairs bedroom. Four little newborn kittens. Their legs were horribly deformed—as if they had been put on backwards. It was clear our little momma had made the decision to abandon them as they had no real chance at a normal life. Two of them also had deformed rib cages, splayed out from their spines.\nSome may say we were cruel not to try to raise them ourselves as special needs cats, but four special needs cats (assuming they survived) was not something we were in a position to handle. My father put them down, and we buried them in our backyard. He cried and was depressed for days.\nTurns out this is not an unheard of occurrence in cats with Persian blood. They carry a recessive gene that can cause angular deformities in kittens. I wish my parents had taken their cat to the vet and had her spayed; although, she did have quite a few beautiful kittens in her lifetime. We were always able to find homes for her kittens; one of them I kept myself. She lived over 18 years and taught me much about cat behavior and communication.",
      "11": "When I was a teenager we had a female cat who had a litter of kittens. She steadfastly refused to feed one of them by pushing him away from her belly or standing up and leaving the box when the other kittens were fed (or she got enough of being squeezed for milk by them). My mother told that to my uncle, who was then in medical school, and he asked to have a closer look at that kitten. By then it was already starving and near death, so he took it with him.\nA few days later, my uncle called my mom and - among other things - he told her that the kitten died the day after he took it and he brought it to the university lab and obtained his biology lecturer’s consent to dissect it there. Turns out that the kitten was born with a congenital malformation of his digestive tract, and would not have survived even if he had been properly fed.\nPlease note that nothing in the kitten’s appearance or behavior could make anybody guess that there was anything wrong with it. Only his mother did - for some uncanny and unknown instinct - know about the issue and acted the way she did.",
      "12": "Some animals will kill malformed babies, even if -to our eyes- they look perfectly fine. Dogs and other canids, cats and other felines, hamsters and other rodents, and birds will more often than not kill any sick offspring so as not to waste time and resources raising it, taking away from the healthy offspring. This is why these animals also tend to have big litters: if one dies, there’s four others to take its place and carry on with the species.\nSome animals simply abandon the malformed baby or scare it off, such as horses, gazelles, and buffalo. This is because these animals are prey animals, so the mother cannot stay in the birthspot for too long, or predators will smell her and come for a meal. If the foal or calf cannot stand about 10–15 minutes after birth, the mother will move on and the baby will starve or be hunted.\nSome other animals might try to raise the malformed baby, such as domestic cows, elephants, most apes, and other animals which tend to have only one baby after a relatively long gestation period. Even if it doesn’t make it to adulthood, they spent so much time gestating the baby that they absolutely must try to raise it. These animals often die victims of predators (in the case of malformed limbs) or starvation (for animals with cleft palates).",

A malformed animal in nature will die. It can't compete for food (be it accessing a mammal mom's teat or hunting on its own), or escape predators well. If it does survive, it will never find a mate.

      "16": "Chickens are cold blooded killers, and they are born that way. When chicks are born, if their mother isn't there, you keep them in a small area with a heatlamp for warmth.\nIf there are crippled chicks, the mothers usually leave them to die. The most common thing is that one chick has one or both legs broken. If you keep the injured ones with healthy chicks, they will peck it to death.\nIf you keep the broken leg chicks, or ones with sores, the other chicks will mercilessly peck it to death. They can sense weakness and will swiftly eliminate and weak chicks from the herd.\nThe mothers don't care about this, and the injured chicks are pretty much goners. Even if you tried to put all the injured chicks in a box, the less injured ones may kill the more injured ones. They won't actually fight or anything, it's more that they will gang up and slowly peck one or two much weaker chicks to death.\nFor these reasons you usually just snap the little guys necks if they are injured. It's better than a very slow and painful death at the beaks of his siblings. And if the mothers won't care for them, they will die anyways.",

At times, as has been seen on account of a tiger, the Mother killed her main whelp. It is imagined that this happened in light of the fact that it was just a single whelp and by killing the fledgling the tigress would return into heat and ideally bring forth more sometime later.\nOn another event, a Mother was noticed killing a male whelp as it had a twisted penis and likely thought of it as an exercise in futility raising it as it would be unequipped for passing her qualities on.\nAn orange tiger killed her white offspring on one event (the other 3 were orange). it was believed that this was to allow the others a superior opportunity of endurance as a white whelp could undoubtedly have offered a concealing spot.\nThe above are all uncommon occurences however not unfathomable.

      "21": "One year, our ODFW head biologist brought me a very tiny, 3 week old bobcat kitten to rehabilitate. A fisherman on the river watched the mother carry the kitten down to the highway and set it down in the middle of the road, after looking both ways. She left it there, and went up the hill a ways and watched it, clearly waiting for a car to run over it. The fisherman ran to scoop it out of danger and took it to the ODFW office, who told me the story. I knew that bobcats will abandon kittens if they are ill or abnormal, but I was surprised that this mom seemed to be trying to have her baby killed.\nAfter about a week of being in a medium crate, he was out of quarantine and had adapted to his new diet. I put him out in the pen where he would be isolated from humans except when I bottle fed him, and where he would learn to hunt before release. The surveillance camera that night showed him pouncing at a live mouse, and running and playing with a hanging ball; but then he acted a bit wobbly, which isn’t normal. He threw up the next morning, and seemed lethargic. On the way to the veterinarian, he died. She did a necropsy and found that one of the ventricular walls in his heart was almost paper thin. The stress of running and playing when put into the pen was too much for his heart.

She looked to be about 8 months old when we rescued her and wasn’t showing her pregnancy yet, so we had no idea for another few weeks.\n(We guess she’s part Siamese with her blue eyes and particular coloring)\nHaving adopted her on August the 10th, she had a litter of three kittens on September 28th 2018. Because she was adopted we don’t know her exact age, it was listed as one year old at the shelter but she was small and I think around 8 months. Two of her kittens were perfectly normal but the third and smallest one, Sarah, had a clubbed foot. One of her front legs is shorter than the other and the paw is long, narrow, turned inward and only has two toes. I think the correct term for her condition is Syndactyly, meaning the cat's forefeet (rarely the hind feet) have one or more toes fused.\nThis is Sarah, you can se her deformed leg and foot best in the first photo:\nInstead of being a negligent mother, Nona treated her deformed kitten the same as the others and has been a very good mother. Although a little smaller than the other two from the litter and having also suffered from an umbilical hernia (which was found and repaired when she was spayed) Sarah thrived. She walks on three legs with a limp because her leg is too short to touch the ground but she’s otherwise perfectly normal and runs through the house with the rest. Unfortunately though this past year (2020) she’s had at least three grand mal seizures spaced widely apart which is frightening but the vet said there’s nothing to be done because they’re infrequent thus far.\nSarah and her mama playing in the paper from a delivery box on her second birthday:\nThis is Fatso from the same litter, don’t judge, my Fiance named him and he’s a big boy at 15 lbs. he’s just a big kitty. Sarah weighs 10 lbs. herself.",

So having a weak or malformed baby can be detrimental should a large predator (coyote, wolf, etc.) show up. So, that explains wanting to kill the offspring. But why eat it?

      "24": "When I was a little kid we had few ducks and geese. One little duck was the runt and had little underdeveloped wings. As it began to grow it was being outsized by its siblings and obviously had tiny wings, perfectly developed, but way too small to fly. The other ducks would peck at him, especially at feeding time. My Mom let me take the duck, and I named him ‘Denny'. Somehow Denny bonded with my tricycle, because he slept under it, and would follow it everywhere I would take it. He was pretty affectionate toward me, too, and would snuggle up to me, but my bike was his Mommy, I'm pretty sure. I had Denny for a little over a year, and people in the neighborhood were accustomed to seeing the duck running after my tricycle as I rode by, but when we got some new next door neighbors, their Dachshound grabbed onto Denny and killed him. I was heartbroken. They tried to compensate me by getting a new duckling for me, but it just wasn't the same. That was a very personable duck. Too bad that goddamned dog had to kill him. However, karma did come into play not too long after, and the dog was bitten in the neck by a snake and killed.",
      "25": "To be sure somewhat. It depends upon the animal concerned.\nTrackers have been seen either killing or even more commonly leaving disfigured successors. On occasion, as has been seen by virtue of a tiger, the Mother killed her primary whelp. It is envisioned that this occurred considering the way that it was only a solitary whelp and by killing the juvenile the tigress would return into heat and in a perfect world deliver all the more in a little while.\nOn another occasion, a Mother was seen killing a male whelp as it had a curved penis and reasonable idea of it as a waste of time raising it as it would be unequipped for passing her characteristics on.\nAn orange tiger killed her white posterity on one occasion (the other 3 were orange). it was accepted that this was to permit the others a prevalent chance of perseverance as a white whelp could without a doubt have offered a disguising spot.\nThe above are extraordinary occurences anyway not incredible. It is exceptionally viewed as typical in various animals if there is a weak person from the litter for that part to be killed or abandoned to permit the rest a prevalent open door. It is all fundamental for the upsetting round of life and end.\nAbove - a lovely tiger family.",
      "26": "Mostly yes. I had a much loved small dog as a teenager, she had a litter of 8 pups by a friends Pekingese male who jumped the fence and got to her before we could have her spayed. She refused to care for one pup. She was a devoted mom to the rest of the litter but not that pup. She flat ignored it. My dad decided he wanted that pup and that I was gonna raise it by hand. LOL That was a unforgettable and horrible 6 weeks.\nTinker, as she was named, was mentally handicapped. Physically she was fine but mentally .. not so much. Dumbest dog I ever saw and the hardest to care for. She lived to be 15 yrs old and was dad’s loved companion for her entire life, but she barely learned her name and would run into a patio door regularly because she never figured out that because she could see through it didn’t mean she could run through it. (Her eyesight was fine)\nFidget had to have realized somehow that her puppy wasn’t right, she spent all her energy on her 7 healthy pups and wasn’t going to risk their lives taking care of a pup who wasn’t healthy.",
      "27": "Yes they do. It is due to the “survival of the fittest” thing that is deeply embedded in nature. Animals have still the knowledge to determine if their baby is strong enough to hold out on its own and grow up to survive nature as it is. We humans, in all respect, have gone way overboard.\nSo if a baby of an animal is showing it is not “quite” right, the mother will immediately notice this and if she deems the little baby “unfit” to survive, she will stop giving any energy in that baby and spend it to the healthy batch. This is not cruel or mean, it is just as nature is dealing with the occasional “natural defects” that life can pop up at times. I know this may all sound incredibly hard to humans but again, in the wild, it is all about survival of the fittest. But will they treat each malformed baby that way? Not per se. Sometimes a malformation is not really much of a problem and then the mothers just go on as they would with any other baby. Only if it may become a problem for the animal itself to exist or grow up to adulthood and survive, it is time for a mother animal to just leave it. This varies from animal to animal. Also, and you can not see this always in animals, mentally it may have a problem too, and that is something too the mothers pick up on very quickly where humans tend to overlook to see this.\nSince in the wild animals do not have humans around, the baby commonly indeed then dies. With the exception of perhaps a very very few. But domesticated animals have humans around to help out and thus the malformed babies have a higher chance to survival because we as humans step in. The mom, however, still rejects the baby because that is what her instinct tells her. Not because she is wanting to be cruel or because she is mean… She just does not have any other thoughts or behavior ways to change this. That said… by us humans stepping in at such situations is not really making things better at times either. Because we lack to see any longer what the extend of the malformation is… we keep, unknowingly, weaker animals alive to build up a life and have offspring too… And if the malformation was genetical it will be “spread” largely. Since the weak animal has survived with the aid of us humans it is highly possible that their offspring, if born with the same malformation as the parent(s), their children will need aid from humans as well to survive. Thus creating an entire line of animals that all have a problem… They will not thrive if humans are not there to help their offspring to survive. Because, even though nature can be complicated, at times it is also horribly simple.\nLuckily nature is also very adaptable and eventually it will set things straight. And in a way, it does this by rendering some animals born with malfunctions, sterile. So they can not have any offspring and thus the line with that malfunction may not proceed to exist. (That is unless humans pop in once again to go and make it happen with one or two of the many ways we have found to even go past that.)\nNow after having written all of the above, please do not take any offence (since I have been accused a lot of times of literally saying only the strong and beautiful and healthy are to survive… Which is not what I even meant…) it is the description, in a very short version on how things go in nature and how humans intervein with it.",
      "28": "When I was a kid we had a Holstein cow that gave birth to twins. She rejected one and allowed the other to nurse. Dad told me this was not unusual. We hand fed the rejected calf. If there was anything wrong with it I sure could not see it.\nLater on we had a cat who gave birth to a kitten with birth defects. Instead of rejecting it she nursed it longer than the others. My deformed cat lived 17 years and even when she was suffering from Alzheimer’s she was still deadly on mice.",
      "29": "I can't speak for all animals but my experience with this traumatized me for life.\nMy uncle raised hunting beagles. I was there helping during the birthing. It was winter and there was snow on the ground. One of the pups had a deformed leg and the mother kept pushing it out of the doghouse. I'd put it back in and she'd push it back out. This went on for days. I had to hold the mom down to let this baby eat because she would not let it, otherwise. I kept it with me when it wasn't eating, so it wouldn't freeze to death being pushed out.\nAfter about a week, I had to go visit another relative. I took the pup and took care of it. I bottle fed it, cared for it and kept it alive. I slept with it and carried it around in my shirt.\nAfter 3 weeks, she was doing great. No problems at all. She was a pudgy little butterball. I thought it would be fine to take the baby back to mom. I put her in with her siblings during a feeding and went into the house to get the mom some water. When I came back, mom was in the middle of eating that baby.",
      "30": "Dogs do. It took me some time to come to terms with it - but yes, they do ignore or kill the weak offspring. Dogs moms live as per their ancestral instincts, and those instincts are perfectly adjusted to ensure the species survival in an unforgiving world.\nThe mom will protect and care for the strongest puppies. And that's because they have the best chances to live.",

      "32": "I haven’t seen this behavior in cats or dogs. I’ve experienced both caring for and ensuring the health and welfare of babies born without one or more limbs. In fact I’ve watched the mom even give them favor to ensure continued health. I don’t know if the acceptance would be similar if the pup or kitten were born with internal issues that would prevent it from thriving but do believe the mom would know if this were the case. I have a kitten right now that was born with a front leg deformity.\nThe momma (stray at the time but not now) brought her and her other siblings to me around the age of 4 weeks. The others followed her as she carried the one though it could have kept up. I could not tell she was different until I picked her up because she was so furry.\nNow she is far more faster than her brothers and has learned to do most everything they do. She’s extremely spoiled so she picks on everyone and we all let her…….and adore her playful spirit. She has no idea she is different. Such a sweetie!!!!",
      "33": "Some years ago, I bred a litter of Afghan Hound puppies. The mother, Elle, totally rejected the second puppy, Mindy, who was too weak to nurse. I would put Mindy on a nipple and Elle would push her so far away, she could not even share the warmth of her litter mates and mother.\nWith the help of my vet, Mindy survived the first day and night. By the second day, she was strong enough to nurse. At that point, Elle welcomed her back and began to clean her up enthusiastically. Mindy survived but developed “swimmers” in which she was unable to use her rear legs to stand up. After physical therapy (I put a piece of carpet in a shoebox so she could push up using the sides and a rough surface), she developed into a healthy, beautiful and extremely intelligent Afghan that I kept for her entire life. (If anyone doubts Afghan's intelligence, she was very fond of thinking up and playing practical jokes.) Incidentally, I later bred Mindy and she rejected her entire litter. I had to hand raise them from birth.",
      "34": "Some mothers, through no lack of love, will reject or abandon their offspring shortly after birth. ...

We cuddled it till it died..",
      "36": "Yes. Usually they will eat them. If the offspring is incapable of taking of itself and surviving on its own, they will kill it, or abandon it. It is not going to live long in the wild anyway, a predator will get it sooner or later. So they will not expend any precious energy or effort on them.",
      "37": "We used to live on the edge of a village with ponds around us with several duck families every spring. I made a point of keeping an eye on the ducklings, feeding them special duckling crumbs from time to time, and warding off crows and other vermin who threatened to take them. Part of this procedure would involve doing a daily headcount . One spring we had a family of 3 ducklings and a family of 5. They had probably begun as families of 12, but even the best of mums can loose the lot. By the time we went away for a holiday the two families were well grown and pretty safe.\nWhen we returned I was thrilled to count the family of 5 who had returned to the chicken run for feeding, all as large as the Mum, so I couldn’t tell which was which. In the background I could hear the most awful squeals of a very baby duckling, too young to be a part of this family. I followed the sound only to find a large duck making the noise, and it was coming from inside dense and spiky bushes. When it emerged it was sort of heading towards the chickens, but it kept stopping, and then zig-zagging across the grass. Something was wrong, and at a distance I could not tell what. Then the horror hit me-it was blind. This was one of the five, as my count had mistakenly included the mum.\nIn its terror of blindness, the injured duck only wanted to be with its family. At that age the large youngsters were full of energy and were charging about, with mum trying to keep up with them. And then followed, slowly, desperate, crying, lost, trapped, and terrified, was this last duckling. The crows had ripped out her eyes.\nI spent the next 5 weeks listening out for them, listening for the terrified screams searching for her family in her darkness, and going out with food to feed them all and trying to get to the blind duck to feed it from my hand. Sometimes she would take a little, and only a fraction of what the others had while I was trying to keep them occupied and slow them down so the last one could catch up with them. Sometimes I would hear them at 5 in the morning, and would tear downstairs in my nightclothes, climb down muddy banks and reach through prickly bushes to try to reach the blind duckling to feed her.\nIt didn’t take long for the entire duck community of the village, and neighbouring villages to cotton on to the prolific food supply. At times I was having to occupy 30 or more ducks with food to keep them away from the blind duck, just so that I could feed her.\nThe significant realisation for me, was that the family still stuck together. Even though the youngsters were charging about, tailed by their protective mum, they would pause and wait for their blind sister to catch up. They hadn’t abandoned her in their crazy charging about lifestyle, nor driven her away because of her ailment.\nOn one occasion I watched them leaving one area, heading back to the water, and blind duck was having a particularly hard time finding her way though and around trees, not sure quite where they were, which way they had gone, or what was in front of her when she bumped into it. They all stopped on the bank about 30 feet away and one brother duck came back for her and walked with her until she was able to find them and join them.\nSo there is the answer. These wild ducks were looking after their blind sibling, even when grown enough to have gone their own way.\nThere is more to this story about the blind duck. I sometimes think that it should really be turned into a short story for children.\nTo compare this story with how the chickens identify, separate out, and alienate a chick hours old who has a mis-shapen oviduct -which is invisible- is quite a contrast in behaviour. This is why this caring support in a wild species is so admirable to me.",
      "38": "Yes in the wild they usually kill them or refuse to feed them. A deformed animal won't be able to take care of itself so there is no point in the parent wasting food or energy taking care of it.\nWhen I was young my grandma had a semi feral cat who had kittens twice a year (neutering was not a thing back then), as she got older she had more and more deformed kittens and she killed or refused to acknowledge every single one of them. This meant she could concentrate on the healthy kittens.\nHumans are the only animals that do this and e ven then its a more recent thing…not too many years ago disabled babies were left to die because there was no way to provide good care. Even if they did survive they would rarely thrive, the more wealthy would be more likely to at least try but the poor people wouldn't bother because they could not provide 24 hour care. The father pretty much did nothing with the kids anyway and the mother had several other children to care for, limited food and space and knew if the child made it to adulthood they would not be able to work or even raise livestock so would end up begging for scraps and die young anyway.",
      "39": "Yes. Animals are driven by instincts, one of which is the general instinct to survive. If a baby is born malformed or ill in some way the mother will most likely know it and will ignore that baby. The mother has some kind of instinctual understanding that the baby won’t survive and so she doesn’t waste resources or effort on it. In the wild food and resources are scarce, it makes more survival sense to use resources for babies who have a better chance of living. It sounds harsh to human beings but life in the wild is unforgiving. A whole litter could suffer or die if they were held back by a malformed or ill littermate.",

      "41": "It’s kidding season here on our small farm and one of our does (female goats) just kidded, giving birth to three babies. Unfortunately one of them, an undersized male, has a hare lip. That’s a very bad deformity in any animal but especially in a goat. Goats use their camelid lips almost like we use our hands; they’re practically prehensile. I’m not sure if this little goat can even form a seal around a teat in order to nurse. Anyway, sure enough the mother recognizes that there’s something wrong with this baby and will not let it even try to nurse. It cried all night but now the cries are getting fainter. We are doing the right thing: nothing. Just letting nature take its course. This is agony for us but it’s one of the realities on any animal farm. An alternative is to put the kid down humanely, but we don’t have access to a large-animal vet at night and it’s very expensive.",
      "42": "In many cases, the mother knows intuitively when something is seriously wrong with a newborn and she’ll reject it or let it die. This can be heartbreaking, but it’s nature’s way of ensuring survival of the fittest.\nA real conundrum: when we save these humans(we are human, different in some ways than other mammals), we are giving them the chance to reproduce more of the same(if this happens), thereby lowering the overall quality of our species. Seriously, this is a huge ethical/moral issue.",

      "47": "I have seen two examples of mother cats placing a kitten outside the nest.\nOne was almost dead already and had some thing so seriously wrong that the vet could save it.\nThe other was a severe epileptic and constantly fitted until it died\nThese tragedies have stayed with me and still bring a lump to my throat.\nI dont blame the mother cat but it points up the fact that nature is cruel.\nJR",
      "48": "It depends. If the deformity is slight and doesn’t drastically effect their ability to fend for themselves, then probably not. But oftentimes, if the deformity is debilitating, then they will abandon them. A neighbor’s Arabian mare gave birth and the mare refused to nurse it, moving away whenever the foal attempted it. By holding the mare still we basically forced her to nurse her baby every two hours. The next day, we took both mare and foal to the vet. After many tests, the unfortunate foal died. An autopsy revealed that the baby had a twisted gut and even surgery wouldn’t have helped. The mother sensed that her baby had a fatal condition and abandoned her. That’s nature.",
      "49": "Yes. They will often abandon them.",
      "50": "Years ago we had a family member who was born with a devastating facial disfigurement (Thankfully Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles has rectified a lot of this, but it’s still a lifetime of medical treatment.) We all love the child, now a teenager, and don’t really notice, but when he was an infant it was difficult to take the child out.\nMy son, at the time, was a college student, and reading a lot of books, etc, claiming that there was essentially no difference between humans and animals.\nI disagreed with one question: “How do you think an animal would have dealt with *****’s challenges?”\nMy son never brought up the subject again.\nMy daughter was also in college at the time, and she was enjoying a school year abroad in Europe. I flew to Germany to visit her, and we were on a flight to Greece for a weekend holiday. On the flight she opened her laptop, and a picture of the infant was her screensaver, in the child’s full glory, displaying in the infant’s complete disfigurement.\nOur seatmate was shocked, and my daughter politely explained the situation.

It’ll enter their body, cause cavitation, at, at the very least, leave them bleeding out on the ground.\nNo, if you want to even hope to stop a rifle round, you need a trauma plate.\nAnd because these are just slabs of ceramic, you need a plate carrier to actually strap this to your chest.\nOf course, these are only bullet resistant. Its designed to fracture, and ultimately shatter, with repeated hits. So, if the first round doesn’t penetrate, I’ll simply shoot you again and again and again.\nAnd each impact, even if it does not penetrate, will still cause damage. You may not end up with your organs being eviscerated or bodily fluids ejected, but you will be pounded with each hit.\nAnd all of this assumes you’re not hit in the head or legs. A headshot will knock you out of the fight, if not kill you outright.

They won't put a hole in your chest, but you'll definitely feel the impact, and its much more of an impact than being punched.\nAll that said, since most people who carry have a pistol, I'd choose a pistol chambered in something normal like 9mm, 10mm or 40 S&W. Then select my ammo based on the highest momentum, which is dependent on grain weight and muzzle velocity.

      "25": "I’ll ask you, do you think this would hurt?\nKevlar, or body armor, has different levels of protection.\nEven with our “beloved” democrats trying to ban body armor for civilians (unless they pass a federal background check and have a reason to need it), most people don’t wear it. If they do, it’s likely level IIIA or less. Concealable. A few mass shooters wear heavier levels, like IV, but they’re heavy, cumbersome, and expensive. Heavier levels like this can absorb impacts of smaller rounds better, but they’re not perfect.\nMy pick is a .45acp. The older 230gr rounds especially. This requires the level IIIA armor to stop. I have carried the 9mm. If a revolver, then a .41 Magnum, a .44 Magnum, or the rare .45 Colt. These will leave a nasty bruise.\nAgainst four guys, this means two shots each, with an eight shot Government Model 1911. A tight group will weaken Kevlar. It might be enough to punch through if the first one doesn’t by itself.\nWe had a drill, called the Mozambique Drill, which consisted of two to the chest and one to the head. This was designed in case your attacker had body armor on. Rarely do they protect the head. They’ll need to be in military/police gear to handle this.\nIf it’s clear they’re wearing protection, I’m going to aim for the head anyway. Lethal force is justified. I’m outnumbered and they are armed. If I’m “in fear” for my life, I’m green. And, as trained, I’m not shooting to wound. I intend to stop the assault against me.\nIf I know I’m going into harms way, I’m not going to rely on a handgun. My go-to, when working years ago, was a 5.56mm short rifle, called an SMG at the time. The nasty little rounds I carried would take out a lot of modern armor today because the velocity was very different then. At 50 feet, that round will do nasty things to body armor and people. The 20 round magazine, small by today’s standards, works well with trigger control.",
      "26": "An A-10. Even without flying, I can just sit in the cockpit until they exhaust themselves.",
      "27": "Ryan Payne’s answer to this question is spot on, but I have an add…\nSee, a rifle’s great, if I have one to hand. But most people don’t most of the time. Much more commonly available and readily carried is the pistol.\nThere’s a pistol shooting drill advocated by many, originally described (or advocated-for) by Col. Jeff Cooper, known as the “Mozambique” after one of his students used it in self-defense in that place. It amounts to aiming your first two shots for upper-center-mass of your target, and allowing the recoil from the second shot to raise your sights upward to place a third round in the brain-box.\nAn advantage thus to this technique is that even if a target is wearing armor - or your first shots fail to hit a vital organ by some chance - the third shot should do for the bad guy pretty reliably, especially if your marksmanship is judicious.\nNow, however, body armor is more common and easier to acquire than when Col. Cooper was in his teaching days, so, a more modern technique - I don’t know if it has a name, properly - I have been introduced to is to instead aim lower…\nBecause exactly nobody is wearing armor over their hips.\nOne of course must be considerate of the number of rounds in their magazine and how many targets they expect to engage, but if you were drilling Mozambique (or “Failure to stop”) with a 1911 before, you were still putting 3 of your 7+1 in a single target. Now just put them in their pelvis, or thereabouts. If you’ve got a double-stack 9mm with 15+ rounds in the well, put 5 rounds in for good measure.\nNo, there are no vital organs there. But if your target is wearing body armor and you don’t have a caliber to penetrate it, you’re not hitting those regardless of how good a shot you are, and getting a headshot with a pistol against a moving target who doesn’t want to be shot can be much more easily said than done. Plus, this may be legally/ethically questionable, or fodder for a prosecutor to paint you as having executed your assailant (especially if you live in the wrong state or country). However, the hips are an easy target. They’re big, the whole body follows them so they’re easier to predict/lead, and the femoral artery runs through there. You hit that, they will bleed out in literally seconds.\nChances that you’ll hit that artery are low, true. But! Everything else there is bones and nerves, the bottom of the spinal column, the support system for the legs: what this WILL get you is an immobilized combatant who will almost certainly be in no condition to offend you further when you’ve likely now broken their hips or worse.\nSo! As usual, in self-defense, be it with a sword, knife, or gun, knowing where to hit your opponent, how to hit them, and possessing the skill to do it are areas of primary importance (among others, like how not to get hit yourself, or avoiding the fight altogether) that will help win you the day. Being able to reliably hit a moving target at self-defense ranges while you yourself are high on adrenaline and trying not to get hit yourself is perhaps practical for people who get lots of practice and are skilled marksmen, but most people aren’t professional shooters.\nMe? I’m good enough, and I mean that without hubris. I’m no badass, I’m no operator, or even ex-police or ex-military, and I will probably never get to shoot as many rounds as I’d like as often as I’d like to be the marksman I might like to be. But, I know enough to know what I can and can’t do, what shots I shouldn’t take. I’ve had enough training and experience to be more than merely competent, I think, and for me, it’s a lot easier to aim low at those hips, than it is to pull off a Mozambique at anything more than 2m when there might be innocents I don’t want to hit in the area, which is the vast majority of scenarios where I might need to use force.\nSo, I’m aiming low: they shouldn’t have been doing what they were doing that made me pull the trigger in the first place. The bad guys should just hope it’s merely hollow-point pistol-caliber rounds, and not a 12-gauge I’ve got to hand.\nHowever, to answer your original question? Any semi-automatic magazine-fed rifle firing either 5.56mm AP (steel or tungsten core), or a larger caliber would be most ideal. 20 - 30+ rounds in the magazine should be more than sufficient for your 4 hoodlums and M855 steel-core or M995 tungsten-core rounds will penetrate pretty much anything without a plate.\n(M855 and M995 armor-piercing round cross-sections. The hardened core - as opposed to soft lead - ignores kevlar in thicknesses it is practical for people to wear. Image credit: 80percentarms.com\n)\nAs I said though, it’s hard to have a rifle to hand all the time. If I thought this were a likely scenario and money was not an object, I might instead opt for an FN Five-seveN:\n(FN Herstal’s “Five-seveN” pistol chambered in the 5.7x28mm SS90 round. Image Credit: Military Times\n)\nThe SS90 round is basically a small rifle round fired from a pistol, and it goes ludicrously fast. Like, 1,600′ (487m) per second. It’s the little round that could, and what it can do is say, “What body armor doing?”\nFollowing that, really judicious marksmanship with any firearm would turn the trick, but, again, if I get to pick, and I can’t have a firearm, I’m going with the king of the pre-gunpowder battlefield:\n(Medieval boar spear. Image credit: By-the-sword.com\n)\nThe spear. Specifically, a boar spear. The Romans learned the hard way with the Picts the danger of the enemy getting overly impaled on ones’ weapon. In particular, as the story goes, the Picts would paint themselves in wode (making them blue in color) which is a mild hallucinogen, so they would run screaming and “tripping balls” (to use a colloquialism) into combat with the Romans, whereupon coming on the Roman turtle, would be impaled on their spears, and then continue to charge the Roman soldier holding it, hacking the fellow to death over the edge of his shield. It is past this point where we see the Roman legion adopt the boar spear over the traditional leaf-bladed spear, as the crossbar at the bottom prevents this from happening, and enables one to either hold their enemy at a distance, or withdraw the weapon (and thus regaining control over it) without it getting caught up in things like bone or sinew, leather armor… or in the instant case, kevlar.\nI’ve had enough staff and spear training to be quite confident in my ability to hold my own against 4 knife-armed attackers wearing nothing more than kevlar. Hell, even if it’s just a staff or short-stick, I’ll still “give them a sound thrashing, old chap!”, but I’d still put my order of priority just as I’ve presented it here.\nTL;DR - Something pointy. Ideally something pointy and fast, or at least something that gives me reach and lets me maintain my distance.\nOriginal question: Four people armed with knives approach you.

You basically can’t stand up without doubling over for 5 minutes, and you can’t run for another 10 minutes. One hit is all it takes, leaving me plenty of time to run away.\nGroin protection? No problem! With sufficient strength, a hit to any unprotected area on the body with the flat of the blade can cause a LOT of pain. A few hits are all it would take to lay them on the ground. The arms, legs, shoulders and hands are all excellent targets. If they’re not wearing helmets, the top of the head works as well.\nIf they happen to be covered head to toe in some kind of body armour that protects them from blunt force, you can snap the tip off of the fencing sword, creating a jagged end. It might not be as sharp as an actual rapier, but with enough force, I could almost certainly pierce through kevlar. I know this from personal experience, as I once scraped my knee on the tip of a broken sword, about two years ago. I still have the scar on my knee.\nIn conclusion, unless they decide to throw the knife, there is almost no way they could hit me. A rapier could take 4 armed people, regardless of body armour.",
      "34": "That's easy. Any one of my handguns. I live in NY. When I go target shooting at silhouette targets, instead of aiming for the point scale center mast, I only practice head shots. The laws here are so screwed up, generally in favor of the criminal, so the theory is that dead motherfu**ers can't sue…. Next question??",

      "37": "Are their heads armored? Or their knees?\nIf not—or hell, even if they are, because there ain’t no knee- or head-armor that I know that can stop a .44 Magnum round—my weapon of choice is a Smith & Wesson 629.\nNow, I’m not the best shot, especially with a monster like this. But I’m quite confident that I could hit my target at least four times out of six. I’m also fairly confident that I’d need to hit my target only once. As soon as these jerks see one of their friends’ heads turn into chunky salsa, I have a feeling they won’t be too keen on pursuing their full-frontal knife assault.\nHell, I probably wouldn’t even need to hit ’em in the head. Assuming a Kevlar vest can actually stop a .44 Remington Magnum round at close range—which I wouldn’t bet the farm on—the poor punk I hit would still feel like he’d been punched in the chest by the Incredible Hulk. Four shots to the solar plexus would have these guys doubled up on the ground, nursing bruises the size of dinner platters.",
      "38": "Choice of weapon? That's easy an M9 flamethrower. You spray burning napalm on the perps and I absolutely guarantee they will no longer have any desire to inflict harm to you!",
      "39": "Since you didn’t indicate that the only weapons we could choose from are civilian models, I would choose 2 flash/bang grenades to stun and disorient them, then walk up to them and finish them off with my M1918 BAR and it’s 40 round magazine, chambered in .30–06. Sort of a mix between the new and the old.\nBut if I could only have 1 civilian legal weapon, I would have my Wilson Combat Recon Tactical chambered in .458 SOCOM with my EOTECH HHS Green optic. This combines a green dot holographic sight with a fixed 3X magnifier that can be easily moved to the side for close range shooting. As to why the .458 SOCOM, well the picture pretty much sums it up. The muzzle energy is nearly three times that of the 5.56 NATO round. The setup is pricy, but then again how much is your life worth to you? It’s a specialized cartridge for special situations, and while you could choose any number of cartridges for this situation, this scenario is right up its alley.",
      "40": "I will stick with what I can use effectively.\nI carry on my person at all legally permissible times a Smith & Wesson Model 686, a .357 Magnum. Even if their vest stops the round, the kinetic energy transfer will leave them winded and hurting. Source: I've been shot while wearing armor. The round was stopped. Hurt like a <fill the blank yourself>.\nI also carry a hatchet, an E-Tool (think collapsible shovel), an assortment of knives, and soon enough an electric baton. Yes they exist, $100 or so via Amazon.\nIf I know they're coming, i will use an M1A Scout rifle. Kevlar alone is not enough to stop that rifles rounds at the sort of ranges we are concerning ourselves with in this scenario. It is also a solid piece of metal and wood, and can be adequately used to break jaws.\nRunning a storage building is a surprisingly dangerous job.",
      "41": "I like my short barrel 12 gauge pump shotgun for the knee shots that will put them on the ground. A pistol could be handy for the head shots to finish the job.\nFour people should know better than to bring knives to a gun fight. We can only hope that they haven’t lived long enough to breed offspring. LOL\nI don’t look forward to cleaning up the mess and paying my lawyer tho. He is likely to need extra money to grease the wheels of justice so that I don’t go to jail.\nPerhaps, I should use the shotgun on the heads too. Bigger mess to clean up, but it might confuse the evidence of premeditation? Can they charge you with murder of a body they can’t identify because they can’t find the teeth?",
      "42": "Now the macho answer is to shoot them in the head.\nMy answer:\nGun. Aim for the dick. Still a bigger area than the head (when including the surrounding area). Guaranteed drop shot. Probably change a few of the attackers' minds as well.",

      "44": "Depending on speed of approach and the distance between us I would go with either this\nThe M67 fragmentation grenade. Has a five to ten foot kill radius and a 10 yard injury radius. If they're farther than 20 yards, I pull the pin, toss, and run the opposite direction.\nIf they're closer, I would choose the M37 Ithica Combat Shotgun\nLoaded with\nSabot rounds and 000 buckshot alternating.

It’s similar to a normal revolver, except that it has a rotating belt and can shoot over 30 bullets in a row.\nPros? Easy to hide (could holster it), packs a powerful punch with .45 cal slugs, holds more ammo than most handguns and is more easy to push around than a rifle or machinegun.\nCons? Hard to handle, probably doesn’t have the best accuracy, and weights a ton in a tiny package.\nIf all else fails, though, I’ll pull out my backup weapon:\nAround the corner, metal screeching on hot asphalt! IT’S THE SUPERTANK!!!\nWith tons of firepower, including several machine guns, a heavy artillery piece and a full crew of 4–5 people, we should be able to take them out without any issues.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAnd if they get around that somehow…well, I’ll use my super-last-resort-backup-weapon:\nYes, I’ll be dead too.

      "46": "Lol! This is a crazy backwards question!\nSimple - DON'T be that one person. Join the group of 4 with arms and protection. This is what I did for a day or two in the USMC. It is INCREDIBLY easier (and sometimes fun) when your intended target is outnumbered, outgunned, outtrained, etc…\nI'd just the 4, but bring my guns, that way the crazy person with an M1A doesn't have as good of a chance at survival. That's what we're talking about right? An outmanned unfair situation where the best chance that person has for survival is a gun with bullets.\nYou are a dumbass. Become the criminal. It is a LOT easier to victimize people if they can't defend themselves. I'm sure rapists, child traffickers, murderers, home invaders would LOVE that they know you can't hurt them.",

      "49": "Assuming these four men are attacking you, not simply taking a stroll down the street with sheath knives on their belt:\nJust about any centerfire rifle would do, except for an AR-15, because the standard round fired by the AR-15 is the weak and wimpy caliber .223 Remington (5.66 mm NATO). That’s right; despite all the hysteria from the anti-gun media and anti-gun lobbyists, the AR-15 fires just about the weakest centerfire rifle ammunition still in existence. A .223 bullet might penetrate a Kevlar vest, but then again it might not, depending on whether the Kevlar vest has “rifle inserts” in it to stop centerfire rifle rounds.\nSo I’d pick a rifle that’s chambered in a hunting caliber, one suitable for hunting deer or larger game. Something like .308 Winchster, 6.5 Creedmoor, .30–06, or at the minimum 30–30 Winchester (a caliber that has been around since 1895, and is still far more powerful than the wimpy .223 Remington (5.66 mm NATO) ammunition used in the AR-15, M-16, M-4, etc.\nHowever, it’s possible to buy an upper receiver (“upper”) for an AR-15 to convert it to firing a less wimpy caliber than the .223, such as 300 Blackout, 6.8 Remington SPC, 6.5 Grendel, .450 Bushmaster, etc., and those calibers would probably be adequate, although some of these (including .300 Blackout and 6.5 Grendel) are even less powerful than the 30–30 Winchester (again, a caliber that has been around since 1895)!\nAn AR-10 would be best, chambered in either its standard .308 Winchester (7.62 mm NATO) or in 6.5 Creedmoor. The AR-10 would giv...",
      "50": "4 people armed with knives approach you. Well protected and all of them wear Kevlar vests. What is your choice of weapon?\nAn AR pistol, carbine, or SBR build. The standard-capacity 30-round magazines give me enough ammo to have a reasonable chance to take down 4 attackers before reloading. I can shoot them well before they are close enough to stab me. The .223/5.56 will go right through soft kevlar. Even if they had SAPI plates, that only protects a small portion of their bodies and then they’d be weighed down if I need to run."

This can include incorporating more whole grains, lean proteins, and fresh produce into their menu.\n3. Regional or Cultural Specialties: McDonald's could introduce region-specific or culturally inspired menu items that resonate with local tastes. This approach would allow them to cater to diverse customer preferences and create a unique dining experience in each location.\n4. Limited-Time Collaborations: Partnering with popular brands or celebrities for limited-time collaborations can generate excitement and encourage sales. This strategy has been successfully used by fast-food chains in the past, where they create special menu items inspired by well-known products or personalities.\n5.

It was November, and I knew he hated the cold. Also, if he was on time, he'd get special hot chocolate, with cream, fudge chips, flake and sprinkles, as well as pizza from the take-out and a movie, whichever one he wanted (risky, I know, but hey, I needed to make it worth his while!)\n7:30 p.m. comes and goes, I lock the door. 8:15 p.m., sheepish knock at the door. There stands my lad, cold and without his jacket.\nOkay, what bullshit excuse to explain the lateness and missing coat? He saved a man's life! He tells me he was making his way home, on time, and he saw a guy, mid 20s maybe? wandering around a few blocks from home. Only the guy was naked except for his boxers, and had no shoes on. Son knew this wasn't right, so he started chatting to him to find out what was wrong. Guy told my lad he wanted to die as the voices were driving him crazy. Son was aware of mental illness as number one has schizophrenia and told the guy so.\nHe then managed to get a mobile from someone passing, and call the police to voice his concern. Remember, he's 11. He told me he chatted, kept him off the road, safely, until the cops arrive. Guy then panics, so my lad tells him it's okay, he will be fine, my lad wouldn't lie to him, etc., till he gets into the police van and gets taken to hospital. He then gives a statement to the police, before coming home.\nI call his bluff, and tell him I'm calling our local control room to check. Okay, he says, can he have a cup of tea to warm up while I do so. Yeah, okay, I said.\nI call and ask to speak to someone regarding my pre-teenaged son's assertions. I explain about the lateness, the threat to lock him out, the cocoa and pizza and about the movie. I also said I was aware he couldn't give me details, as he was too young to have them all, but that was his story; should he be grounded longer for lying to his mum or was it actually, against all odds, true?\nWell, the cop on the phone burst out laughing, before calming himself. Apparently, he HAD saved this guy's life, just as he'd said, and told the cops to cover him if he got in trouble, and that I needed to spoil this kid for a week. He was so in control of the situation that the police were impressed a kid of his age could hold his own!\nI cried, I apologized to the cops, I apologise to my lad, and yes, he got whatever he wanted to eat, drink and watch for a whole week!

I just wanna clarify some points.\n1- Number 6 was heading down that slippery slope to youth offending, and felt that he was the boss as he was over six foot tall by 11, so I had to be firm. It doesn't mean I didn't love the bones of the boy!\n2- He knew I was serious, I'd had him wait outside for me before, and he hated it!! That's why I knew it was a great consequence. He knew I was serious. He probably also knew I would let him in once he was well and truly cold. That, folks, is called a consequence of HIS actions. He needed to own it.\n3- He is a lovely lad, but has had things rough. I think his friend being murdered in front of him, resulting in PTSD has helped him see that I wasn't trying to stifle his spirit, but keep him safe instead.\n4- He hasn't seen this, but will do next week when I see him!! Lol. He would love that some of you are telling me I'm cruel and also that some of you are proud of what he's done. He KNOWS I'm proud of him.

I screamed like a kindergartner.\nMy daughter comes trotting back and asks if the snake is still sleeping. No. No he was not.\nIt took me two hours to find it and get it outside. My daughter got an apology and an ice cream cone for her troubles.\nI never doubted her after that!",
      "4": "“Daddy! There’s something under my bed!”\nThe backstory: my wife was sick, and went to bed early. My younger son was congested, and probably starting to get his mother’s virus. I made dinner for the family, helped the boys with homework and reading and baths and reminders that brushing your teeth involved more than looking at a toothbrush for five seconds and that actual toothpaste was required. Finally I got everyone to bed, cleaned up dinner, and settled down with a book in my favorite chair.\nThen I heard the call that I knew had to be false. I responded without getting up:\n“There’s no monster under your bed, just go back to sleep.”\n“No, you can’t hear a monster breathing, that’s just the heating system.”\n“Just settle down, you’ll be OK, remember your meditation exercises to get to sleep.”\n“If I have to come up there, you’ll be in trouble.”\nRealizing that parenting while sitting in a comfy chair and yelling up the stairs was putting me in the company of some bad paternal stereotypes, I finally walked up to my son’s bedroom. I tried to get into his world, and pretended to believe that there could possibly be something under his bed, instead of rejecting his feelings as invalid. I turned on the flashlight on my phone, and prepared to show my older son that there was nothing under his bed. I bent down as he leaned over his bed, I pointed the light underneath, and saw…\n…my youngest son, curled up on the floor below his brother’s bed, sleeping while clutching a pillow, a blanket and a stuffed animal. He was snoring slightly because of congestion from his cold. When we woke him up, he said “There were bad dreams in my room and Mommy is sick so I didn’t want to bother her so I had to come in here.”\nTo this date, my older son is still the only person I know to actually find something under his bed.",
      "5": "When he was six, my son came in all excited from the garden and popped a stone he’d found into my hand. He told me he’d found a Stone Age tool. I chalked it up to a vivid imagination, but to appease him, told him we could ask the head of the local historical society for his opinion.\nWe did that a few months later, and the man’s eyes popped out of his head. He was also a delegate for the state archaeology office and said he needed to send the stone to the museum in Stuttgart for a professional opinion. He was pretty sure it WAS a primitive tool.\nAs it turned out, the stone was a boring tool used to make holes in leather for sewing pieces of leather together. It dated back to the late Stone Age. How my six-year-old recognized that I had no idea.",
      "6": "It was a teacher who thought my child, then seven, had told a whopper. She was so concerned that she called me in for a conference, flanked by an assistant principal and guidance counselor. Apparently, he came in after winter break and told his teacher he had been on a slave ship, but jumped off, and swam to safety on an island. “I worry about this lie!” said the teacher. “Let’s set up some therapy sessions,” suggested the guidance counselor. “Does he need detention?” asked the assistant principal. Hold on! I explained that we had gone to the Dominican Republic on vacation. An excursion offered by the resort was an afternoon sail on the (replica) boat used as the slave ship in the TV miniseries “Roots.” At the halfway point, those who were able jumped off the boat and swam to an island for a (prepared) cookout/picnic. (Others, like me, were paddled to shore in a little rowboat.) My son and his three older siblings swam competitively at that time and easily swam to shore. The history lesson taught on the ship affected him deeply—maybe more than we realized at the time. Once I made it clear that he had not lied, I was given a half-assed apology, upon which I suggested that it was never too early to educate children about slavery in an age-appropriate fashion and promising that I’d clarify to my son the educational nature of the excursion he’d taken. (He had seriously believed that the replica ship we’d been on had carried real slaves, so in a way, I was grateful that I’d been called in to a conference! After that, he became an even more challenging student in terms of the questions he asked, but I was never again called in to verify a “whopper!”)",
      "7": "We live in SW Florida and I was dating a girl who had a 3 year old daughter. We regularly went to the beach where we found shark teeth, usually well under a half inch long. One day the daughter was with me and I had a bit of car trouble so I pulled over next to an empty field. She said that it looked like a good place to look for shark teeth. I figured it would keep her busy for a while. As I was finishing, she came to me and said she found a shark tooth but couldn’t get it. Thinking she found a rock, I told he really we could go look. There it was, a Megladon Tooth about 4″ long!",
      "8": "My daughter, who was 13 at the time, said a kid she knew at school was giving out $100 bills to everyone. Of course I thought there’s no way. We don’t live in a rich neighborhood, nor did she really go to what you call “a rich school” (it’s a public school, not private or charter or anything). I kind of just nodded and said wow.\nShe then brought it up again a few days later and said that she had gotten one. I was like “you have a $100 bill right now???”. She said yes and I told her to go get it to show me. Sure enough, she came out of her room with a folded $100 bill. I kept looking it over to make sure it was legit and then of course was overwhelmed with what I was supposed to do with it. I asked about who this kid was and why he was doing it and she said his parents were rich and gave it to him. Several kids got one and groups were going shopping and to the arcade, etc. Again, though, we don’t live in a rich neighborhood so it didn’t make sense that someone would have this much money to just “give away”.\nI made her give me the money so that (a) I could deposit it to find out if it was real and (b) try to process and decide if we really just keep this money. I asked people at work what I should do because at the time, my daughter was also being bullied for being a tattle-tale. I didn’t want this to come back on her. Luckily, it was that day that I got a call from the principal who asked if my daughter was in receipt of any money. Turns out the kid had stolen over $8k cash from his parents and was just giving it away. (Sadly, he was also being picked on at school and did it to try and get kids to like him.) The parents had pressed charges and were trying to get back as much of the money as they could. I then returned the $100.\nI took the opportunity, though, to tell my daughter how proud of her I was. First, that she told me, and second, that she gave the money back and never blew it. I told her I realized how hard that was because, of course, $100 is a lot of money to a child. I still have the question of why this boy’s family was in possession of so much cash in the first place that he could easily steal, but that’s a whole other story.",
      "9": "Not my kid but our good friend Martina’s son Danny told his school on show and tell day in Canada in the 1970s.\nHe told the tale about how he was in Africa with lions and elephants outside his door. He and his friends would go out to climb trees, first shake the tree so the snakes fall out, then stomp the snakes before climbing the trees. He told a very upsetting make believe story. His teacher was upset as his imagination was running wild. Sent to the principal where he told even more wild stories about him and another friend taking a motorbike to the coast to go swimming for the day. Danny insisted he was telling the truth. The school set up a parent teacher conference to deal with this wild imagination of a second grader in land locked Calgary Alberta. He told even more outlandish stories at recess and lunch. He even made up fake languages to go with his stories.\nMartina was rather upset having to take the day off from her new job to deal with unknown problems her son had caused at school.\nSo Martina goes to school with her son for the conference. Yes they had spent the summer in Greece and Tanzania. He had worried her to death when he disappeared in Greece for the day. He and the neighbors son had taken his motorbike to the coast to go swimming and forgot to tell anybody. Neighbors son was 24 and Danny and Martina’s best friend in that village.\nYes the plantation in Tanzania had elephants and lions roaming around and that was protocol for climbing trees. He was the only white kid there and all his friends were local children. The made up languages were Greek and the local dialect in Tanzania as well as German. Martina and Danny seldom summered in Canada and often also left for the winter. Poor kid spoke at least 3 languages by 6 and often got words confused from one language to the other.\nPoor teachers and principal had to put up with a little elementary school world traveler off and on for 4 years. Lost track of Martina and Danny when a civil war broke out in Rwanda and they never came back to Canada or sent letters.",
      "10": "One of the greatest tools I possess by being an addict in recovery is — I know if you are on drugs. I can pick you out of a crowd of a thousand people with my eyes closed.\nYou. Are. Obvious.\nA few months ago, my girlfriend's oldest son started coming home from school (which let out at 3:00 pm) around 5:30 pm with bloodshot eyes. He would race upstairs, disappear into his room, and not be seen again until the next day at 5:30 pm.\nHis emotions were boiling over at the smallest of things and with each passing day, he would trip my high-dar more and more times.\nAfter a few weeks of this behavior, in my infinite wisdom, I stopped at Walmart and bought a drug test. I was so irritated and ready to burn his ass. In all honesty, I just want my girlfriend's kids to not close the same doors on their lives as I did on mine by using drugs.\nJess and I got home at 4:30 pm. I told her that I bought a drug test and when her son fails it in an hour, we’re taking his car, his phone, his friends and his Xbox.\nShe asked me if I was sure of his drug use. I told her I was. I'm never wrong about it — I am an expert and the leading authority in the Tri-State area on spotting drug use.\nWhen he got home, before he dashed up the stairs, I told him his mother and I wanted to talk to him. He tried that whole angry teenager, manipulative “About what?! I'm busy!!” bull crap and I let him have it.\n“Well, we want to talk to you about your drug use. About how you're smoking weed all the time. Maybe even selling it. About how you can't wake up in the morning for school. About how you're calling off work on the weekends and locking yourself in your room — probably to practice rolling joints and making tinfoil pipes to impress your friends. That's what we're going to talk to you about. So sit down, now, and listen up.”\n“I'm not using drugs. I'm struggling in school, with a class,” as his eyes started to get teary.\n“Doubtful. You're a straight-A student and always have been. Try again.”\nHe was so emotional, he could hardly form a sentence. And as well as I can spot drug use in people, I also see right through fake tears and other bullshit.\n“Here. Here's a cup. Go pee in it right now, in front of your mother.”\nPhew. That really got him hyper.\n“You don't trust me, or believe me? I’ve been getting tutored for two hours every day after school. I come home, lock myself in my room and take notes and study until 2 am. I didn't tell you guys cause I was embarrassed because I am a straight-A student.”\n“Nope. I don't believe it.”\nSo he went and peed in the cup. Yes, in front of his mother.\nIt's only going to be a few minutes until he gets burned. Then — I remove every privilege he's ever had.\nBut, he passed the drug test.\nUmmm, okay?\nJess texted his civics and government teacher. He has been getting tutored every day. He brought his (enormous stack) of notes down from upstairs and showed us what he's been working on. He has been studying and taking notes all night.\nI didn't understand. Not why he was failing Civ and Gov, but how I could be wrong about something I was so sure of.\nI closed the lines of communication when I suspected he was getting high over a month ago. That was definitely a mistake. It cost us, as a family. Had I told Jess that I was suspicious and approached him right away, we wouldn't have lost precious time. We may have been able to support and help him. But I didn't say anything, I waited and he did not pass that class. He may not have passed it anyway, but he deserved more from me. Next week, a straight-A student starts summer school.\nPeople (including children) deserve the benefit of the doubt. Even though I do believe I am an expert when it comes to noticing impaired behavior, that doesn't mean I can't be wrong.\nIn this case I was — he was telling the truth.\nLeon",
      "11": "The worst fight my wife and oldest daughter ever had was when we left her babysitting her siblings one afternoon as we went for lunch. Our eldest loved candles. She was 14, so she was allowed to have them, but only light them when one of us was home. We got home from lunch and as soon as we walked in the door, we could smell a candle.\nMy wife walked into her room and there was a candle on her desk still smoking. So my wife called her into the room and said “What did we tell you about lighting candles when we aren’t home?”\nShe responded that she hadn’t lit a candle. Her mom pointed out the still smoking candle. She still claimed it wasn’t her. Mom opened the top desk drawer and there was the bbq lighter. Again, she claimed it wasn’t her. What had started off as a fairly minor issue, turned into a big fight. My wife was angry that our daughter thought we were that stupid that we would believe it wasn’t her, when all the evidence said it was. Our daughter was adamant that she didn’t light the smoking candle in her room.\nFast forward 14 years, our family is sitting around talking about different memories, and our son (who would have been about five at the time) admits that he lit the candle. Apparently, a couple of weeks before that incident, the oldest had said something he didn’t like. With what we have only recently discovered as his customary patience for vengeance, he waited until we were away, took the lighted from the kitchen, snuck into her room while she was cooking them lunch, waited until he saw us pulling up to the house, lit the candle, let it burn until we got up to the door, snuffed it out, slipped the lighter into her drawer and ran out of her room, down the back stairs, and into his own room.\nHe waited until he was no longer living at home and then admitted to all the ways he had gotten revenge on his siblings over the years. This included waiting until it was an offender’s turn to do dishes and then making sticky muffins without liners and burning the crap out of them so the muffin tin was almost impossible to clean and other petty vengeance that would always wait just long enough for no one to be able to prove he had done it on purpose.\nHis siblings just nodded as he relates everything. They all knew he was diabolical; they just couldn’t prove it.\nEdit: To the supposed”adults” saying horrible things about a child - actually, I raised a gentle, kind, trustworthy young man who is very close to his siblings and a fiercely loyal friend. Unlike some Quora users, people can grow and mature. He was seven and had three sisters who were bigger and liked to boss him around. He adapted to the situation, but he also grew out of it. I am proud of the young man he has become. Maybe don’t judge someone by their actions when they were little. If you never did anything bad when you were young, feel free to throw the first stone.",
      "12": "It was shortly after we moved into the house we’re in now, with a spacious back yard enclosed by a fence. We’d moved from a quiet street to a relatively well-traveled rural highway, so my wife & I both cautioned our boys (then 10 and 13) over and over not to leave the gate open. We had two dogs (still do, but this was 20 years ago, so different dogs) and there was too much risk of them getting out & getting hit by a car.\nThe boys were like, “Yeah, okay, we get it, we get it.” But then… two weeks after we moved in, I looked out into the front yard, and there’s our border collie, Doolin, in the front yard.\nSo I collared the boys and demanded to know which one had left the gate open. Both denied it heatedly. “I know one of you is lying,” I said, “so just own up.”\nThis just made them deny it even more strongly.\n“What, do you think Doolin opened the gate herself?”\nStill no admission of guilt.\nWell, nothing bad had happened, so I decided to let it drop. I just cautioned them sternly that it better not happen again.\nSo I put Doolin back in the back yard, secured the gate, and went back inside…\n… and ten minutes later, there she is again in the front yard.\nThis time I knew the boys had been inside the whole time. So I repeated putting her back in the back yard, latched the gate, and then quietly went up onto our balcony that overlooked the gate.\nAnd… I swear I’m not making this up… Doolin went up to the gate, looked around to make sure no one was watching, stood on her hind legs, pulled up the slide bolt with her teeth, pushed it back, and let herself out.\nI wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it. She’d learned to operate a slide bolt by watching us. We ended up having to put carabiners on the gate latch to keep her corralled. And when we hooked the carabiners on, she’d watch us intently, like, “Damn. If I had opposable thumbs, I could manage those, too.”\nShe remains the single smartest dog I’ve ever owned.",
      "13": "We weren’t well off, and were pretty far from it. My kid was 4 years old and would find little pieces of broken glass or pottery shards and identify them as diamonds and other jewels. Then she would fantasize for a long time about how she would spend the fortune.\nOne weekend, there was an auction down the street and I had $10, so we went. I was looking over the stacks of quilts and towels when my daughter came up and said that she wanted a couple of bucks to bid on a box of jewelry that had a “real diamond ring!” I gave it to her. I mean, how much fun can I have with $2 compared to that? Anyway, she won the bid and there really was a ring with a large diamond set in 14kt gold. How did I know it was real, besides the setting? The stone had a pretty big yellow flaw in it. I have no idea how she picked it out.\nI don’t know what she ever did with it, and it finally disappeared when she was about to get out of grade school. I’m guessing it was stolen by another kid. Yeah, I let her keep it. It was hers. She bought it with part of the $2 she had. She wore that thing on a chain for years.",
      "14": "In the 90's I was a single mom of three great kids, 9 year old twins and an 8 year old daughter. For a short period of time, my brother moved in with my kids and me, as he needed a place to stay while he finished school.\nAnyway, one night, I made the kids dinner, and gave them some fruit punch that was in the pitcher in the fridge to drink with dinner.\nFirst, my daughter started, “This juice tastes funny, I don't like it.”\nTypical, I thought. For some reason, my kids were crazy for orange juice. If the juice wasn't orange juice, they would complain that orange juice was the only juice they liked, and demand that I provide orange juice, as it was the only acceptable juice.\nThen the older (by ten minutes) twin boy chimed in, “Yeah, it's gross.”\nAnd of course, his brother, a kid of few words quickly added his opinion, “Yuck.”\nI had bought the fruit punch because it was on sale, money had been tight since I had split with their father, and every penny counted. After a long tiring day of work, I was not in the mood for an orange juice discussion, “Just drink the juice.” I told them.\nThey all erupted into a cacophony of objections, they were being so obstinate that I got stubborn too. “We're all going to sit right here at this table until the three of you finish every drop of your juice, and I don't care if it takes all night.” I told them.\nMy kids knew me well. I never argued with them if I had any intention whatsoever of giving in.\nThey ate the rest of their dinner in silence. Each of them made sure I knew how much they disliked the juice as they choked it down. The eldest twin was, as usual, the most expressive, going so far as to hold his nose as he drank. When he finished, he set his cup on the table, belched loudly, and said, “Gross.”\nLater that night, after the kids were in bed I was sitting on the couch watching TV, and my brother came in from work. He sat on the armchair in the living room, and we chatted. After about half an hour he stood up, “I'm hungry.” he said.\n“I saved you a plate of dinner, its in the microwave.” I said as he was walking into the kitchen.\nI could hear him rooting around in the fridge as I passed through the kitchen intending to go to bed. As I passed him, he looked up from his search and said, “Aw man…is the fruit punch gone?”\n“Yeah, it's gone,” I said, “But there's some more in the freezer if you want to mix it up.”\nHe looked at me disappointedly, “Ok…” he said with a sigh, “But I may as well just drink water, I poured all the rest of the vodka in the last batch.”\nIn the morning, I apologized to my kids.\nPS- For those of you who asked, I didn't taste the juice, I sniffed it, and it smelled fine. After this incident, I definitely tasted any food or drink that someone else complained to me about.",

My mum said she had no other child, and that Stephanie was the name of a doll I had.\nMy mum asked me why told my minder that lie.

My mum told me there was no baby, but I insisted there was because I heard about it. She tried to tell me about the difference between lies and the truth, and fantasy and real life.

      "23": "When my daughter was little: “Mommy.. Moooommmy…. MOMMY. Can you please take me to the bathroom (again) because there’s a dead girl in there. I see her so I’m not wanting to use the potty alone without someone at least outside the door.”\nI didn’t believe her… Nights went on with disagreements about whether she’d take a bath and if so, if she’d do it on her own. I don’t even want to go into the sleeping issues. She basically had to sleep in with me and a good amount of time she’d throw a fit and call my mother to drive across town and pick her up to stay the night at her house instead because of “the ghosts.” My mom is a typical grandma so she always relented. She would always drag her toys out of her play room and bedroom into the living room just to not be in close proximity to seeing possible ghosts. Eventually we sold the house thankfully to people who actually liked the idea of a ghost. My skeptical ex and my mother saw the ghost however she never materialized in front of me. (Probably because she knew I’d be removing her permanently had I seen her.) I sensed something but I was frightened of property values, bringing in true proof would have been a tough thing to deal with and at the time in my youth I preferred to assume it was not a ghost, rather, it was my own poor parenting skills somehow causing my child to think a ghost was there. But yes, I eventually got proof enough and decided to sell.\nIt was my family who convinced me to sell along with the fact that shortly after experiencing the “ghost” for himself, my ex-husband moved his things from our home, refused to go back inside and refused to help make the payments. I suppose perhaps he was trying to make a point… I loved that house, though.\nMy husband had been in the kitchen doing something at the counter like food prep and picking stuff up from the floor. My daughter and I pulled into the driveway and I left her in the car with the food while I unlocked the door. My then husband said from the kitchen, “Didn’t you just run by here with such force wearing some weird old blue and greenish dress and some crazy gray wig that you knocked all the pictured off the refrigerator…and ran into the laundry room behind me and slammed the door? How’d you get outside, anyway?” I replied, “No, we just pulled in.” We both checked the laundry room that had no other way out, it was empty. Shortly thereafter he basically fled. And, we sold.\nWhen my daughter was 17: “Mommy. If I’d had my 17 year-old brain back when I was younger and we were living in that house, I’d have screamed my head off. It started with that thing that used to visit me in my bed, in the crib whose name was “Busy.” Or something that sounded like that. What was that creature anyway? Then the dead girl…you never believed me. WHY didn’t you believe me, you know I don’t lie, why did you let us live there?”\nI felt just horrible.",
      "24": "I’m a mother with two young children. They were always full of energy and had wild imaginations, so I was used to hearing some pretty outlandish stories from them. But I never expected what my son would tell me while we were on a family vacation in Mexico.\nWe were lounging on the beach, enjoying the sun and the waves when my son suddenly came running up to me. He was panting and wide-eyed, and he told me that he had just seen a shark swimming around in the water. I was skeptical, of course. The lifeguards hadn't said a thing about a shark, and the water seemed perfectly calm. I thought he was just imagining things or playing a prank on me.\nBut then, a group of people started shouting and pointing towards the water. I followed their gaze and saw a dark fin cutting through the surface not far from the shore. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that my son had been telling the truth all along.\nThe lifeguards quickly sprang into action, blowing their whistles and waving their flags to alert the other beachgoers. They called for everyone to get out of the water and cleared the beach. We watched as the lifeguards safely guided the shark back out to sea.\nIt was a scary moment, but it was also a valuable lesson for me as a mother. I learned to trust my children's words and to always take them seriously, even if their stories seem hard to believe.",
      "25": "One evening, about 10 pm our 14 year old daughter came downstairs and told us that there was someone in the paddock. We assured her she was mistaken and that it was probably someone on the road next to it coming home from the pub. She insisted. We told her to just go back to bed. The next morning, her Dad discovered our lawnmower had been stolen from the old stable in the corner of the paddock. We apologised to her, and told her we were wrong for doubting her. We've never been allowed to forget it.",
      "26": "I was the child.\nMy family and extended family were on a daytrip at the beach. After lunch the children were sent off to play. On the wet shore, just out of reach of the waves, my cousins and I found an ideal spot and started building a sandcastle. When our moat was ready, we trotted happily back and forth from our sandcastle to fetch water, engrossed in the fun of filling up our rather deep moat.\nOn one of the trips I spotted a swimmer, some distance away in the waves, his back towards us. When I returned, he was much closer, floating by gazing at us vaguely. I was mesmerized.\n6 year-old me pondered a few things in that dream-like, accepting way of children: How beautifully his shiny black hair rippled and floated in the seagreen waves … was this a merman? What lovely, smooth skin … he looks just like a movie star. Doesn't the saltwater sting his eyes? Maybe he is a merman?! I did find it odd, though, that this beautiful creature allowed the waves to roll him about like a giant doll.\nI called my cousin over to show her my intriguing discovery. She, also 6, found him fascinating, too. We watched curiously for a while.\nSuddenly, I realised that something wasn't right. Even with his eyes wide open, he didn't seem to see us waving at him. I ran to my uncle, the nearest adult, and told him what we saw. I may have mentioned mermaids. My cousin, hopping up and down excitedly, corroborated my story to her dad. Brushing us off impatiently, he sternly told us to stop talking nonsense about people with beautiful floating hair.\nSubdued, we wandered back to our sandcastle and sat down. It didn't seem so fun anymore. I wondered why our merman annoyed my uncle. The sun dimmed as clouds began to gather. Heads on our knees, we watched the waves to see if we could spot our merman again.\nSome time later, my dad, a weekend lifeguard, got to hear about my story . He immediately swam out with a few other adults to check. They didn't find anyone - our eerie person had disappeared by then.\nTwenty minutes later, a bunch of serious looking people approached our family group. They asked if perhaps we had spotted an 18 year-old boy. He had gone just beyond the breakers and had been swept away by a riptide. The mom wept silently, she feared him drowned.\nMy uncle apologetically told them that their boy had been spotted by the children, but the adults hadn't taken them seriously; young children tend to make up stories.\nThe body of that beautiful young man was recovered further up the beach, some hours later.\nI'm still cross with my uncle for not taking us seriously that day.\nHow to Stay Safe Around Rip Currents\n\nKnow how to identify a rip current.\nThere are a number of ways you can identify a possible rip current without actually getting in it.\nA rip current is a relatively narrow channel of water, seldom more than 50–100 feet (15.2–30.5 m) in width, usually running from the beach straight out to the sea.\nSince you cannot see the whole shape of the current from the shore, look for a streak of water with one or more of these suspicious characteristics:\nA dirty or muddy appearance from churning up the seabed. You might see seaweed or debris moving rapidly away from shore.\nAn unusually calm area of water, including a gap in the line of breaking waves.\nWater with a different color than its surroundings, or a foamy surface.\nLower waterline on shore at that spot.\nCredit: Wikihow for riptide information",
      "27": "I don't know how “outlandish” this is, but it's a story that my kids still remind me of if I question the validity of something they think they saw.\nI have 5 children: 3 boys, each about 2 years apart, then a 4 year gap between them and my boy girl twins. All of the children were playing in our rather large backyard on a late summer's day. It was just about dusk, when the twins (who were about 5 years old) came running over to me as I sat on the front porch.\n“Mom!! There are 2 owls in the bush by the swings!!”\n“Oh that's awesome!”\nI pay little attention. What would 2 (let alone 1!) owls be doing in a bush (not a tree) while it's still daylight? “They *think* they saw owls.” I say to myself.\nIt's true that despite our technically living in the city, we are located on the outskirts, with quite a bit of acreage. We live in an old farm house that my great grandparents raised my grandfather and his siblings in. During the Depression they sold off most of the land and when my grandfather was 17 years old, he began building brick duplexes on the property. The idea was that he and his siblings would always have a place to live and a small income from the rent. Now his grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great granchilden are still living in these homes. He would be proud.\nRight. So there's a good bit of property here and we do see lots of wildlife, yet it had been some time since anyone had seen an owl. My great-uncle buddy is pictured in this yard with all maner of pet wildlife. He never caged them, but he'd train the animals and feed them by hand. Everything from opossums and deer to yes, owls. Yet, despite my living in this house my entire life and being in my mid forties when this took place, I had never seen an owl.\nLater that evening the older boys told me that they had seen the owls in the bush. I trusted that they believed this what they saw but still chalked it up to misidentification because they claimed the owls were white. Uncle Buddy was pictured with what I think is a great horned owl, and as far as I knew, white owls were not a thing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nLo and behold, later that evening, in the wee hours of the morning, I opened the front door to go outside to have a cigarette and staring at me, from atop my grill, was the cutest, fluffiest little white owl!\n￼\nThe wee one was probably a bit paralyzed in fear. I was paralyzed in awe. It was no more than 2 feet from me. Once it realized “Sranger danger!” it flew, in absolute silence, to the little stone walkway leading to our fruit shanty. There, on the walkway was the sweety’s sibling.\nGoogle stock photos of 2 baby barn owls\nThe two stayed there for a solid minute before silently flying into the dark.\nIt was a magical experience. I became obsessed with finding out what type of owls these were. Found out that they're barn owls and their mama had built a nest in the roof of our back porch! What a mess, but so worth it!\nI did a bunch of research and found that the weird rattlesnake sound I've been hearing at night all my life, were barn owls.\nI haven't seen any since then, but I have aspirations of one day building a barn owl box with a camera inside.\nThe kids were not imagining things that day. Their mother however, lacked the imagination to take them seriously. As I said earlier, they remind me of this, when I forget.\nHere are some pics of uncle Buddy with his owl.\nYounger Buddy 👆\nolder Buddy👇\nBuddy’ s friend with Buddy's owl",
      "28": "When my kids were young - they were 2, 4, and 5 - my son and oldest daughter (the 4 and 5 year olds) used to tell me that a snake was in the kitchen, or a snake went under the sofa. We lived in a drafty old (it was around 30 years old when we moved in) doublewide in a field in the woods, so it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.\nBut search as I might, I never saw a snake.\nThe snake sightings continued. Funny that only the kids see it but not their dad or me, I thought.\nOne night to humor them I sprinkled flour between the living room and kitchen. The next morning there were no snake tracks in the flour.\nYou see, I told the children. There is no snake.\nOne afternoon I was assembling a lasagna and the kids were in my bedroom playing a Blue’s Clues early reader game on my computer. My son came into the kitchen and said, Mommy? in a scared little voice.\nBear in mind that my kids are 1/4 Yupik and have a lovely light olive skin tone.\nWhen I looked at my son, he was white as a sheet.\nMommy, when I was on the compooter, a black snake crawled across my feet.\nI threw the lasagna ingredients into the counter and stormed down the hall, determined to set this snake myth to rights once and for all. I was positive he had touched a computer cable and his imagination turned it into a snake.\nImagine my surprise when there really was a black snake under my computer desk!\nUnfortunately for the snake, I botched my attempt to wrangle it into a wicker laundry basket and it ended up in a corner, striking every time I approached. Rather than do the smart thing and use a broom to push it into the basket, I cut it’s head off. I’m still ashamed of myself for that.",
      "29": "I have one concerning me as a little boy in the early 1970’s. When I was in the second grade (7 years old), our teacher was focusing on teaching about the world and geography in a small town in southern Georgia. The first lesson was about the great outback in northern Australia. As she was talking, I explained to the rest of the class on how vast and wild in could be since my family had taken many journeys into it. She let that one go since I had a weird accent at the time.\nThe next lesson was on the beach in the Fiji islands. As she was discussing it, I told them that the water was the color she described and the beaches were as pristine as she had noted. Now she was getting a little flustered, but she let it go.\nNext, she went into the Great Canadian Shield and how rugged it was. As she was talking, I noted that she was right … it is rocky and hard to get soil since I had been there.\nAfter class, she had me stay over to discuss things. She noted that a vivid imagination is nice, but you can’t deceive your fellow classmates like that. But I responded, “Seriously, I had been to all of those places.” Well, she noted that she had no choice than to contact my parents.\nShe called my mother to explain the situation. My mother responded that yes, I had been to all of those places. She said that it was not right to indulge my fantasies like that. Then my mother offered to come to school to discuss it futher.\nMy mother brought the family album that she had at the time. There I was in one photo in the outback of Australia - a place where I lived from ages 3 to 6. There was the photo of me on the beaches of Fiji, a place where we stopped when we were coming back from Australia to the United States. Finally, there was the photo of me on the Freat Canadian Shield when I had come back to the US … my grandparent had a cottage in Pointe Au Baril in Ontario … and a one week old, my mother had taken me there since she wanted to recover from birthing there.\nMy teacher apologized … and I know where she was coming from so I totally understand. She was 70 years old and had never left southern Georgia, and it just blew her mind that a child could have gone all those places at an early age. She became my favorite teacher of all time, and to this day I miss her deeply.\nLater on in life, I met children of military parents, and they told me if their travels that blew my mind. In fact, my wife was born in Uzbekistan, and the places she has been pales me in comparison. (One was also in Australia). Anyway, the story brings a smile to me to this day when I think of it.",
      "30": "A couple of decades ago, our house, which is now in the heart of the city, used to be pretty secluded and there were open fields all around. During Monsoon, there'd be water and greenery all around.\nOn such a rainy day, my two year old daughter was sitting on the floor, next to my bed. She was eating bread and was throwing some pieces under the bed, while talking to herself.\nI asked her what she was doing and she replied very non-chalantly -\"Woh bahut bhuka hai, main use bread khila Rahi hoon\" ( \"He is very hungry I am feeding him bread\").\nI thought she was feeding our pet dog and didn't bother too much. And in the next moment, I saw the dog walking in the room from the door, he was barking deafeningly loud. I knew something was wrong then and bent down to peep under the bed.\nTo my horror, I saw a python coiled under the bed in a corner! My little daughter did not like it at all when I sweeped her off the floor and fled the room.\nMy daughter is a well established ecologist and a wildlife conservationist now. I should have seen this coming that day.\nFast forward, she spends a lot of her time in jungles where there is no mobile network coverage. Sometimes I don't hear from her for days. And when I do hear from her, she tells me stories about crossing a river bed walking on stones crunching under her feet that she later found out were actually crabs. And about leech bite marks on her legs.\nThat day years ago, when she was feeding bread to a snake with no sense of danger, should have prepared me for all this. But you all know how it goes with parents and worrying, right?",

      "32": "We were having a quiet dinner as a family, near my office in downtown San Francisco on a warm May evening. It was a nice but not fancy place. The ground floor was pretty crowded so when we were invited to choose our own seats, my 8 year old son bolted to the upper dining area. We followed him upstairs, which was basically empty except for a group of a dozen or so men at a table in the middle of the floor. We walked past them and settled into a secluded side booth.\nYoung son kept peeking at that other group. Eventually he said quietly, “That's LeBron James.” Ridiculous! We ignored him. I didn't even look more closely for myself.\nThe other group eventually left. When the waitress later brought our check she asked how we'd enjoyed dining with the Cleveland Cavaliers before their NBA finals run. They were apparently staying in the hotel across the street. Young son answered her but the rest of us just sat in stupid silence.\nWhen young son tells us what he sees now, we all listen a lot more closely!",

So we ask my 7 year old son (who apparently watches more nature documentaries than we realized) what the animal was. After a thoughtful pause he says “it’s a Pangolin.”\nWe chuckled, assuming he felt obligated to answer on the spot and tried to extemporaneously come up with an answer (though this would not be his MO)- so we fact checked. Sure as hell, there certainly is such thing as a pangolin. It’s endearing the information they retain.",
      "34": "Not my kid but my niece. We have a connection since she’s been in the world, though. I was visiting once and she told me she was woken up by a light glaring into her room from the window. She looked out and saw a cigar shaped object hovering in the sky until it sped off. I didn't think she was lying but I did think she dreamed it. She was all excited and gave great detail so I really wasn't sure what to think. I discounted it as maybe she mistook what she saw and there was a better explanation than the UFO one. Anyway, forgot about it, not to bother my mind long. Then I moved to the same town maybe like 10 years later. I was listening to the news one night and they started talking about the cigar shaped object that had been reported to authorities by many people some years before and they had never been able to explain it. This was the first I had heard that other people saw it too. Weird. What WAS that anyway?",
      "35": "I am lucky enough not to have to worry about my kids telling outlandish lies. Even when I think they might be, it's always something small. But, last week I was visiting with an old friend, who told me a funny story about when he was a kid.\nAs a kid, he frequently got in trouble for lying, so his parents never believed him when he wasn't. One night he was told not to go outside, but there was snow on the ground and he snuck out of his bedroom window and went sledding. It's a small town with one hill where everyone else in the town was sledding also. An older lady who was there sledding down the hill too, flew off of her sled and broke her hip. Well, my friend, a young boy at the time, was a gentleman and helped her to a car where they could get her to the hospital, as she tells him, “thank you young man for saving my life!”\nSo this young boy, feeling good about himself for “saving a ladies life”, immediately walked home. Excited about just having “saved a ladies life”, he forgot entirely about having just snuck out of his bedroom window to go sledding, that he walked right in through the front door.\nGreeted by his dad as soon as he stepped inside, “Where in the hell have you been?”\n“Dad, I just saved a ladies life!”\n“No you didn't, you little lying son of bitch!”\n“Dad no, but I really saved a ladies life!”\nHis dad goes, grabs his belt, and my friend as a young boy, get his ass whipped with a belt, the whole time as he is getting swatted with the belt, “I swear, I just saved a ladies life!” as he's crying, trying to get him to believe him.\nAfter his dad gets done whipping his ass, his dad leaves him in the room where my friend is still sitting in and crying because he just got his ass whipped with a belt for lying.\nAll of a sudden, their doorbell rings. His dad goes and answers the door. “Hi sir, we are the [small town newspaper] and we are here to talk to the little town hero who just saved a ladies life!

It seemed that this particular sick teacher wanted to take her rage over my wife when she was about seven years old.\nOne mid-day break the teacher made my wife stay in class and all the other students left to go and play as usual, My wife usually went home as they lived near the school. Feeling enclosed in this class which was a second-story building, my wife as a young girl, decided to tie all the aprons of the other children together to make a rope, then opened the window, and after tying one end of the “ rope “ to a deck she lowered herself about 24 feet through a hand to hand grip while her legs tried to capture the knots she made to hold the aprons together,\nMy wife went home after climbing another school wall and went home later than usual, When her mother heard what her daughter said, she did not believe her and decided to go to school to see what really happened, When my mother-in-law arrived at school with her daughter there was havoc at the school after someone saw the apron rope still hanging out of the window,\nMy mother-in-law was rather angry at all this and even the headmaster of the school could not believe that one sick teacher could do such an action against a small child, My wife still looks back and remembers it all, but one of the issues that hurt her most was the fact that her own mother and her sisters would not believe her.

It was a field of a uniform green crop, sloping down to the bottom of a small valley, and the far side of the valley was the same green crop up to the skyline where there was an irregular hedgerow. Nothing cow-shaped, nothing blue (except for the cloudless sky). He was still very young, but I was sure he knew the meaning of the words “blue” and “cow”. I looked carefully but I couldn’t figure it out.\nI said “where’s the blue cow?” and he replied “over there”, staring across the field (he was so young he didn’t know how to point). What could he see that I couldn’t?\nI knelt down and put my chin on his shoulder to try to see from his point of view and I saw it! Very small, in the distance, a brilliant blue cow-like image.\nIt was the blue sky, seen through a cow-shaped hole in the hedge a couple of hundred meters away.

It really never took much longer than an hour, and everything was vacuumed and tidied - news papers tossed in the bin, old junk mail thrown away, everything organized etc. Easy peasey.

I feel like 95% of child-dom when confronted with an angry parent asking “WHO DID THIS?” responds either “I dunno?” Or “It was (insert name of little brother)! I saw him!” I’m absolutely certain I did that, but I never told anybody something horrible happened to me or somebody else or anything like that. Still, though, I was just a big liar.\nWhen I was maybe 8 or 9, I had a friend over. We were playing in my room upstairs when we heard a weird noise, and then suddenly this GIANT crow flew over our heads. Inside. In my bedroom. Now my dad had all the doors and windows open since he was refinishing the floor in the kitchen and entryway downstairs, so no big surprise. My friend wanted to catch it but I figured we should probably say something before the thing crapped on the carpet or somebody’s bed. Besides we’d been told we had to stay upstairs so we didn’t step in whatever it was he was putting on the tile and track it through the house, and all the nets my dad owned (he was a fisherman) and the broom were downstairs. So I poke my head downstairs. “Uh….dad? There’s a big crow up here. I think it’s in your bedroom now.”\n”Stop lying,” he says, and goes back to work.\n“No really,” I say, “you need to come up here. Bring a broom or your big net or something. It’s gonna break something!” By now the crow has flown over my head twice and into his room. I can hear it hitting the big windows in there, trying to get out. THUMP. THUMP. It was not a small bird.\n“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT LYING!” he says without looking up.\n“I’M NOT LYING!” I yell back. “THERE IS A CROW AND ITS GOING TO CRAP ON YOUR CARPET IF YOU DON’T GET IT OUT!”\nBy now my friend is standing at the top of the stairs with me and adds, “It’s really here, I saw it too!”\nMy dad grumbles something about me roping other kids into my web of deceitful lies and stomps upstairs. The crow chooses this moment to make a dive for his shiny bald head. He’s cussing and flapping his arms and trying to drive it out the balcony door.\nMy friend chose this exact moment to say “WE TOLD YOU SO!”\nAnother one. I was in middle school and I ran up this huge mound of snow in slip-on shoes. Near the top I sunk about waist deep into the snow and of the shoes came off. I looked for it for the rest of recess. Shovel and everything. Didn’t find it. Looked after school. No luck. My mom and I drove back there and looked again. No shoe. For whatever reason, my parents decided that because I didn’t like the shoes, I on purpose threw one away and then lied about it to get a new pair. Again, because I was this big liar who never told the truth about anything and now was “manipulative” and “sneaky” too. Never mind that I was 11 and picked the shoes out myself because while they weren’t stylish they were comfortable, and I hadn’t liked the last pair of stylish shoes I had.\nAn angry trip to the shoe store at the mall (where I bought the same pair of shoes with my own money, only with a higher back so they couldn’t fly off, but same color and same style) and two months later, and there was MY FUCKING SHOE, lying in a puddle all wet and discolored. It must have been buried really well in that huge snow mound, since it didn’t show up until the damn thing melted, but that’s exactly where it was. Maybe if my parents hadn’t reminded me what a giant liar I was every day for two months, or even if they’d apologized, I wouldn’t have been so mad about it. As it was I wore that demented sad ruined shoe with its nice new looking partner every day, just to make them mad, until ironically they forced me to throw it away.",
      "48": "It actually happened to nephews of mine. They lived next to some woods and a farm. The woods belonged to the farmer, but the kids played in them all the time.\nOne day the kids come running in, saying call the police. They were totally scared. Told everyone in the house to get away from the windows, and that they saw a sniper in the woods.\nWell naturally our first thought was a hunter. But the kids had seen hunters, and even hunted a bit themselves. They said no way, this guy had a 50 cal riffle with a scope, no orange as required by law and common sense, and was covered in a ghillie suit (basically covered in plants to blend in).\nNow we could believe a hunter was trespassing as no hunting was allowed on that property. We could believe the lack of orange as there are plenty of idiots around. But a 50 cal with a scope seemed unlikely. However when they mentioned a ghillie suit, we all decided they must be using their imagination.\nWe try to convince one of the kids to show us where the “imaginary” sniper was, but they were to terrified. We go out and look ourselves but don’t see anything. And basically tell the kids that it was all in their imagination.\nAt 6 am the next morning, shortly after sunrise all hell breaks loose. A helicopter is flying right over heard. 10 police cruisers and a swat team show up. Even 2 cops on ATVs that I have no idea where came from. We’re all up watching this mess unfold, when one of the kids says, “I told you so” and points. Sure enough, coming out of the woods was a man wearing a ghillie suit carrying a 50 cal with a scope.\nTLDR - Kids playing in the woods saw a “sniper”. No one beloved them until the next day when the police raided a nearby drug house, and the sniper came out of the woods",
      "49": "I was driving with two of my grandchildren ages five and six one day when they suddenly became very quiet.\nStrangely calm, they told me there was a spider beside my head.\nYeah right, I thought. They were always telling me something, and they were too calm for it to be the truth.\nNevertheless, I turned my head and … oh. My. God.\nEight inches from my head was the ugliest thing I have ever seen.\nA square spider.\nI did manage to stay calm long enough to pull the car over, get out and knock the spider out of the car with a piece of paper.\nThat would have been a good one to save, but unfortunately that was not an option.\nAfter that I was a little quicker to listen when the kids told me something.\nUPDATE: The reason I didn't believe the kids at first was because ordinarily they would have been yelling “Spider! Spider!” It is possible that the appearance of the spider was so shocking that even the kids just got quiet.\nIt is interesting that they did identify it as a spider even though the body shape was nothing like that of an everyday spider.",
      "50": "Hmmm… well this involved me when I was a teenager. So here it goes:\nMy family went to Sydney for the week while my older sister and I stayed back home (we lived in northern NSW at the time). I made an agreement with my sister that I would clean the house and keep the yard clean, and that in return she will cook for me as I didn’t know how to cook at the time.\nI kept my end of the deal and she DID NOT! The only home cooked meal I had that week was courtesy of her boyfriend.\nAnyway, so on the day that my family were due to arrive, I was especially tired so I decided to leave the cleaning for a bit later.\nLo and behold, my family arrive home earlier than expected. The dogs had decided to do a weeks worth of shit that very afternoon, the house was a complete mess from just that day (somehow), and sometime in the previous 3 hours the fish decided that he has had enough of this life and went to heaven.\nAfter my dad came home and surveyed the damage, he began yelling at me for letting the place fall apart. I insisted that I had been diligently cleaning all week.\nDad gives me this “I’m not buying it” look as he said “so you’re telling me that the dogs did a weeks worth of shit JUST THIS AFTERNOON, that all this mess was from today, and the fish died only moments before we got home?”\n“… YES!!!!”\nI feebly tried explaining myself, but soon gave up and decided to accept my fate when I realised that the evidence was stacked against me and that not even I would believe this story if someone else told it to me…"

      "2": "Beating Russia and China into obedience wouldn't be possible without commiting nuclear suicide. China and Russia have enough nuclear weapons to hit every Western mid-sized to large city, military base, and center that routes a large volume of internet traffic. The US can't touch North Korea without a military response from Russia. Furthermore, if the US military attacked North Korea, the North Korean military would level Seoul, South Korea with an artillery barrage.\nVenezuela has armed its citizens against a US invasion. You've seen how the US performed in wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Venezuelan guerrilla fighters would also hand the US its ass. Besides, in 2019, there was an attempted American coup of Venezuela. Some of those Americans are still held in captivity in Venezuela, not that I care. If you try to overthrow a government, you should bear the consequences.\nI wish the US weren't involved in Israel. Nothing good for Americans will ever come of it. The US sends Israel military aid, and Israel gives its citizens healthcare and a college education that no poor or middle-class American could afford.\nLargely, the US is incapable of beating countries into obedience, as you put it.",

Such as the U.S. says I will bomb the shit out of your Nord Stream pipeline so that you cannot buy energy from Russia and buys it from the U.S. at 3 times your cost from Russia!\nDon’t stop at those countries you singled out. Actually you are right about something. The U.S. wants the entire world to be submissive and subservient to them. In 1945 those nations have no choice. By 2000 the U.S. barely can survive by 2023.

      "9": "That's a rather big mix of countries, so it's doubtful “we” need two (more) world wars to “beat” China, Russia, Palestine, Venezuela, and North Korea into submission.\nFirst of all, what's that joke about what weapons will be used in the next world war after World War III?\nActually, from his statement, Albert Einstein did know what weapons would probably be used in World War III—nuclear weapons. If that's the case, civilization and our technologies would be gone.. but yes, no more worries from those countries— or any other countries, for that matter.\nWhat we need to see from this is we don’t get two chances to fix our present world with nuclear weapons nations on opposing sides.\nBTW, None of the countries mentioned were aligned with Germany or the Axis nations.\nChina, North Korea, and Russia have nuclear weapons, while Palestine and Venezuela don't.\nThis may be simplistic, but three countries with nuclear weapons won't be easy to deal with.\nWe'll have to learn how to deal with the countries we know without beating them into submission or obedience So we might have to do something radical, while protecting ourselves through strength, and then we might find ways to negotiate with them.\nSo we don't get two more world wars to fix our conflicts. We're better off using the alliances we have and should stand up to aggressive actions of rogue nations— without provoking a world war or a full scale nuclear exchange.\nHow to do that?\nGood question.",
      "10": "The main force that defeated Germany was not the United States at all, but the Soviet Union, the predecessor of Russia. Shameless Yanks are thieves who have been stealing the glory of the Soviet Union.\n1. Both world wars took place not on the American continent, but on the Eurasian continent.\nThe United States escaped unscathed in both world wars and took advantage of the war opportunities to provide military supplies to Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire, making a fortune and becoming the only country after World War II that made huge profits without war losses.\nThis is also the reason why the U.S. economy developed rapidly after WWII.\nThe \"baby boomers\" was the result of a strong postwar economy, in which Americans felt confident they would be able to support a larger number of children.\n2. It was the Soviets who rescued Europeans from the Nazis, otherwise Europeans today would speak German, not the United States that saved Europe.\nthe Soviets were regularly battling more than 200 German divisions. In contrast,the Americans and British fghting in the Medfterranean rarely confronted more than 10 German divisions.\nGermany lost over six million men fighting the Soviets and approximately one million fighting on the Western front.\nThough the myth lives on that the United States won World War Ⅱ, serious historians agree that it was the Soviet Union and its entire society, the defeat of the monster German war machine. But as the cold war descended, the laurels of the U.S.S.R.'s victory over Nazi Germany were stolen.\nIt would take another 20 years for another U.S president and veteran - John F. Kennedy, who had lived his entire life in some degree of pain and with the prospect of death to pay homage to the Soviet contribution in World War Ⅱ.\nCommencement Address, American University June 10,1963\nNo nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet union in the second world war. At least 20 million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and families were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's territory, including two-thirds of its industrial base, wassturned into a wasteland - A loss equivalent to the destruction of this country east of Chicago.\n3. It was China that successfully weakened the Japanese Empire at the cost of 20 million sacrifices and prevented Japan from advancing westward into Europe on the Asian battlefield.\nThere are no large-scale American soldiers on the main battlefield in Asia, but countless Chinese soldiers and civilians use crude weapons to resist the expansion of the Japanese empire.\nThe scale of the guerrilla warfare the Japanese encountered on the Chinese battlefield was 100 times the scale of the guerrilla warfare between NATO and the Taliban.\nIf Afghanistan is the \"Graveyard of Empires\" after WWII, then China is the \"Graveyard of Empires\" during WWII.\n4. The United States played only an insignificant role from beginning to end, and it only entered the war at the turning point of WWII when the Axis powers (Nazi Germany, Japanese Empire) were severely weakened.\nThe main battlefield of the US military is the Pacific Islands, but the scale of the war in the Pacific Islands is relatively small and cannot be called the main battlefield of WWII. Americans themselves call it \"Island hopping\".",

      "1": "Imagine you have decided to carry out a mass shooting. For whatever reason, you've decided that multiple acts of murder are perfectly acceptable. You've decided that committing the most heinous of all crimes, is peachy keen. Do you really think such a person is going to be stopped because someone draws an imaginary line around a structure, and declares, “Guns are not allowed past this point! You can be arrested if you possess a gun in this area!”?\nQuite the contrary. Such a declaration tells would be mass murderers that this place, protected by imaginary lines and harshly worded signs, is a place utterly free from folks who might step up and stop such an atrocity. It is not surprising that more than 90% of mass shootings have occurred in “Gun Free\" zones, since such a term became popular.\nCriminals are defined by their willingness to break laws.\nIncluding idiotic ones declaring areas to be “Gun Free\".\nJust my $0.02",
      "2": "Simple answer to your question is, they are criminals and don’t follow societal laws.",

Or do you gauge whether a cop is in the area, and maybe speed up a little? Why’d that happen?\nBecause the law doesn’t magically bring compliance.\nThe law is merely what society has decided is a rule to abide by, and lists the punishment if you break the rule. For some people, if the rule is something they don’t care about, they just ignore it.\nRape, murder, and theft are against the law, and yet they still happen.\nIt’s the same with gun free zones. No shooter is going to look at the “gun free zone” signs and say, “Crap. I can’t shoot up the school. It’s a gun free zone.”\nSo how do they get onto school property? They walk up, ignore the sign, and go in. Only the law abiding go in unarmed, but those who want to shoot up the place will not let a sign deter them. They know if they go in, they are the only ones armed, and resistance will be futile.\nBut if there was a way to make it where they are checked for guns, and have armed guards to stop them, shootings would all but disappear.",

      "7": "I’m going to assume you really are as naive as your question implies and try to explain it in simple terms.\nFirst: what is a gun free zone? It’s someplace someone has posted a sign saying they don’t allow guns. Now you need to remember that a sign has no self awareness, has no mobility (it can’t reach out and stop anybody), and will only be obeyed by someone who wishes to obey it.\nNow here’s the tricky part: if someone wishes to carry a gun into a gun free zone, that person will not wish to obey the sign. They will proceed to carry a gun past the sign.\nUnderstand now?\nBut wait: there’s another point here. Just because someone carries a gun, it doesn’t mean they want to shoot anyone. I’m reminded of an interesting quote I heard several years ago. I’m not trying to be crude here, just trying to make the point. Anyway, a reporter asked someone who was teaching gun safety if he was concerned about equipping people to be murderers. His reply was along the lines of “You’re equipped to be a prostitute. Are you?”\nIt’s not the gun, it’s the intent of the person carrying the gun. There was a recent school attack where the perpetrator used a knife and attacked several students. If it was the weapon that was at fault, why is nobody calling for the removal of kitchen knives?\nIn Israel, schools are not gun free zones. In fact, guns are required (by security or teachers). There have been exactly two school shooting in 45 years in Israel. Both were stopped by teachers TRAINED to stop active shooters. And yes, the teachers used guns. Please also note the teachers didn’t go around between shootings and start shooting up the schools, either - or there would have been a lot more shootings.",
      "8": "TLDR: They walk past the sign with the gun.\nContrary to popular leftist ideology that everyone obeys signs because of they don't they be cancelled, they don't.\nUnfortunately because of extremely high quality education system some people can't even read the signs. And many of those who can choose not to obey the signs anyway. Maybe it's because they have a problem with authority. Maybe it's because they won't be told what to do by a piece of metal nailed to the wall, or taped onto the door. Maybe it's because they don't care and want to shoot someone.\nMany liberals are incapable of comprehending this type of thought, the concept is so foreign to them it might as well be from another planet. Seriously someone can choose to do something even when they're told not to. I mean isn't that why movie theaters have a no outside food policy. Because they need to sell you an $8 bag of M&M's. No thank you, I'm stopping at Walmart in the way there and buying my own bag of M&M's for a lot less than $8. And I am smuggling it into the theater.\nMaybe next they'll solve murder with a no murdering sign, or McDonalds could end it's terrible turnover rate by putting up a sign that forbids it's employees from quitting. They just need a fancy sign and it will completely solve the problem. Sorry new McDonalds employee you can't quit because we denied your leave to see you dying grandmother we need someone to man the fryer. Whose going to salt the French fries if we just let people leave. No sign no matter how big forbidding a behavior is going to make me comply if I don't want to.",

      "13": "Funny thing is, I suspect if they were carrying a bible, they would be stopped at the property line.\nBut the question was:\n“How do school shooters get guns onto school property if they are gun free zones?”\nEasy one, they walk right past the gun free zone sign, because just ahead is that target rich environment they have been dreaming of for so long. A place where they can kill everyone they want, and nobody is likely to be able to do anything about it.\nThat is a temporary thing though, someone WILL call men with guns, (the police), to deal with them.\nDepending on location, that could be an hour or so, so basically, they get all that killing done.",

In another, the killer entered through a door was supposed to be locked. In other cases the killers just came to school and walked in.\nConsider the cartoon. Unless there is an armed office behind the door, many people will die.",
      "15": "Basically, the same way that they would get guns onto school property even if they were NOT “gun free zones”. Signs and 1000 foot gun free school zone circles on a map are only effective in preventing decent people from going about their perfectly ordinary affairs while bearing arms, which the Constitution recognizes as a right and commands NOT TO BE INFRINGED. It prevents concerned Samaritans from helping to make schools and surrounding neighborhoods safer. It prevents school staff from discretely carrying a handgun just in case of the rare instances of crazies trying to rack up a body count of innocent kids. These Gun Free Slaughter Zones are nice safe places to do a mass murder, followed after a half hour to an hour of eventual suicide by cop.\nSo just think about it for a minute. Politicians, high level business people, media stars, famous athletes, and the wealthy and powerful, either have guns or have armed bodyguards. Is the President’s life worth more than mine? Yours? Hell no. We are supposed to be equally important in the eyes of God and our fellow man. How about that jewelry store, or bank, with armed security...",

      "20": "Actually a shooter is COUNTING on the fact that they are gun free zones. See, these “gun free zones” are excellent at keeping the law abiding disarmed. WHICH means that a shooter knows if THEY ignore the signs they will be guaranteed to be the ONLY one shooting until law enforcement can be called and eventually enter the building.\nSee now here’s two possible outcomes at different places.\nSchool (gun free zone). Someone sees a shooter carrying a rifle through the parking lot and up to the front door. EVERYONE panics because there is no one to stop the shooter so the shooter is allowed to enter the school unchallenged. Someone manages to call the police and 20+ minutes later they show up.\nRestaurant (one that welcome’s CHL holders). Guy with a rifle walks through the door. INSTANTLY the patrons that have a chl spring into action. They draw their legally concealed weapons and the shooter dies where he stood in the door. He doesnt even get off a shot.\nCHL holders protect others like the Secret service and armed security protect the president and government officials. There is an INSTANT response to a threat and often the shooter doesnt get off a shot.\nConvenient for the shooter that the ONLY place that doesnt happen are “gun free zones”. possibly because the law abiding citizens are SO good at reading signs and the criminals simply ignore them (they KNOW that the law abiding will be following the laws to the letter…even if it means disarming)",

      "23": "As tempted as I am to make a johnny can’t read joke gun free zones are simply feel good measure.\nThe initial reasoning for them was sound. They didn’t want guns on school grounds and expected (correctly) that law abiding gun owners wouldn’t bring their weapons to school. This was to prevent accidents, and of course to prevent a fast kid from grabbing the weapon. This does happen, in my town last year a school resource police officer had his gun grabbed. Kids who want to cause mischief are geniuses at distraction.\nBut now both sides of the gun debate use gun free zones as cases in point. Liberal teachers brag that they are much safer without guns and conservative pundits tease and have FB memes about naughty shooters who didn’t read the sign. Anti gun advocates have seized on gun free zones as a way to keep everyone safe in many cases ignoring the logic that a psycho doesn’t care about a sign, and a conscientious gun owner wouldn’t bring a gun to a school anyway. Pro gun people find the absurdity of a sign stopping a maniac and ignoring the initial reasoning for the signs.",
      "24": "They carry them on. The trouble is, most people are law abiding and don’t carry guns in Gun Free Zones. That makes them unarmed targets of people who want to do violence to them. Gun Free Zones are nothing more than invitations to very bad people to come and do very bad things. They are legitimate killing fields. They should be done away with. I do not go into gun free zones at all. I stay out of clinics, hospitals, indoor malls, anywhere guns are prohibited because they are very dangerous areas. This has been proven too many times.\nHere’s a little scenario for you. You take your family to a Saturday movie at a movie theater where guns are prohibited but you conceal it and legally carry your gun in. Some leftist nut decides to shoot the place up and kills a couple of people before you can take him out with your gun. The police come and they arrest you for carrying a gun in the theater even though you saved a lot of lives. You are now the criminal because you took out a would be leftist mass murderer. Under the Constitution, you had every legal right to carry, but the crooked leftist state unconstitutional laws and the crooked leftist movie theater says you do not. Who is right here? In reality, your only real option here is to let the leftist mass murderer kill as many people as he or she wants to including you because in leftist America you have no right to self defense. That is what America is coming to. The left will stop at nothing to disarm America so they can take total control of us just like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Maduro and every other despot have done through the ages.

      "25": "Here is an example of a typical gun free zone sign, like everything you can buy one on Amazon.\nLet's say someone sneaks up on my porch in the middle of the night and tapes this sign to my door. Do the guns in my house suddenly vanish? No of course that's completely ridiculous right? It just as ridiculous as the idea that posting this sign anywhere else keeps guns out. See the thing is, guns can't read so the the gun has to be carried into the so called “gun free zone” by a person. The person simply walks past the sign just like they would if it weren't there. It's not that complicated.",

      "29": "There are good arguments in support of guns, and those that are just silly.\nSaying something like ““gun free zones don’t work because criminals don’t obey the law” is one of them.\nIn general, most people think that a harsher penalty deters crime. If we made murder a misdemeanor, there would be more murders.\nSo people have to make some logical choices. If your argument is ““criminals don’t obey the law, so having prisons and penalties is unnecessary, because it won’t stop crime”, then the argument against schools being gun free zones makes tons of sense.\nBut my experience is that people who want guns in schools usually also believe that laws with penalties do deter crimes.\nAnd that’s why they have gun free zones. It allows the imposition of harsher penalties for anyone committing a crime on school grounds, who is carrying a firearm\nI think it’s perfectly okay to try to argue that schools are either safer with lots of guns, or as gun free. That’s an issue which can be decided by observing empirical evidence.\nBut to argue that we should get rid of legal penalties because ““they don’t stop crime because criminals don’t obey the law” is just asking not to be taken seriously.",

That should work.\nOn second thought, I’ll just keep my farm dogs on patrol.\nThen I thought, if I get back into SCUBA diving, I should bring some waterproof “Shark Free Zone” signs along with me, just for added protection.\nBut then I thought, maybe I should just pay attention to water clarity, currents and bottom contour, game fish activity…\nI could put up some “Tornado Free Zone” signs around my house… but it might be more practical to store water and supplies in my basement.",
      "31": "They carried them on.\nThe point of a gfz is to identify the armed people who are not allowed to have a gun… if anyone could carry, then a shooter can better blend in and innocents with guns more likely to be shot.",
      "32": "I think sometimes they just don’t see the signs that say “gun free zone”.\nSurely if they saw the sign, they would have turned around and taken their gun somewhere else, and shoot up a place where guns are allowed. Clearly.\nSo problem here is: the sign must not have been big enough. Or perhaps it was posted in an area where a person is unlikely to see it?\nBigger “Gun free zone” signs will probably fix this problem. Maybe use one of those orange neon colored backgrounds? Just to add visibility.",
      "33": "There are a lot of stupid people in the world. In the USA we put them in charge of things like school safety. In many cases about the only thing that makes a school or other location gun free is the sign, pretty clever. We should try similar signs. Perhaps a robbery free zone sign at banks, or a drug free zone sign at the Mexico/US border. How about a death free zone on highways. See problem solved. Amazing what a sign can do.\nNow in courts and other places where they are serious there are armed guards or police using metal detectors and other devices to prevent someone coming in with a gun undetected.",

      "37": "Not only do they just walk in uncontested, it is pretty much an invitation and open season on schools and all other “gun free zones”. The last thing a mass murderer wants is to come across an armed individual who could stop them from killing as many people as possible before cowardly turning their gun on themselves. These are called “soft targets”. When have you seen a mass shooting in a police station? (They have been attempted but are stopped pretty damn quickly…why? Because the buildings are full of people with guns!) These are hard targets. Either deal with the mental illness and its’ causes to deal with the shooters before they become shooters, or harden potential targets. No other suggested “solutions” will do a damn thing.",

      "40": "Simple, the same reason all gun control laws don't reduce crime.\nCriminals are willing to violate laws up to and including the death penalty, do you think a gun control law makes them worry at all? A gun free zone actually let's the shooter know everyone there is not armed. You don't see mass shooters attacking police stations, because they know everyone there is armed, and they will shot back!\nNone of the ‘gun free' zone laws can be enforced until after they are violated. By then, it is too late, with many innocent dead.",
      "41": "Do people actually obey speed limit signs?\nNo\nIn fact, people get mad at the “slowpoke” who DOES drive at the speed limit.\nGun Free Zone signs are just as effective as speed limit signs.\nThey are essentially a waste of materials and manpower.",

As soon as someone sees it, they can call the cops to report it, and the cops will respond.\nThat takes time.\nTo most of us, it really doesn't matter that it takes them time to arrive. Once they do, we can expect fines, jail time, and that big shiny scarlet F for Felon to follow us elsewhere. That's enough to deter regular folks from doing it.\nBut to the school shooter, none of this matters, because they plan not to survive. They have until the police arrive to do what they came to do, and then it's suicide by cop.\nAnd that is why stopping these spree shooters is so difficult. Doing so ahead of time requires a Pre-Crime division, doing so in the moment requires response times that only an armed victim can provide, and making the consequences suicidal doesn't inhibit the already suicidal or “murderously-suicidal\" at all.",

All the time.\nNotice a trend here?\nA “gun-free zone” is nothing more than a piece of plastic hanging on a wall. It only works if the people entering the area respect the rules of the people who are in charge of the area.\nA mass shooter doesn’t respect anybody’s rules any more. They are willing to break the biggest baseline taboo in every human psyche: wanton taking off human life. Do you really think that a sign that says “Gun-Free Zone” would mean anything to such a person?",
      "44": "So called “gun free zones\" just make innocent people into sitting ducks. The reason evil people target such places is because they know they won't be shot. The most dangerous places are gun free zones.",
      "45": "Get real. That is like asking how people exceed the speed limit when there are signs stating the speed limit.\nGun free zones only designate where it is illegal to carry guns. You cross the line with a gun , you can be arrested. You don’t need to show it to anyone, use it, or make a threat. The simple fact that you are within the zone is sufficient for arreest.\nOf course, if there is no one around to arrest you, as there is not always someone around to catch speeders, you can do whatever you want.\nLaws do not stop crimes, they only identify what is a crime and proscribe the punishment. It is your decision to be or not to be a law breaker.",

A sign.\nNeither will create the necessary barrier to stop a gun from entering such an area.\nWhat a “Gun Free Zone” sign tells a prospective shooter is that they are facing a target rich environment with minimal resistance.\nIn other words, lots of people to shoot until police arrive.\nNow think about this. In the vast majority of school shootings, the gun(s) used were obtained illegally. (Stolen, Straw Purchase etc.) So they broke the law to avoid one gun control measure. Then they entered a gun free zone. (Another Gun Control Measure). They will often times conceal their weapons.\nEric Harris an...",
      "50": "You are kidding of course, aren’t you?\nThat “No Guns Allowed” sign has NO ability to stop or deter an armed person.

    "answers": {
      "1": "If I were to reboot Bleach, I would definitely change a few things…\nSubstitute Soul Reaper Arc\nHigh school student Ichigo Kurosaki lives with his father Isshin and twin younger sisters Karin and Yuzu, attending Kurakara High alongside his friends Sado “Chad” Yasutora, dojo heir Tatsuki Asawari, and Tatsuki’s best friend Orihime Inoe. What sets Ichigo apart is that he’s able to see ghosts.\nWhile on his way home from school, Ichigo picks a fight with some delinquents who knocked over a memorial to a kid who died in a car accident. Ichigo is abruptly attacked by a monster, but is saved by a young woman in samurai garb. The woman’s shock that Ichigo can see her — and his resemblance to someone called Kaien — enables the monster to escape, and Ichigo flees home in shock.\nThe woman follows him and introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper from the Soul Society. Rukia explains that the monster is a Hollow, a dark spirit born when a human soul is consumed by spiritual corruption, preying on other spirits and humans with supernatural powers, and it is the duty of Soul Reapers dispatched to the World of the Living to slay Hollows and escort ghosts to the afterlife of Soul Society. The Hollow attacks and Ichigo realizes he led it right to his family, rushing out to fight it despite Rukia’s attempts to restrain him with magic.\nRukia tackles Ichigo out of the way of the Hollow’s attack and is badly wounded by it, forcing her to perform the Konsho ritual, which will temporarily imbue Ichigo with Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo’s soul is ejected from his body wearing a Soul Reaper Shihakushō and wielding a katana as large as he is tall. Taking the Hollow by surprise, Ichigo slays it before being knocked out by Kisuke Urahara, who tells Rukia she’ll be in a lot of trouble if Soul Society finds out what she did.\nIchigo wakes up believing the events of the night before to have been a dream until he sees the damage the Hollow inflicted, Yuzu and Karin telling him a truck crashed into their house in the middle of the night. Ichigo goes to school and is shocked to see Rukia arrive disguised as a transfer student.\nPulling Ichigo aside, Rukia explains that she only intended to temporarily give him a portion of her powers but that something has happened to drain her dry, forcing her to use an artificial body, and that Ichigo will be forced to hunt Hollows in her stead until her powers return. Ichigo bluntly refuses until Rukia guilt-trips him but leading him to where the ghost of a child is being attacked by a Hollow. Ichigo agrees to fight and Rukia introduces him to Urahara, who runs a Hollow-slaying bounty hunting business out of his candy store.\nOver the end of spring and into summer break, Ichigo hunts Hollows and learns the basics of being a Soul Reaper from Rukia and Urahara, while Chad, Orihime, and Tatsuki awaken powers of their own:\nWhile protecting Ichigo’s sisters from a Hollowfied serial child murderer, Chad develops the Fullbring power to cover his right arm in a Hollow-like exoskeleton inspired by his love of tokusatsu superheroes.\nOrihime is attacked by Acidwire — the Hollowfied spirit of her older brother Sora, and Tatsuki is mortally wounded trying to protect her. Orihime’s stubborn refusal to let her friend die awakens a potent Fullbring channeled through her hairclips, granting her the ability to resurrect Tatsuki before passing out from the strain of channeling this power, and Acidwire struggles to resist the urge to eat her long enough for Tatsuki to awaken and break his mask with a punch. Transforming into an Arrancar, Acidwire flees to the Hollow Realm, and Urahara retrieves them.\nAs Orihime recovers, Urahara explains that some humans with spiritual powers are able to awaken unique powers called Fullbring, and that Orihime’s Fullbring is related to a myth about the Soul King — an omnipotent deity said to have created the World of the Living and the Spirit Worlds. According to the myth, the Soul King granted his three sons the the power to change the past, the power to change the present, and the power to change the future; powers said to recur in their reincarnations.\nIchigo finds out that his mother, who died when he was just a child, was killed by a Hollow called Grand Fisher. Ichigo fights Grand Fisher and wins, but is badly wounded. While Ichigo recovers, Rukia tells him about Kaien Shiba, the Captain of Squad 13 and heir to the noble Shiba Clan, who she’d had a crush on. While investigating the disappearance of Souls from the rural districts surrounding the city of Seireitei, Kaien and his squad had come across a hidden laboratory where illegal experiments on Hollows and Hollowfication were being conducted by a traitor within Soul Society. The lab was self-destructed by the traitor running the experiments, but Kaien had been infected by Hollow essence and transformed into a Hollow/Soul Reaper hybrid — forcing Rukia to cut him down. Isshin, eavesdropping in the next room, is chastised by Urahara for not telling Ichigo the truth and warned that things could go badly if he waits too long, but says he isn’t ready yet. Ichigo deduces that Rukia believes he is Kaien’s reincarnation due to their uncanny resemblance, and wonders if their friendship is only based on that.\nAs summer progresses, Rukia grows increasingly concerned that her powers aren’t returning and the deadline for her to return to Soul Society passes. Uryū Ishida, a classmate of Ichigo’s who had secretly been following him, attacks him and reveals himself as a Quincy. When neither Ichigo or Rukia react, Uryū begrudgingly explains that his people were a faction of humans with spiritual powers akin to Fullbring who believed that all Hollows should be exterminated, leading to them being all-but wiped out in a war with Soul Society. To prove Quincies superior to Soul Reapers, Uryū challenges Ichigo and his friends to a Hollow-slaying contest, using bait to attract a massive horde of Hollows.\nWith Orihime acting as the team medic and Rukia as mission control, Ichigo’s team pulls ahead but Uryū refuses to admit defeat, blaming Soul Reapers for the murder of his mother and grandfather. Uryū tries to shoot Rukia with a super-charged Holy Arrow, but Ichigo takes the blow. Unconscious, he has a vision of a grim middle-aged man in a black cloak, who tells him he isn’t ready yet. Ichigo asks what the man’s name is, but his reply is blotted out.\nIchigo awakens to find Orihime healing him while Chad restrains Tatsuki from beating Uryū to a pulp. Just as Orihime faints from overusing her powers, a massive Hollow that a horrified Rukia identifies as a Gillian-class Menos rips through the sky. Rukia explains that Menos are the product of Hollows cannibalizing each other and almost never leave the Spirit Worlds — and when they do leave nothing but death and destruction in their wake. Despite being outmatched, Ichigo and Uryū team up to fight the Gillian before it can fully emerge, Ichigo straining his powers to their limit blocking its Cero energy beam with his sword before instinctively returning fire with a blast of energy, wounding it enough to cause it to retreat.\nDetecting the Gillian’s breach, Soul Society tracks down Rukia and dispatches Squad 6 Captain Byakuya Kuchiki (her adoptive brother and head of the noble Kuchiki Clan) and Squad 6 Lieutenant Renji Abarai to execute the human she gave her powers to and arrest her to face judgment. As Rukia — not wanting to endanger Ichigo — leaves to turn herself over in exchange for Ichigo being spared, Ichigo awakens and goes after her. Ichigo challenges Renji and Byakuya to a duel, catching Renji off-guard and gaining the upper hand until Renji releases his Shikai. Ichigo refuses to back down and starts gaining the upper hand by identifying weaknesses in Renji’s fighting style. Byakuya — annoyed by Ichigo’s resemblance to Kaien Shiba — easily overpowers and prepares to kill him, but Rukia begs them to stop and demands Ichigo return her stolen powers to her, walking him through the ritual she’d used to give him her powers. Ichigo is rendered a powerless human but refuses to let them arrest Rukia, and promptly cut down by Byakuya.\nIchigo awakens at Urahara’s store being healed by Orihime, and is told that Urahara’s contact in Soul Society has informed him that Rukia has been placed on trial for high treason. Revealing himself as an exiled Soul Reaper and former Captain of Squad 12, Urahara begins working on a portal to Soul Society and introduces Ichigo and his allies to Yoruichi Shihōin, another exiled Soul Reaper and ex-Captain of Squad 2. Not knowing when he’ll return, Ichigo tells his family that he’s going on a road trip with some friends, and Isshin bestows him with Masaki’s Quincy Cross — which he says is a good luck pendant.\nIchigo asks what happened to the giant katana he had previously and is told he had “borrowed” Rukia’s Zanpakutō, but that the time has come for him to unleash his own Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo is confused by this and is told that Rukia’s infusion of power acted as a catalyst for Ichigo’s own powers, abruptly realizing that one of his parents was a Soul Reaper in disguise. Urahara refuses to elaborate and begins drilling Ichigo in Zanjutsu while Ishida solo trains and Yoruichi trains Chad, Tatsuki, and Orihime to further improve their Fullbrings.\nMeditating, Ichigo again meets the grouchy old man and surmises he must be his Zanpakutō Spirit. The Old Man doesn’t refute this, and begrudgingly helps Ichigo draw on his training with Rukia to awaken his Zanpakutō, Zangetsu… or so Ichigo believes, though his new weapon is actually the Quincy Cross transformed into a sword. Chad becomes able to armour both arms, Tatsuki becomes able to charge fireballs of spiritual energy, and Orihime becomes able to manifest a shield ostensibly capable of blocking any attack. Once the portal is complete, Ichigo and his allies — guided by Yoruichi — set out for Soul Society and arrive in the Rukongai, a feudal Japanese village surrounding the city of Seireitei and populated by the Souls of Japanese people sent to the afterlife.\nSoul Society Arc\nIn the Seireitei, the order to execute Rukia comes as a shock to Renji and her superior, Squad 13 Captain Jūshirō Ukitake. Sworn to uphold the law, Byakuya is seemingly indifferent to his sister’s fate. With Rukia being the sole surviving witness of the Hollowfication laboratory, a rumour begins circulating of a conspiracy and traitors in Soul Society’s midst. Suspicion falls on Squad 12 Captain Mayuri Kurotsuchi, a notorious mad scientist once imprisoned for his grotesque experiments, and Squad 3 Captain Gin Ichimaru. When a group of intruders arrive from the World of the Living and break into the Seireitei, Squad 5 Captain Sōsuke Aizen is found brutally murdered after claiming to have uncovered the conspiracy’s mastemind and their connection to the intruders. Perturbed by the notion of traitors in Soul Society, Squad 1 Captain Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto issues the order for the intruders to be captured and put to death, and the matter of Aizen’s murder to be investigated once Rukia has been executed.\nIchigo’s group crash with Kūkaku Shiba, Kaien’s younger sister — who inherited the leadership of the clan after his death and their uncle’s mysterious disappearance say them stripped of noble status. Kūkaku helps Ichigo and his friends break into the Seireitei but they’re separated.\nUryū fights Mayuri and learns he performed horrific experiments on the souls of deceased Quincies — including Uryū‘s mother and grandfather — and overclocks his powers to deal a would-be fatal blow to the mad scientist, forcing him to retreat while the shinobi of Squad 2 capture the incapacitated Uryū.\nOrihime and Tatsuki disguise themselves as Soul Reapers; Tatsuki managing to befriend some members of the boisterous and battle-hungry Squad 11 while Orihime — not wanting to fight — sets up shop in the Squad 4 barracks and helps heal the wounded until she’s found out by Captain Retsu Unohana.\nChad and Tatsuki — once found out — punch their way through the rank and file Soul Reapers before being defeated by Squad 8 Captain Shunsui Kyōraku and Squad 9 Captain Kaname Tōsen, the former stopping the latter from summarily executing them on the pretence of having them interrogated first.\nIchigo fights Squad 11 3rd Seat Ikkaku Madarame and 4th Seat Yumichika Ayasegawa, who warn Ichigo about Squad 11’s bloodthirsty Captain Kenpachi Zaraki. Ichigo then has a rematch with Renji and defeats him. Renji determines that Ichigo and his friends aren’t responsible for Aizen’s assasination and only want to rescue Rukia, telling him his friends have all been arrested and warning him that Byakuya would gladly kill Rukia himself to uphold Soul Society’s laws. Byakuya finds Renji and is stopped from summarily executing him for losing to Ichigo, disregarding Renji telling him that Ichigo is getting stronger and having him placed under arrest.\nWhen Rukia’s execution is moved up, Ukitake and Kyōraku deduce that the intruders are a distraction and the mastermind’s real target is Rukia. Ichigo runs into Zaraki and fights him, subconsciously using Blut Vene and Blut Arterie to defeat him after asking the Old Man to lend him Zangetsu’s power. Carrying him to safely, Squad 11 Lieutenant Yachiru Kusajishi grumps that Ken-chan could have won if he let her help and is a big dummy for not doing so. When a wounded and exhausted Ichigo arrives at Rukia’s prison, Byakuya foils his attempt to jailbreak her before being distracted by Ukitake, enabling Yoruichi to escape with Ichigo.\nSquad 10 Captain Toshirō Hitstugaya accuses Gin of murdering Aizen, though his childhood friend and Squad 5 lieutenant Momo Hinamori — who had been in love with Aizen — reveals Aizen’s letter named Hitsugaya as the mastermind and attacks him in a blind rage. The other Captains break up the fight, placing Momo under arrest. Having befriended and being completely unintimidated by Unohana, Orihime — still incognito as a Squad 4 Soul Reaper — bluffs her way into the prison and heals her friends, Ikkaku, Yumichika, Renji, Momo, and the also-arrested Zaraki. Wanting a rematch with Ichigo, Zaraki makes Tatsuki an honorary Squad 11 member and stages a jailbreak, more to test his might against the other Captains than anything else.\nTaking refuge in one of Urahara’s hideouts from before their exile, Yoruichi decides to train Ichigo to use Bankai since that’s the only way he’ll survive fighting Byakuya. With Ichigo being totally clueless, a newly arrived Renji explains that he should already know that trainee Soul Reapers are issued a supernatural katana called an Asauchi and imprint their souls on it to transform it into their personal Zanpakutō, which possess an activated state called a Shikai. Renji exposits that with intense training Soul Reapers can commune with their Zanpakutō Spirit — the embodiment of their powers — and attain an even greater state called Bankai. Having mostly finished his training, Renji departs to train on his own. However, Ichigo makes no progress due to not having an actual Zanpakutō, leaving him frustrated and confused.\nRukia’s execution is moved forward again and Ichigo’s training is cut short when Squad 2 Captain Suì-Fēng — who had been Yoruichi’s personal bodyguard and protégée before her exile — attacks seeking to kill her former mentor. Yoruichi fights Suì-Fēng to buy Ichigo time to escape, but while Suì-Fēng gains the upper hand she lets slip that she had been heartbroken when Yoruichi had fled Soul Society alongside Urahara without her. Deciding to stop holding back, Yoruichi releases her Zanpakutō and defeats Suì-Fēng, who confesses she had fallen in love with Yoruichi but been too afraid of rejection and jealous of her friendship with Urahara to confess at the time.\nDeciding to rescue Rukia himself, Renji fights Byakuya using his new Bankai but is ultimately overpowered and left for dead. Zaraki fights Tōsen and Squad 7 Captain Sajin Komamura, unmasking the latter as a humanoid wolf from the Beast Realm, and forces them to retreat when he overpowers their Bankai. Ukitake and Kyōraku recruit Hitsugaya and send him to investigate the Central 46 — Soul Society’s governing body — while they interrupt Rukia’s execution. Momo follows Hitsugaya and they find the Central 46 have been dead for days, Momo irrationally assuming that Hitsugaya did it and attacking him. Their fight is interrupted by a very much alive Aizen, who badly wounds them before Unohana intervenes. Not wanting to fight her, Aizen retreats.\nRecalling that before his exile Urahara had created an artefact called the Hōgyoku, which possessed divine power on par with the Soul King’s and could transform the souls of others, Ukitake and Kyōraku put together the clues and realize that Urahara had implanted the Hōgyoku into the artificial body he had given Rukia — which had been rigged to drain her powers and transform her into a living, powerless human — in the hopes of destroying it. Realized that the dormant Hōgyoku — the real target of the conspiracy — is still inside Rukia, they set out to stall her execution long enough for Ichigo to rescue her, fighting Yamamoto while Ichigo flees with Rukia.\nByakuya pursues Ichigo and unleashes his Bankai, effortlessly overpowering Ichigo’s fake Shikai. Ichigo crashlands in the ruins of the old Hollowfication laboratory, but refuses to give up. Byakuya cuts Ichigo down — spilling a vat of Hollow essence onto his body — and prepares to kill Rukia himself only to be attacked by a Hollowfied Ichigo. Frozen in horror, Rukia can only watch as history repeats and Hollow Ichigo brutally maims her brother. As Hollow Ichigo stands poised to kill Byakuya with a supercharged Cero, Rukia throws herself between them… and Orihime blocks the blast. Her Fullbring powers resonate with the Hōgyoku inside Rukia and activates it, stabilizing Ichigo’s Hollowfication and enabling his consciousness to wrest control of his body back from his new Inner Hollow, reversing his transformation. Unohana notifies everyone of Aizen’s deceptions and a ceasefire is called. An investigation uncovers a recording of Aizen gloating that he was behind everything — having conducted illegal Hollowfication experiments and created the first Hōgyoku over a century ago as part of a bid to usurp the Soul King. When Urahara had created a second Hōgyoku, Aizen had framed Urahara for the Hollowfication of several high-ranking Soul Reapers in a bid to steal it, only for Urahara to escape with it into the World of the Living. Overthrowing the god-king of the Hollow Realm, Aizen had continued the Hollowfication experiments — including the ones that had resulted in Kaien’s death — and amassed an army of Adjuchas and even a few Vasto Lorde Menos. When Rukia had flushed Urahara out of hiding, Aizen had killed the Central 46 and ordered her execution to obtain the second Hōgyoku — which he intends to merge with his Hōgyoku and use to usurp the Soul King. Everyone reconvenes in the Seireitei and the Captains begin to hunt for Aizen. Orihime heals Byakuya, who asks Rukia why she would sacrifice herself to save him when he was trying to kill her; and she says that he was following orders and is still her brother. Byakuya reveals that he had married Rukia’s older sister against his family’s wishes, and after her untimely death had adopted Rukia into the Kuchiki Clan per his wife’s deathbed request; promising his unamused family that he would strictly abide by to the laws of Soul Society and rules of their station as nobles. In trying to kill Rukia he had broken his promise to his wife, making him triply unworthy of her admiration and forgiveness, but Rukia forgives him anyway. Orihime uses her powers to extract the Hōgyoku from Rukia, but before she can destroy it Aizen reveals himself and steals it. Gin and Tōsen reveal themselves as Aizen’s accomplices, summoning a horde of Menos-class Hollows to rampage while they escape to the Hollow Realm.\nIchigo and his friends help vanquish the Hollows and are (begrudgingly) issued full pardons by Yamamoto, as are Urahara, Yoruichi, and Rukia. Ichigo and his friends elect to return to the World of the Living and are given passes letting them come and go from Soul Society as they please. Ichigo is given an Asauchi of his own by Ukitake, as well as a badge designating him a Substitute Soul Reaper. Rukia decides to remain in Soul Society, but promises to return to the World of the Living once she’s fully recovered.\nArrancar Arc\nA year and a half passes with no news from Soul Society. Rukia’s replacement is an incompetent idiot who picks a fight with Ichigo every time they run into each other and runs away screaming from all but the weakest of Hollows. Ichigo’s sisters begin developing powers of their own but tell him (with varying levels of politeness) to mind his own business, while Isshin plays dumb.\nYoruichi moves back to Soul Society but Urahara stays in the World of the Living. Seeing Uryū’s father react to seeing his mother’s pendant, Ichigo realizes it’s Quincy-related and tries to press him for answers but is told at arrow-point to leave the Ishida family alone.\nIchigo imprints on his Asauchi, but trying to use his new Zanpakutō puts him at risk of Hollowfication and he finds himself plagued by nightmares of the Old Man and his Inner Hollow fighting. Learning that Quincy weapons results in the vanquished Hollows being completely destroyed, Ichigo becomes depressed at having unwittingly done so to the Hollows he slew and increasingly reluctant to fight at all.\nAt the Ishida household, Ryūken puts Ishida through a brutal training regimen to reawaken his powers while making him swear to cut off all contact with Soul Reapers, especially Ichigo Kurosaki.\nTatsuki and Chad train together to hone their Fullbrings, leading to rumours that they are dating, though they both deny this. Orihime thinks they would make a cute couple, but beneath her blithe exterior is depressed that for all her godlike potential to warp reality she can’t help Ichigo.\nFinally, after seventeen months, Aizen issues his declaration of war. Vasto Lorde-class Arrancar & Espada #4 Ulquiorra Cifer and Adjucha-class Arrancar & Espada #10 Yammy Riyalgo are dispatched to assess if Ichigo and his friends will pose a threat to Aizen’s plans. While Yammy wreaks havoc in Karakura Town, Ulquiorra dismisses the chance of mere humans posing a threat to them as less than zero. Chad and Tatsuki interrupt Yammy’s feeding frenzy and manage to get a few good blows in, Ulquiorra dismissing them as trash when Yammy gets mad and overpowers them. Ichigo arrives and cuts off one of Yammy’s arms, but starts losing control of his Hollow powers; piquing Ulquiorra’s interesting as his power levels fluctuate from lower than Yammy’s to dwarfing his own. Ulquiorra deems Ichigo a potential threat to be eliminated, but his Cero is blocked by Orihime. Noting her powers, Ulquiorra takes Yammy and returns to the Hollow Realm.\nThe next day, Toshirō Hitsugaya and Rangiku Matsumoto of Squad 10, Renji Abarai of Squad 6, Ikkaku Madarame and Yumichika Ayasegawa of Squad 11, and Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13 are dispatched to the World of the Living. Ever the drill sergeant, Rukia drags Ichigo away to hunt Hollows and gives him a harsh pep talk that restores his resolve, revealing that her powers have returned in full — letting her fight by Ichigo’s side instead of relying on him for protection. Seeing Ichigo’s resolve restored, Orihime laments to Tatsuki that she doesn’t stand a chance against Rukia when it comes to winning his heart, Tatsuki stating she knows how that feels but advising Orihime to not lose hope that the object of her affection will notice how she feels and reciprocate.\nOver the next several days, the Soul Reapers patrol Karakura Town, enjoying the mortal world despite Hitsugaya admonishing them to focus on their mission, and sparring with Ichigo’s crew. Grand Fisher — transformed into an Arrancar — attacks Ichigo looking for revenge, but is cut down by Ichigo and Isshin — revealing himself as a Captain-class Soul Reaper — together, avenging Masaki. Acidwire approaches Orihime and complements her powers — manifesting her love for and desire to protect her friends — and lets himself be cut down by her using Rukia’s Zanpakutō, cleansing him and sending him to Soul Society.\nGoing against Aizen’s orders, Adjuchas-class Arrancar & Espada #6 Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez leads his Fracciónes on an attack on the Soul Reapers that results in his subordinates being slain. Despite being frozen by Rukia’s ice-based Shikai, Grimmjow furiously breaks free and blasts her with a point-blank Cero, an enraged Ichigo returning the favour with a crimson Getsuga Tenshō that scars Grimmjow’s chest. With Ichigo on the brink of Hollowfying, Grimmjow prepares to unleash his Resurrección only to be recalled to Hueco Mundo by Tōsen. Tōsen lops off one of Grimmjow‘s arms as punishment and he is stripped of his rank by Aizen, being replaced by the squid-like Arrancar Luppi Antenor.\nSparring with Ichigo to improve her Zanjutsu and work towards attaining her Bankai, Rukia suggests Ichigo use his Zanpakutō and Quincy sword together in a dual-wielding style similar to Ukitake and Kyōraku‘s. During one of their sessions, Ichigo is approached by Shinji Hirako and Hiyori Sarugaki, the latter of whom tries to pick a fight by insinuating that Rukia is cheating on Ichigo with Renji, only to fly into a rage when Ichigo calls her a kid. Shinji stops Hiyori from attacking and offers to help Ichigo master his Hollow powers, revealing he can summon a Hollow mask at will. Ichigo goes to train with the Visored, prompting a nasty argument between him and Rukia, who tells him the Visored are a gang of Soul Reaper criminals who illegally gave themselves Hollow powers.\nVisiting the Visored hideout, Ichigo is introduced to the various members before being attacked by a mask-clad Hiyori intent on paying him back for calling her a kid. When Hiyori insults his mother, Ichigo snaps, Hollowfies, and almost kills her before being subdued by the other Visored. Ichigo is told that each of them faced their Inner Hollow in a mental battle and overcame it, letting them manifest a Hollow mask to boost their powers, and is warned that losing the fight will lead to him completely transforming and being reduced to a rampaging über-Hollow. Plunged into his mental world, Ichigo fights his Inner Hollow, who mocks and berates him for lacking bloodlust and combat instinct, and for letting his fear of strong opponents cripple his drive to fight instead of relishing the thrill of it. Ichigo almost loses — his body almost completely transforming into a Hollow — but recalls the memories of those he cares about and regains his resolve. Defeated, the Inner Hollow is begrudgingly impressed and acquiesces to loan Ichigo its power but warns him it will turn on him at the slightest hint of weakness. Ichigo returns to his Soul Reaper form, now able to summon his Hollow mask at will, albeit only for a brief period of time.\nDeciding to take Orihime hostage to bait Ichigo and his allies into a trap that will weaken Soul Society, Aizen sends Luppi, Grimmjow, and Yammy to create a distraction while Ulquiorra abducts Orihime. While the Soul Reapers battle Luppi, Urahara, Tatsuki, and Chad take on Yammy and pay him back for having nearly killed them. Ichigo fights Grimmjow, who mocks his inability to use Bankai. Ichigo masks up and turns the tables on Grimmjow, the mask augmenting his Zanpakutō’s Getsuga Tenshō energy blasts and turning them red — which Grimmjow compares to a Hollow’s Ceroes, to Ichigo’s annoyance — but preventing him from conjuring his Quincy sword. When the mask’s time limit runs out, Ichigo still manages to hold his own by wielding both swords — the Quincy sword to block and parry, the Zanpakutō to attack. Frustrated, Grimmjow calls an end to their match and mocks Ichigo for not realizing he was a diversion as he returns to the Hollow Realm.\nAcross the city, Orihime agrees to go to the Hollow Realm with Ulquiorra if he spares a sleeping Tatsuki, and threatens to erase him from existence if he harms her, confusing and amusing the nihilistic Arrancar. Given a moment to say goodbye, Orihime has an epiphany regarding Tatsuki’s earlier advice and writes a coded letter explaining her actions — intending to use her Fullbring to destroy the Hōgyoku. Upon arriving in the fortress of Las Noches, Orihime is ordered to heal Grimmjow as a test of her powers, Grimmjow promptly eating Luppi alive. She then watches as Aizen uses the Hōgyoku to create an Arrancar he call Wonderweiss.\nUpon learning that Orihime has been captured from a distraught Tatsuki, Ichigo demands that Soul Society rescue her, though Yamamoto instead has her branded a traitor and recalls the Soul Reapers to prepare for Aizen’s inevitable attack on Soul Society. Urahara modifies his interdimensional gateway to emulate a Hollow’s portals and sends Ichigo and his friends — including Uryū, who had regained his powers and exploited a loophole in his deal with his father to join them — to the Hollow Realm, though they are soon joined by Rukia and Renji, who also exploited a loophole to join them.\nEncountering the amnesiac childlike Arrancar Nel and her comrades Pesche Guatiche and Dondochakka Birstanne, Ichigo and Uryū are struck by the realization that not all Arrancar and Hollows are murderous monsters, and that they have a civilization of their own — though Rukia and Renji remind them that said civilization is founded on social Darwinist principles. Nonetheless resolved to save Orihime, Ichigo and his team fight their way through Hueco Mundo; Ichigo, Chad, and Tatsuki feeling their powers growing stronger with each battle. Reaching the fortress of Las Noches, Ichigo’s group splits up to cover more ground. Ichigo and Nel fight the former Espada Dordoni Alessandro Del Socaccio, who warns Ichigo that he will need to embrace his Hollow powers if he wants to win. Uryū fights the former Espada Cirucci Sanderwicci, but can’t bring himself to kill her due to her resemblance to a human woman despite her trying to goad him into finishing her off. Chad and Tatsuki encounter Gantenbainne Mosqueda, who challenges them to a “friendly” wrestling match that upgrades their Fullbrings, warning them about the Espada.\nRukia encounters the 9th Espada, Gillian-class Menos Aaroniero Arruruerie, who impersonates Kaien Shiba — having eaten the Hollowfied Soul Reaper, gaining all his powers and memories — in an attempt to get her to let down her guard. Letting go of her grief and self-loathing, Rukia stops holding back and cuts Aaroniero down with a Getsuga Tenshō-inspired ice-blast.\nRenji runs into the 8th Espada, the vain Adjuchas-class Arrancar Szayelaporro Granz, and forces him to retreat back to his laboratory after injuring him. Ambushing Renji and Uryū, Szayelaporro reveals his nightmarish Resurrección and prepares to torture them to death. Chad and Tatsuki run into the fanatical 7th Espada, the Adjuchas-class Arrancar Zommari Rureaux, who tries to use his Resurrección to take control of them and force them to kill each other — reminding Tatsuki too much of Numb Chandelier.\nIchigo is fatally wounded by Ulquiorra, but Grimmjow intervenes — watching a rematch — and gets Orihime to heal him. Perfecting his Hollow mask, Ichigo and Grimmjow prove evenly matched until Grimmjow finally releases his Resurrección. Activating his Bankai — which Grimmjow notes is similar to a Resurrección — Ichigo defeats Grimmjow but refuses to kill him, noting that for all his bloodlust Grimmjow isn’t wholly evil and possesses a code of honour. They are attacking by the sadistic and misogynistic Fifth Espada, the mantis-like Adjuchas-class Arrancar Nnoitra Gilga, who seemingly kills Grimmjow and mutilates Ichigo before threatening to make him watch as he tortures Orihime to death. Seeing Nnitora, Nel regains her memories as the former Third Espada, the centaur-like Vasto Lorde-class Arrancar Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck, and effortlessly trounces him to protect Ichigo. Before she can deal a finishing blow, her unstable power — the result of an attack by Nnoitra and Szayelaporro — shorts out and she abruptly reverts to child form, but refuses to escape as an enraged Nnoitra prepares to kill her and Ichigo.\nReinforcements from Soul Society arrive and turn the tide, Byakuya fighting Zommari, Mayuri fighting Szayelaporro, and Zaraki fighting Nnitora while Unohana administers medical treatment to the wounded. Orihime saves Grimmjow but is recaptured by Ulquiorra, who challenges Ichigo to prove the superiority of the bonds of friendship.\nAizen takes Gin, Tōsen, the remaining Espada, and their subordinates to attack Karakura Town. Tatsuki and Chad fight Yammy when he tries to eat Orihime, attaining the complete forms of their Fullbrings, and fall back to Karakura Town alongside the Captains to protect their friends. Ichigo duels Ulquiorra, who proves an even match for Ichigo’s Hollow mask + Bankai combo before releasing his Resurrección and easily overpowering him. When Ichigo refuses to give in, Ulquiorra’s rage causes him to go beyond Resurrección into a Bankai-like state called Segunda Etapa. Helpless, Ichigo is fatally wounded and gives in to despair at not being powerful enough. His Inner Hollow resurfaces, coldly reminding Ichigo of his earlier warning and transforming Ichigo into an über-Hollow whose raw power dwarfs even that of Ulquiorra’s Segunda Etapa form. Mortally wounding Ulquiorra, Hollow Ichigo attacks the Soul Reaper Captains — forcing even the usually composed Unohana to unsheathe her blade and Yachiru to scold an ecstatic Zaraki to fight seriously and say her name, to his confusion.\nA prisoner in his own body, Ichigo demands the Inner Hollow stop its rampage, but it mockingly reminds him he once asked to borrow its power, revealing that the über-Hollow form is Ichigo’s Resurrección and that it’s the real Zangetsu. Refusing to believe it, Ichigo frees the Old Man and fights to regain control of his body. The reactivation of Ichigo’s Quincy powers destabilizes his Hollow form, enabling Zaraki to smash Ichigo’s mask, reverting him to Soul Reaper form. Disappointed, Yachiru commiserates with Ichigo’s Zanpakutō, lamenting that Ichigo and Zaraki are both big dummies who never listen. Regaining consciousness, Yammy releases his Resurrección and is promptly bullied to death by the Soul Reaper captains while Orihime and Unohana heal everyone.\nMeanwhile, Aizen arrives to find Karakura Town has been shunted to Soul Society by Urahara and Mayuri. The Captains and Visored team up to fight the remaining Espada while Yamamoto clashes with Aizen despite his Zanpakutō being sealed by Wonderweiss. Rangiku fights Gin, demanding to know why her childhood friend betrayed her trust, but he simply mocks her for being unable to bring herself to kill him. Rangiku unleashes her Bankai and traps Gin, imprisoning him. Tōsen reveals he obtained Hollow powers and releases his Resurrección, but is defeated. Shaken by Komamura forgiving him, Tōsen reveals that the reason why he betrayed Soul Society was because he learned the truth… but is killed by Aizen before he can elaborate. After Espada #1 Coyote Starrk and Espada #2 Baraggan Louisenbairn — the former god-emperor of the Hollow Realm — are vanquished, Espada #3 Tier Harribel realizes Aizen was using them as disposable pawns and had no desire to bring peace to the Hollow Realm — the reason she had agreed to serve him as a Vasto Lorde. Aizen fatally wounds her before incapacitating Yamamoto and revealing he fused with the Hōgyoku. Urahara, Isshin, and Yoruichi arrive and fight Aizen, but are defeated as Aizen begins to apotheosize into a god.\nIchigo arrives and blasts Aizen with a point-blank Hollow mask + Bankai Getsuga Tenshō, but Aizen is unfazed and mocks Ichigo, saying that if he had arrived sooner or used a Gran Rey Cero in his Resurrección he might have won. Mocking Ichigo for still not comprehending his true power, Aizen takes Gin and leaves for the real Karakura Town.\nIn Karakura Town, Tatsuki, Chad, Karin, and Yuzu work to evacuate everyone. Aizen attacks, seeking to amuse himself by driving them to despair, killing them, and displaying their corpses for Ichigo to find, but Gin betrays him in an attempt to avenge Rangiku, Aizen having torn a piece of her Soul out to empower his Hōgyoku. Meanwhile, Ichigo despairs at Aizen’s seeming invulnerability, but a voice he assumes belongs to the Soul King tells him that the potential to transcend his limits lies within him as well and can be attained if he bonds to the other Hōgyoku — though if anything happens to disrupt the process his powers will be permanently sealed away and he may even lose his life from the backlash. With Orihime’s help, Ichigo implants Urahara’s Hōgyoku into himself, attains a transcendental form combining his Soul Reaper, Hollow, and Quincy powers, and fights Aizen. As the two of them blast each other with their strongest attacks, their Hōgyoku abruptly separate from them and merge together, the two of them seemingly losing their powers from the backlash as their incomplete apotheosis is stripped away. Cursing Squad Zero for interfering and propping up the abomination that is the Soul King, Aizen is captured.\nHealing Ichigo to the best of her abilities, Orihime tries to erase the Hōgyoku with her powers but is unable to do so, Urahara sealing it away for safekeeping. As his ability to see spirits fades away with his powers, Ichigo sadly bids Rukia farewell, though she promises they will see each other again. Put on trial in Soul Society, Aizen is cast into the deepest depths of Hell, though he vows to return and finish what he started even if it takes 20,000 years.\nFullbring Arc\nA year and a half later, Ichigo has graduated from high-school and gotten a job, but feels listless and incomplete without his powers — only going through the motions of being a contributing member of society. His friends have been avoiding him and seem to have moved on with their lives — Chad training to be a professional boxer, Tatsuki taking over the family dojō and teaching karate lessons, Orihime opening a quirky bakery, and Uryū planning to become a pediatrician. Worse, puberty seems to have kickstarted his sisters’ powers — Yuzu has “borrowed” their mother’s Quincy medallion and somehow managing to convince Ryūken Ishida to train her, while Karin has been sneaking out to the Urahara Shop and carrying what looks suspiciously like an Asauchi. Left with only his Substitute Soul Reaper badge, Ichigo vents his growing frustration on the local delinquents and Yakuza.\nWhen Isshin announces he’s leaving on a business trip, Ichigo is charged with looking after his sisters. While on his way to work, Ichigo comes across a mysterious man named Kūgo Ginjō being mugged by a punk named Moe Shishigawara. Chasing off the punk, Ichigo is leery of Kūgo but while on his way home is attacked by a katana-wielding man named Shukuro Tsukishima. Ichigo is rescued by Kūgo, who tells him that Tsukishima is an evil Fullbringer whose sword, the Book of the End, has two powers — the ability to cut through almost anything, and the ability to alter the past of anyone and anything he cuts with it. Kūgo warns Ichigo that his friends and family are in danger — a point proven when Uryū is hospitalized. With Chad, Tatsuki, and Orihime keeping secrets from him, Ichigo goes to work to find Tsukishima has taken his place there. Horrified, he returns home to find Tsukishima waiting for him there too, having inserted himself into Yuzu and Karin’s past as their beloved older brother. Now a stranger to his own siblings, Ichigo flees in horror and despair.\nIchigo seeks out Kūgo, who reveals himself to be the leader of X-Cution, a group of Fullbringer vigilantes whose membership now includes Chad, Orihime, and Tatsuki — who’ve been honing their powers in secret while searching for a way to help Ichigo regain his. Kūgo explains that X-Cution was formed by a Soul Reaper who’d sought to help the Fullbringers better defend themselves against Hollows, but that Soul Society had labelled the Soul Reaper a traitor and had him executed. Kugo explains that Fullbring works similarly to a Soul Reaper’s Zanpakutō and a Quincy’s medallion: by imprinting their soul and spiritual energy into an object close to them, they can manifest their power through it. When Ifuo asks how that could help him regain his lost Soul Reaper power, Kūgo points out that Ichigo already possesses an object to use as a focal point for his Fullbring — his Substitute Soul Reaper badge, which has been saturated in his spiritual power ever since he received it — and that if he can attain Fullbring the power he lost will seep back into his soul and break the seal formed from the backlash of using the Hōgyoku.\nWith his family compromised, Ichigo trains with X-Cution and awakens the first stage of his Fullbring with help from Riruka Dokugamine and Giriko Kutsuzawa. However, Tsukishima surreptitiously cuts all the members of X-Cution other than Kūgo with his katana, though they are seemingly unaffected. Attacklng X-Cution’s base, Tsukishima interrupts Ichigo’s training with Jackie Tristan and attempts to cut Kūgo, but Ichigo’s Fullbring progresses to its second stage — a Shihakushō-like garment comprised of black spiritual energy, with an arm-blade capable of firing weak energy blasts. Tsukishima retreats and Ichigo and Kūgo redouble their training with help from Yukio Hans Vorarlberna and manage to complete the former’s Fullbring — a black bodysuit with white armored segments and a short sword capable of firing Getusga Tenshō. While Ichigo is annoyed that he didn’t fully regain his Soul Reaper powers as promised, Kūgo assures him that the seal is cracked and it’s only a matter of training and time before his powers return not merely in full but augmented by his Fullbring. While Ichigo sets out to test his Fullbring by hunting a few Hollows, Kugō is abruptly attacked by the other members of X-Cution, who say the time has come to drop the charade. Escaping and reconvening with Ichigo, Kūgo says they’ll need to kill Tsukishima since only his death will free Ichigo’s friends and family from his control.\nSeeing his brainwashed loved ones rallying around Tsukishima and treating him like a stranger, Ichigo snaps and attacks him in a rage. Kūgo is cut taking a blow for Ichigo and seemingly fatally wounded, saying that the only way to save him is for Ichigo to transfer some of his power to him using the Konsho ritual. Just as Ichigo does so, Uryū arrives and reveals that Kūgo was the one who attacked him and has been in league with Tsukishima all along. Shocked, Ichigo sees that Kūgo is not actually injured and breaks the connection before Kūgo can fully drain his power, demanding to know what’s going on. Annoyed, Kūgo admits that he’d had Tsukishima alter his memories and those of the other X-Cution members in order to make them believe he was their enemy, all to trick Ichigo into sharing his unique blend of Soul Reaper, Hollow, and Quincy powers with them. When Ichigo demands to know why they’d do this, Kūgo reveals he has a Substitute Soul Reaper badge of his own. Kūgo states that he’d once been a seemingly normal human with the ability to see spirits, but came across a Soul Reaper badly injured by a Hollow. Out of desperation, the Soul Reaper transferred his powers to Kūgo… who slew the Hollow only to discover the Soul Reaper had died of his injuries. Taking the Soul Reaper’s Asauchi, Kūgo began slaying Hollows and slowly imprinted his own soul onto it, but was captured by Soul Reapers. Rather than execute him, Jushirō Ukitake instead deputized Kūgo as an agent of Soul Society in the mortal world, and Kugō proved exceptionally powerful — developing Captain-class spiritual power. Coming across a young Tsukishima, whose parents had been eaten by Hollows, Kūgo began gathering other Fullbringers and training them to use their powers. However, Soul Society betrayed Kūgo and sent an assassin to kill all the Fullbringers, with Tsukishima being the sole survivor. Swearing revenge, Kūgo began gathering a new generation of Fullbringers, all with the intent of tricking Ichigo into adding his immense power to Kūgo’s own so that he can take revenge on Soul Society.\nAngered and disgusted, Ichigo regenerates his Fullbring and readies himself to fight, but is beaten down by his friends and family members. Impaled from behind, he turns to see Isshin and Urahara standing behind him and is devastated by this final betrayal… only for Rukia to materialize holding a katana of raw spiritual energy that Urahara created using the Hōgyoku and charged with the spiritual power of all the allies Ichigo had made in Soul Society. The seal on Ichigo’s soul is shattered and his restored Soul Reaper powers merge with his Fullbring, layering white armour over the black Shihakushō and giving his Zanpakutō a proper hilt. A portal to Soul Society opens, Renji, Byakuya, Ikkaku, Zaraki, and Toshirō emerging and explaining that Yamamoto himself ordered Ichigo’s powers be restored to repay the debt Soul Society owed him for stopping Aizen.\nHorrified, Kūgo uses his Substitute Badge to activate his own Fullbring — letting him use his Soul Reaper powers in his physical body — and fights Ichigo one-on-one, his power greatly augmented by the piece of Ichigo’s Fullbring that he was able to steal. Urahara and Isshin knock out Ichigo’s friends and sisters, carrying them to safety, while the Soul Reapers defeat the Fullbringers — with a repentant Riruka, Jackie, Yukio, and Moe being the only survivors. Despite Kūgo using his Bankai and even Hollowfying, Ichigo proves to be exponentially stronger than he was previously and cuts him down with only his Bankai. Dying, Kūgo bitterly says he wanted revenge for the friends that Soul Society had stolen from him, a pain Ichigo should empathize with due to Tsukishima’s actions. Ichigo sadly agrees and that if things had been different he may have even sided with Kūgo, but says that Soul Society has changed for the better and that Kūgo crossed a line by harming Ichigo’s loved ones.\nWith Tsukishima dead, Ichigo’s friends and family are freed from his Fullbring’s control. While the Soul Reapers plan to take Kugō’s corpse back to Soul Society, Ichigo requests they let him bury it on Earth. Consulting with Yamamoto, the Soul Reapers reluctantly agree. Travelling to Soul Society, Ichigo meets with Ukitake, who admits that Kūgo’s story was mostly true and that he and Yamamoto had originally planned to use Ichigo to draw Kūgo out of hiding before having them both killed. While stung by this, Ichigo notes that Soul Society not going through with doing so but instead restoring his powers is proof they’ve changed for the better.",
      "2": "I’d try to find a narrative reason to introduce the elements of Bleach that often end up outside of the manga adaptation.\nOne of the reasons I think Bleach is less accessible as a story is because there is so much important lore that never seems to get the right medium to adapt. Comparing it to say Naruto for example which in a way ended up doing the exact opposite approach and ended up with a different problem because there was way too much information flooded in a very tight story, I’d try to set events like an arc with the Captains and Lieutenants who end up becoming Visoreds prior that gives them a chance to connect to the audience so that their appearance during the Karakura Town would have been more grand.\nOne might argue that the story might be taken away from Ichigo who is the main character but if we’re being honest, Bleach is more of a Gotei 13 story that it is of Ichigo and Ichigo happens to be the one who has the most events.\nI think if there is anything we learnt about the Thousand Year Blood War arc, it is that accessibility is a good thing when every element is done faithfully. The arc, though rooted in events that aren’t explored nearly enough in my opinion to make both sides feel like they are having a proper war. I don’t blame Kubo, the man was sick during a large portion of drawing the manga and the fact that he chose to push himself to finishing the arc is one of the reasons why I respect him as a writer. I think the worldbuilding of Bleach has way too many moving parts and way too many unknown elements that it might be daunting for someone to explore the world.\nHere are some of the examples of where Bleach had way too much held back. Remember Gin’s final moments? Probably one of the best moments for a lot of Bleach fans but in my opinion, having his good will be a complete mystery did more harm than good to the story. One of the reasons a character like Itachi is so integral to a lot of Naruto fans for example is the way his relationship to Sasuke was made a focal point in the story that the reveal of who he truly was changed everything. If Rangiku Matsumoto and Hitsugaya Toshiro by extension had been given a mini plot where they had to get stronger to defeat Gin personally, that would probably have changed things drastically.\nThink about the fact that this dynamic has very interesting Zanpakuto powers that together provide an interesting challenge for Gin. Hyourinmaru being an ice-type that gives Toshiro aerial mobility and Haineko turns to ash with which she can cut wherever she swings her blade. It would have made for an interesting fight, perhaps even more eventful than Harribel’s fight.\nOn regards to the main plot, the Hogyoku being simplified to be the ancient relic that was once part of the Soul King so that rather than have it be an invention of Aizen and Kisuke, instead let them instead rediscover it from the vaults of Seireitei with the power of the device being able to grant the heart’s desire being linked to the Soul King’s true desire to fulfill the wishes of his people.\nSo now, the story would go something like this; The Quincy Race has been fighting the Shinigami because of the way each side has been handling the souls but for Yamamoto and Ywhach, the fight is very different. Yamamoto is planning on using the power of the Hogyoku to destroy the Quincy people once and for all and Ywhach is insulted that the only remaining piece of his father is being used to destroy his people.\nYhwach decides to make a pact with Yamamoto to spare the remaining Quincies in exchange for having the history books acknowledge their existence as extinct. Yamamoto complies and for nearly 1000 years, nothing happens and Yamamoto and the Gotei 13 slowly resign to a more peaceful era. Yamamoto stores the Hogyoku in a safe but ultimately secure vault where it is only rediscovered by Kisuke and later Aizen. Aizen has set forth a plan that Kisuke and Gin immediately notices and while Gin joins Aizen, Kisuke refuses and splits the Hogyoku into two, maintaining the other half. Aizen uses his half to turn a significant portion of the Gotei 13 into Hollows, allowing them to be evicted so he can purposely make his future attack easier.\nAizen is able to figure out that Kisuke has placed his half onto Ichigo, with the hopes that Ichigo would always remain human and never have to use it. With Isshin being Kisuke’s ally and wanting to live a normal life, it was a given.\nNow look, Aizen is awesome but planning everything sometimes is not an interesting storytelling approach to go. I think true intelligence is found when a character is able to outsmart than being overtly omniscient. It’s good to be 4 steps ahead but 40 steps ahead is just ridiculous. So Aizen places his Hogyoku onto Rukia by trapping her in his Shikai at some point and actively created the situation where she’d be forced to activate Ichigo’s half. Most of the story from this point heads in the same direction. Aizen takes back his half and waits for Ichigo to be strong enough to challenge him.\nMany of Ichigo’s exploits in the story can now be explained as him slowly unlocking his power using the Hogyoku half that Kisuke placed on him. Aizen challenges Ichigo but slowly realizes the true difference between his usage of the Hogyoku; by being a position where he desires nothing, he can no longer evolve. But Ichigo always wants to protect his friends so he wins out. Having saved the world and now left with a desire to have things return to normal, the Hogyoku takes Ichigo’s power willfully and Ichigo begins life as a normal teen in the Fullbring arc.\nThus the Fullbring is not about Ichigo being used but about Chad and Orihime being taken advantaged of and though Ichigo is told at first that he doesn’t need to interfere, he is forced to reactivate his powers and save the two. The Fullbring antagonists threaten Karakura Town at the end of the arc and Yamamoto sends a couple of captains to help Ichigo to return the favor of Ichigo savinsg the world.\nTired of seeing his father’s soul being used as a nuclear football and the fact that the Gotei 13 very nearly cost the entire balance of souls, Yhwach breaks his pact to Yamamoto and decides to destroy the Seireitei. What’s more, Yamamoto no longer has the Hogyoku so there’s no reason to fear anything but his Bankai. The war is restarted with Ywhach hoping to finally consume his father’s entity and rule the world so he can bring the order that Yamamoto promised but couldn’t sustain.\nYamamoto’s death under Yhwach is more believeable and the second half is going to bring a revelation that nobody but Ywhach and Yamamoto knew; Squad Zero.\nI love the idea presented by these 5 characters but their justification for not saving Seireitei was pretty shabby. I think having them be a secret to Seireitei would make a lot more sense, having them be so ancient that only the oldest possible Soul Reapers would have heard of them. They would still have the same reason for not showing up till now but they’d now be a secret that Yamamoto did not feel like sharing to the Gotei 13 because he never wanted them to ever think in a battle that if they messed up, someone more powerful would come pick up their slack. They were to be self sufficient and that was always going to be the case. There were books left on their areas of expertise but nobody had heard about them for so long that they were considered myths.\nYhwach was hoping to crash the Seireitei hard enough to gain their attention because they had hidden the Soul King so well that even he hadn’t heard of them. He even trampled on Ichigo and activated his Quincy side so that when the time came to be introduced and have Ichigo be trained under them, he would find out where their hiding place was. Most of TYBW plays out the same way right up until the end.\nHe consumes his father’s entity and becomes…\nHe is now confident that now, not even Ichigo and Aizen can stop him with mere pieces of his father’s soul. But as the final fight shows, Aizen learnt his lesson. He know understands that evolution is necessary and one should never feel above it. Aizen and Ichigo make their final evolution and fight Almighty Yhwach and Yhwach is no longer able to sustain the power of his father and the Soul King takes over, consuming Yhwach and regaining his former form. The Soul King revives the Squad Zero with ease and thanks Aizen and Ichigo. Aizen tries to attack the Soul King but with a wave of his hand, he is restrained.\n“Surely, you didn’t think you could attack me with my own essence young one, did you?” Soul King says with a cheery face.\nIchigo has questions but the Soul King is clear that the answers Ichigo will get won’t satisfy him. Disappointed, the two are given one final goodbye and are instantly transported back to Seireitei, Aizen back in prison, this time his Hogyoku binding him and Ichigo right outside. The restoration to the Seireitei is instant and everyone is shocked at the power of the Soul King. The Inner Palace then disappears.\nEnd of Bleach.",
      "3": "Short answer: a lot.\nLonger answer:\n* Have Ichigo learn about his Quincy Heritage - early on in the story (perhaps as a child, or directly after the Soul Society Arc)\n* Have Yhwach be a semi mythical figure (alongside the Soul King) that is murmured about throughout the story\n* Have the battles in the Soul Society Arc, line up with later feats from these same characters. E.g. Ikkaku, Kenpachi Zaraki, Byakuya. Everyone else was otherwise portrayed as they should be\n* Explain The Final Getsuga Tenshō (Mugetsu) as a Shiba Clan ability adapted from the Quincy: Letz Stil — or something similar\n* Sprinkle hints about the true natures of White and Old Man Zangetsu — throughout the story (better than what we actually got)\n* Make Uryu more on par with Ichigo early on (instead of leaving it till the TYBW Arc)\n* Chad needs to stay a Chad\n* Explain the tragic backstory of Orihime — this would give greater understanding to why she is the way she is now\n* Make Hell more relevant in the story (like Movie 4 canonised as an arc earlier on or something)\n* Involve the other branches of Soul Society (like ...",
      "4": "Aight…. I would change this\nZaraki is one of the 5 special threats because of his combat prowess, right?\nCentral 46 also tried to stop Shunsui from teaching him Zanjutsu to make him stronger for the Quincy's 2nd invasion so the Soul Society could have an “upper hand”. They stated that if he got stronger and decided to betray the Soul Society, he would be unstoppable\nYhwach had been trying to recruit Aizen and Ichigo and put them under his command, so I think it's safe for me to say he wanted the special threats on his side\nZaraki at this point had already been stronger after surpassing Unohana and even obtained shikai which cut down a meteorite, cut through space, and even defeated Gremmy, who could potentially kill all of the Quincy, except Yhwach of course\nNow how would I change this? Aight…\nThere was no need for Giselle to dodge Zaraki's attacks here. She should've just stood there and let Zaraki dice her up. Her blood would've splashed him without a doubt, she would easily regenerate and Zaraki would have turned into her own zombie and did whatever she ordered. What's better than having someone who is a threat to your team as a slave?\nThe Quincies here would've been nearly unstoppable with Zaraki on their side, it would've taken the strongest captains to stop Zaraki; that's if they would even stop him.\nWe would have seen more epic fights, and possibly Shinsui vs Zaraki here\nSince the Quincies have information about every single Soul Reaper in the Seireitei, Giselle would then make sure that Zaraki doesn't come into contact with Kisuke Urahara and/or Mayuri Kurotsuchi because look at how Mayuri easily dezombified her zombies and turned them into his slaves, and Kisuke is also a threat for his resourcefulness, he would've found a way to quickly dezombify Zaraki\nI really do feel like the Quincies would've dogwalked the Soul Society with Zaraki on their side. What y'all think?",
      "5": "A lot of people say that the creator of bleach is a terrible writer. I mean he's not the best I'm not gonna lie, but he's not the worst either.\nPersonally, I would've done some story elements differently.\nI would've fleshed out the characters a lot more. I don't understand why he didn't do this. He gave a lot of them interesting personalities in the beginning, but would exclude the majority of them from the story. Either that or he wouldn't build upon them hardly. At least in terms of writing.\nI would explain a lot of stuff different than he did, or didn't do at all. A big part of a story is to try your best to make sure that your reader doesn't get confused with what they're reading, and understands what they're looking at. He didn't do that very well a lot of times.\nI think the last thing I would change is just to keep a lot more things that were in the story relevant. For example, a lot of people gets confused about ichigos fullbringer powers. It's supposed to have merged with his shinigami, but Kubo hardly clarifies if he's using them or not. He could've at least done something with an attack name or something.\nI think the best of Kubo's writing was probably in the thousand year blood war arc. It's probably because he knew it was the end of it, and couldn't afford to have lazy writing. So he put more focus on it. That's my two cents ✌️.",
      "6": "I'd scrap the reveal with his parents and make him a Fullbringer from the get go. He's a member of Xcution before defecting to Soul Society after learning Ginjo's plan. Afterwards he's a provincial member of the Gotei working under the 13th division.\nThis could be retooled into a different character if people find it too different from what Bleach was.",
      "7": "I would probably have Ichigo battle weaker captains rather than the more powerful ones. Honestly, Ichigo beating Kenpachi and Byakuya was a bit of a stretch, considering how powerful they were portrayed to be later on. Either that, or make Kenpachi and Byakuya a bit weaker. Ichigo was shown to be relevant to Byakuya in speed in his Bankai form. Yet when he faced Grimmjow, he was completely outclassed. Which in itself is OK, if the goal was to show how powerful Grimmjow was. However, we then have Byakuya outspeeding Zommari even with one foot injured. Zommari said he had the fastest Sonido. Which of course, is likely not true, but the fact that Byakuya could easily keep up with Zommari yet Ichigo was getting destroyed by Grimmjow seems a bit strange.\nThen, I would probably have some changes made to Yhwach’s ‘Almighty’ powers. It’s honestly way too OP. If he can literally see all the possible futures and change them the way he wants, I don’t see any possible ways to stop him. Uryu did shoot the silver thing that stopped Yhwach’s powers, but that itself is a problem. If Yhwach could see the future, wouldn’t he have then saw the future in which Uryu shot the silver bullet? How did he not forsee that coming? Makes no sense. I also would add some hax powers to Ichigo’s bankai. He has a lot of raw power, but his only attack is Getsuga Tenshou. I mean, sure, it was shown later on that much of his true powers were being suppressed, but still, his lack of diversity was a bit disappointing.\nOverall though, the general storyline was decent, and the characters were extremely interesting. It’s just the power scaling that was a bit shaky, in addition to the MC’s lack of range in abilities."

It didn’t.\nThing is, nobody says it did.\nThe Lambda-CDM model says that the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since into the cold, sparse state we see now. In particular:\nThere was no “explosion.”\nAs you go further and further back toward the origin of the universe, gravitational time dilation tends to infinity.

We don’t know, and don’t claim to know, what happened before then.\nIf you have an image in your head of an endless flat black expanse of nothing and then at some point in that nothing something exploded, you’re not talking about current cosmology at all.",
      "2": "The reason why an explanation or theory of observable reality becomes the prevailing explanation or theory is because it is the most useful explanation. Basically, the theory that works best at explaining past observations and predicting future observations “wins.”\nNow, whatever you are thinking is the “Big Bang” theory, it is probably not what scientists and cosmologist who are making these observations of the wider observable universe think it is or what it actually is. I suggest you go down to your local library and ask the librarian for help finding a book that explains the Big Bang theory at a level you can comprehend. Don’t feel bad if you have to go back and find an even simpler version, that’s what librarians are for. You can work your way back to high-school level texts.\nThe present-day Big Bang theory is not a theory of creation. It is a cosmological model of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.\nThe “singularity” or “Primeval atom” view arises from the observation that galaxies in the observable universe are moving away from each other. They were therefore closer together yesterday than today and even closer the day before, and so on back to a very, very dense and very hot early universe. The stars must have been much closer together and the universe must have been hotter. That logically means that the further you go back in time the more dense and hot the universe becomes, eventually back to a very, very dense and very, very hot early universe. This is observable reality, which may be the answer to part of your question.\nIf you keep tracking backwards using Classical physics, you reach a single point. However, we now know that the universe is not classical. So there is a problem.\nThat problem currently (and maybe eternally) manifests at the end of the so-called Planck epoch. We just don’t know how to observe or even model how or what things happened any earlier.\nQ: Why is the Big Bang the most accepted theory if there was nothing before it to cause the explosion?",
      "3": "For a start, it wasn’t an explosion. Take a deflated balloon, and add helium does it explode or simply expand (assuming you don’t overfill)? The name Big Bang is a misnomer (created by a detractor) not a description of Father Lamaitre’s theory. Secondly, who says there was nothing? Scientists (including Krausse the author of “A Universe from Nothing”) generally say they don’t know what existed before the big bang or even if there was such a thing as the time before the event to make the question meaningful. There are a bunch of proposed answers but no one is certain nearly all of which suggest something (usually called the singularity which would have been a super dense point made of all of the energy that would one day make up the universe, yes that means matter to since we know from Einstein that energy can become matter).",
      "4": "There was no explosion… it was an expansion and inflation of spacetime itself. And it’s backed up by the fact that the Universe is still expanding (what else would cause that?) and the predicted remnants of CBR (Cosmic Background Radiation).

      "6": "First, to address a couple misconceptions. There was no explosion; there was, rather, an expansion. And the time up to “the start” hasn’t been accounted for, because it’s unclear quantum phenomena come into the picture.\nThe “Big Bang” framework is accepted because it explains the observations the best. Just as thermodynamics was developed before the atomic theory that would eventually explain its laws on a deeper level, a “Big Bang” model does not need to account for where it comes from.",
      "7": "The Big Bang theory is the prevailing explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe, and it is widely accepted by the scientific community. However, some people may wonder how this theory can be the most accepted one when it suggests that there was nothing before the explosion. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the acceptance of the Big Bang theory and address this particular question.\nWhat is the Big Bang Theory?\nThe Big Bang theory suggests that the universe originated from a single point of infinite density and temperature, known as a singularity. According to this theory, the universe began to expand rapidly in a massive explosion that occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. This expansion caused the universe to cool and allowed matter to form, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.\nObservational Evidence Supporting the Big Bang Theory\nThe Big Bang theory is supported by a vast amount of observational evidence, including:\nCosmic Microwave Background Radiation: In the 1960s, scientists discovered a faint microwave radiation that pervades the entire universe. This radiation is known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and it is considered one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory. The CMB is thought to be the residual heat left over from the Big Bang explosion.\nRedshift of Galaxies: When scientists observe distant galaxies, they notice that they are moving away from us. This is known as the redshift, and it suggests that the universe is expanding. The farther away a galaxy is, the greater its redshift. This observation supports the idea that the universe began as a single point and has been expanding ever since.\nAbundance of Light Elements: The Big Bang theory predicts the formation of light elements, such as helium and hydrogen, in the early universe. Observations of the abundance of these elements in the universe match the predictions of the Big Bang theory.\nLarge Scale Structure of the Universe: The Big Bang theory also predicts the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, such as clusters of galaxies and superclusters. Observations of the distribution of galaxies in the universe match the predictions of the Big Bang theory.\nWhy Was There Nothing Before the Big Bang?\nOne of the common questions people have about the Big Bang theory is why there was nothing before the explosion. This question stems from the misconception that the Big Bang was an explosion that occurred within a pre-existing space. However, the Big Bang was not an explosion that occurred within space, but rather the beginning of space and time itself. In other words, the Big Bang was the moment when the universe began to exist.\nThe singularity that existed before the Big Bang was not a point in space, but a point in time. Time did not exist before the Big Bang, and therefore there was no \"before\" the Big Bang. The singularity represented the beginning of time, space, and all matter and energy in the universe.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the Big Bang theory is the most accepted explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe because it is supported by a vast amount of observational evidence. The question of why there was nothing before the Big Bang is based on a misconception about the nature of the Big Bang. The singularity that existed before the Big Bang was not a point in space, but a point in time. Time did not exist before the Big Bang, and the singularity represented the beginning of time, space, and all matter and energy in the universe.",
      "8": "Any cosmology has to start with an uncaused cause. The initial state of the Big Bang is a state of extremely high density of energy, uniform throughout the universe. As uncaused causes go, this one has the virtue of extreme simplicity, and it fits all the facts about what happened between then and now.",
      "9": "Astronomers can see the known universe to be expanding and, using existing scientific knowledge, the expansion can be traced back to a tiny point in space, about 14 billion years ago, at which the universe was apparently created out of nothing. However, in order to explain the expansion of the universe, scientists have been forced to accept that all the known universe is really less than 5% of the real universe. The other 95% is either “dark matter” or “dark energy”, and scientists have no idea what this dark stuff is. Therefore, the theory of the Big Bang may well be modified in future. Don’t worry if you can’t imagine how the universe can be created out of nothing - scientists can’t imagine that either, even if they prove it to be likely, using math. Bear in mind that any explanation will either be that the universe has always existed, or that it started from nothing - and we can’t imagine either of those, right? Just like we cannot really imagine Einstein’s “space-time” continuum, even though it has been well proven to fit the facts.",
      "10": "The Big Bang Theory describes the evolution of the modern universe from some tiny fraction of a second after ‘something happened’ to initiate it all. That theory is now very well supported by evidence, which is why the theory is widely accepted.\nInflation Theory is a proposal for what may have happened prior to the Big Bang, that seems to make a lot of sense to experts, and is reasonably evidenced. Most experts consider it (or something like it) is likely true, even though we don’t have the full details worked out.\nWhat happened before that, is in the realm of speculation, and there is no evidence and no consensus about this.\nSo to answer your question why is the BB the most accepted theory, it’s because we have good evidence that this theory accurately describes what actually took place in the early times of the universe. Not knowing what happened before it, doesn’t undermine that evidence.",

The Big Bang (the Lambda CMB model) is an expansion of space time\nThe Big Bang does not say how the universe started. Only how it looked and how it changed\nIt is possible that the energy of the Big Bang always existed and there also a chance that the total energy in the Unvierse is zero (which is what I favour)\nThe Big Bang is support by a huge amount of observations evidence including..\nThe Cosmic Microwave Background\nThe element abundances\nThe age of stars\nThe large scale structure of the Universe\nHigh energy physics observations\n\nFrom you profile you seem to think the Unvierse will stop expanding.

      "15": "The Big Bang theory is currently the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe because it provides a comprehensive framework to explain many observed phenomena. While the term \"explosion\" might lead to misunderstandings, the Big Bang wasn't an explosion within pre-existing space; rather, it's the initial expansion of space itself.\nThe theory doesn't necessarily claim that there was \"nothing\" before it, but rather that the conditions and nature of the universe were fundamentally different in the extremely early stages. The Big Bang theory is based on observations like the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and the abundance of light elements, which support the idea that the universe was once in a very hot, dense state and has been expanding and evolving since then.\nWhile the question of what caused the Big Bang is still a subject of scientific inquiry, the theory has provided a solid foundation for understanding the universe's evolution and has been supported by a wide range of observations and experiments.",
      "16": "Who says there was nothing before it? Is that your theory? Just because we don’t know what was before the Big Bang, which was just a rapid expansion of spacetime, doesn’t mean it was nothing.

      "18": "There are many interpretations/posible explanations:\nThe universe had existed before the Big Bang, although in a somehow different state, and probably, different laws of physics. Some phenomenon caused it to collapse and then cause the Big Bang.\nThe multiverse in some form may be real. New universes then can come from already existing ones, or by other mechanisms.\nThere is no cause.\nTo be a cause, you have to be a past event prior to another one closely related. Since time itself didn’t exist before the Big Bang, there is, by definition, no cause. Similar to how there isn’t any point more towards the north than the north pole.",
      "19": "Well for starters there was no “explosion” it was an “expansion.” All evidence points to this happening. And only theists say there was nothing. No cosmologist says that.",
      "20": "Ready for a story?\nOnce upon a time, there was nothing. Absolutely nothing. No galaxies, no stars, no planets, no light, no sound. Just pure emptiness. It was so empty that even the concept of emptiness didn't exist. But then, one day, something happened. No one knows what triggered it, not even me. But suddenly, there was a burst of energy, so intense that it was like a huge explosion. It was the Big Bang. And from that explosion, everything was born. Galaxies formed, stars ignited, planets were born, and the universe began to expand.\nNow, you might ask, \"But, what caused the Big Bang? What was there before it?\" And to that, I say, \"Who knows?\" Maybe it was the result of some natural process that we don't understand yet. Maybe it was a divine creation. Maybe it was just pure chance. Or maybe, just maybe, it was because the universe was tired of being nothing and wanted to create something, anything. But here's the thing, my friend. The Big Bang theory is not just some wild guess. It's based on actual observations and evidence. Scientists have studied the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and the behavior of stars and planets to come up with this theory. And so far, it's the most plausible explanation we have.\nSo, the next time you look up at the sky and wonder about the origin of the universe, just remember this story. The universe was once empty, but now it's full of wonder and beauty. And the Bi\ng Bang, whether it was caused by science or magic or sheer willpower, gave birth to it all.\nKEEP THE MIND HUNGRY FOR KNOWLEDGE",
      "21": "There are huge amounts of evidence for “The Big Bang”. The idea, that there was nothing before “The Big Bang” is an interpretation of “The Big Bang Theory”, which is plausible, but not a part of the theory itself and no hard evidence exist for this interpretation.",
      "22": "The Big Bang theory describes the origins of the universe, based on extensive observations and measurements of the universe's current state. It explains how the universe began as an extremely hot and dense state, and has since expanded and cooled over billions of years to form the universe as we know it today.\nThe idea of the Big Bang is supported by several lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the large-scale structure of the universe. These observations suggest that the universe began as a very hot, dense, and uniform state, and has since expanded and cooled over billions of years.\nHowever, the Big Bang theory does not attempt to explain what caused the universe to begin in this state. It is simply a description of how the universe has evolved since that time. Some theories suggest that the universe could have emerged from a quantum fluctuation or a collision between multiple universes, but these ideas are still speculative and require further research.\nIn summary, while the Big Bang theory does not explain what caused the universe to begin, it is supported by a wide range of observational evidence and is currently the most widely accepted scientific explanation for the origins and evolution of the universe.",
      "23": "The Big Bang theory doesn’t say that there was nothing before the Big Bang (whatever before means knowing that time also emerged at the Big Bang) but that the equations of General Relativity don’t allow us to know what was before (and no direct observation is possible neither) so they must be incomplete (especially when we realize that they are incompatible with the other big building bloc of cosmology which is Quantum Mechanics). That’s why scientists work on string theory, quantum loop gravity and other theories to go beyond.",
      "24": "Who says there was nothing before the big-bang?\nJust because we don’t know what all the matter & energy of this universe was doing before the big-bang, is no reason to think it didn’t exist.\nIf a horse walks out from behind a building and you see it for the first time, do you think it didn’t exist before you saw it?",

The Big Bang was a pejorative description by a critic, but the name was adopted by advocates.\nIf someone as ignorant of science as I am knows this, it can only be willful ignorance that perpetuates the stupid claim that there was an explosion. I'd be willing to bet apologists would easily accept the Big Bang if it included the claim that “God did it”\nThen there's the “nothing before the big bang” imbroglio.

      "28": "It is imperfect, exactly because physicists are not paying (much) attention to the prior state.\nIn the Big Whisper theory, the reason the prior state ended is the essential point, naturally based on the evidence we have and this pointing back to what must have happened.\nFirst, what we know:\n1/ Matter first appeared some 13.8 billion years ago\n2/ Energy does not get lost\nNote that we have good evidence where matter came from, but that there is zero data about the beginning of energy, time or space. To declare them absent requires evidence for which there is none. To declare them present already, we actually have lots of data, because the entire result screams rather loud that there was a prior state from which the result arrived.\nSo, how to approach this? I’ll show this in relatively simple manners:\n1/ An omelet is a result that did not just come from an egg, it was capable of becoming an omelet only after the egg first broke.\nConclusion: the prior state broke in a fundamental aspect.\n2/ A toy wound up so that its winding mechanism broke used to perform a special trick, but cannot do so today.\nConclusion: the prior state had one additional function, now gone.\nThe Big Bang model has no orange line how the prior state ended. The Big Whisper model proffers an explanation, and this changes the view on the outcome in two important ways:\n1/ There was no super-hot starting point (while heat was produced it was not super-hot)\n2/ There is no need for a cosmic inflation period because matter did not originate from the center but from Zone 2.",
      "29": "The “there was nothing before it” part is an unjustified assumption - and it’s not part of the theory. Let me quote the relevant section of the Wikipedia article on the Big Bang:\n“The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.[1] Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.”\nSo, you see, the theory only tells us what happened after a certain point in time. To me, “the Universe came from nothing” sounds more like a strawman argument against the Big Bang theory.

Another phrase, as nonsensical, is “space itself is expanding”, an attempt to verbalize a geometric (seeming) impossibility: centerless dispersion.

However, the theory has been extensively tested and validated by a wide range of observational data, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the observed distribution of galaxies and large-scale structures, and the abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium in the universe.\nIn summary, the Big Bang theory is the most accepted scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe because it is supported by a large body of observational and theoretical evidence, despite the fact that the cause of the Big Bang is still a subject of ongoing research and debate",

      "1": "Obviously you know the answer perfectly well, but since you asked…\nWhat causes us not to want to eat it is the fact that in order to buy it you have to financially reward people for having done things that inflicted excruciating suffering on innocent sentient beings. That’s why, as obviously you knew. It’s not that we don’t like the taste. I remember perfectly well after 28 years that it tasted good and that claim is not in dispute.\nFurthermore, if anyone wishes to dispute the underlying factual claim here, I refer you to “Animal Liberation”, or “The Ethics of What We Eat”, or the Wikipedia article on factory farming, or the Compassion in World Farming website, or I encourage you to visit farms, or read the very agricultural journals contributed to by the farmers themselves, however if anyone attempts to debate me along these lines or deny what I’m saying, I will not engage at all (nor will I pay attention to any claims about nuances about “free-range farming” or “grass-fed beef”, given that 99 per cent of the meat on supermarket shelves is factory-farmed). Google has been invented. Not my problem if you want to shut your eyes to the facts.",
      "2": "“What causes vegans to not want to eat steak, the most delicious food known to mankind?” You are misinformed; Veganism has nothing to do with deliciousness. Veganism is a moral choice, not a foodie choice.",
      "3": "You do know that not everyone has the same taste right? This is the converse of people asking why vegans want vegan food to taste like steak or animal meat. And they’re both equally as ridiculous.",
      "4": "If you think that steak is delicious you probable never even ate a good meat dish. Let alone the better food out there.",
      "5": "Vegans choose not to eat steak because they follow a plant-based diet and believe in abstaining from consuming animal products. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, and what may be delicious to one person may not be appealing to another. It's all about personal choices and values! 😊",
      "6": "Because it comes from someone with a FACE and EMOTIONS and THOUGHTS?\nWHY would this ever need to be explained?!\nYes, Animals Think And Feel.

      "7": "A person's fondness for or opposition to a certain dish, such as steak, depends on their personal preferences, worldviews, and dietary habits. Steak may be the most delectable cuisine in the opinion of some, but others may refrain from eating it for a variety of reasons, particularly if they follow a vegan diet. Here are some typical explanations for why vegans might abstain from steak and other animal products:\nAnimal welfare and ethical issues: Animal suffering and the treatment of animals in the meat industry are ethical issues that many vegans opt to avoid. They can be against the methods used to raise and kill animals for sustenance.\nEnvironmental Sustainability: Environmental concerns are a driving force for some vegans. They think that lowering or eliminating animal agriculture can lessen the effects of livestock production on the environment and assist combat climate change.\nHealth and nutrition: Vegans frequently place a high priority on maintaining plant-based diets. They could think that a diet high in plant-based foods can give them the nutrients they require while lowering their risk of certain health problems connected to consuming large amounts of meat, such as heart disease and specific types of cancer.\nPersonal taste preferences and cultural considerations are important variables in determining what foods are chosen. Even though some individuals appreciate the flavor of steak, others might not have grown up eating it or may not like the way meat tastes or feels.\nVegan substitutes: A vast range of plant-based foods and meat alternatives are available to vegans, and they can imitate the tastes and textures of items derived from animals. These substitutes can offer vegans great and satiating options without the need for meat.\nDietary limitations: Some people are unable to eat certain foods, including meat, due to dietary limitations or allergies. In certain situations, medical or health factors have an impact on their food decisions.\nRecognizing that what one person thinks appetizing or appealing could not be the same for another is crucial. People have a wide range of food choices because taste is so subjective. A combination of ethical, environmental, health, and personal considerations that are in line with their values guide vegans' dietary decisions.",
      "8": "Well, the obvious answer is that vegans don’t select their diet based on your opinion of how good a certain kind of meat tastes.\nJust for the record, suggesting that a plain cut of meat, however well seasoned, might be better than a million combinations of other ingredients is… somewhat blinkered.\nI’ve eaten a lot of high quality food. A chateaubriand that I once had at a Michelin-starred restaurant in London is the only time a steak might have made my top 20 favourite meals.\nI can think of a load of things off the top of my head that I’d rather cook than steak. Some of them are vegan. And I can cook steak properly.",

Our prefereces are unique to our regional foods….Mongolians would have a different menu of preferred food.

Steak is way down of that list and after about 6 months on a plant centric diet, it stinks worse than a cigarette.",

      "14": "Back when I was in college during a Theory and Criticism module, we were shown the commutation test which could be deployed to examine any morality based questions, or issues of ethics. So if we were to use such a test on the question you posed, we could substitute another subject in the place of the other animals in question:\nOriginal Question reads: ‘What causes vegans to not want to eat steak, the most delicious food known to mankind?’\nBut this utterly misunderstands what veganism is, and why vegans don't eat the dismembered flesh of other animals. Firstly, veganism is not a diet. It is a philosophy and whole lifestyle that seeks to avoid the use of other animals in any way. To use any animal is a rights violation.\nSo, with a very brief outline of what veganism actually is, your original question would more appropriately be:\n‘What causes vegans to not want to violate the rights of another animal without their consent, no matter how much pleasure they may derive from such a violation?\nNow perform the commutation test, and substitute the other animals for say ‘Women’.\n‘What causes men to not want to violate the rights of women without their consent, no matter how much pleasure they may derive from such a violation?\nYou could also substitute children in the place of the other animals in another commutation test.\nSo the question vegans would like to ask nonvegans is: in a world where there is an abundance of delicious plant based foods, readily available all year round, why would you choose to violate the rights of other animals for no justifiable reason?",
      "15": "People choose to follow vegan diets for various reasons, and their decision not to eat steak or any other animal products is typically rooted in ethical, environmental, health, or personal beliefs. Here are some of the primary reasons why vegans avoid eating steak or any other animal-derived foods:\nEthical and Compassionate Reasons: Many vegans are motivated by a concern for the welfare of animals. They believe that consuming meat, including steak, involves the exploitation and suffering of animals in the meat industry. They choose to avoid animal products to reduce harm to animals and promote a more compassionate way of living.\nEnvironmental Concerns: The meat industry, particularly beef production, is associated with significant environmental impacts such as deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage. Some vegans choose plant-based diets as a way to reduce their ecological footprint and combat climate change.\nHealth and Nutrition: Some people adopt vegan diets for health reasons. They believe that plant-based diets can offer various health benefits, including a reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. While steak may be delicious to some, many vegans prioritize their health and well-being by choosing alternative sources of protein and nutrients.\nCultural and Personal Beliefs: Personal or cultural beliefs and values can play a significant role in a person's decision to follow a vegan lifestyle. Some individuals are raised in vegan or vegetarian households, while others adopt these diets as a result of personal values or religious beliefs.\nAnimal Agriculture Practices: Vegans may also be concerned about the industrial practices associated with animal agriculture, including overcrowding, the use of antibiotics, and the treatment of animals. They may choose to abstain from steak and other meat products due to these concerns.\nIt's essential to recognize that personal preferences for food can vary widely from person to person. What one person finds delicious, another may not, and taste preferences are subjective. Vegans make their dietary choices based on a combination of ethical, environmental, health, and personal considerations rather than the perceived taste of a particular food.\nUltimately, the decision to follow a vegan diet is a personal one, and individuals choose it for a range of reasons that align with their values and beliefs.",
      "16": "Vegetarians decide not to eat steak or any creature items because of multiple factors, which can incorporate moral, ecological, and wellbeing contemplations. It's critical to comprehend that taste is emotional, and what one individual finds delectable, another may not. Here are a few normal motivations behind why vegetarians stay away from steak:\n1. **Ethical Concerns**: Numerous vegetarians are spurred by moral worries for creatures. They decide to stay away from creature items to lessen the anguish and abuse of creatures in the food business. Steak comes from the butcher of cows, and this can struggle with their moral convictions.\n2. **Environmental Impact**: The creation of meat, including steak, has a critical natural effect, adding to deforestation, ozone depleting substance outflows, and water utilization. A few vegetarians pick a plant-based diet to diminish their ecological impression.\n3. **Health Considerations**: Certain individuals take on a veggie lover diet for wellbeing reasons. They accept that plant-based diets can bring down the gamble of specific medical issue, like coronary illness and particular sorts of malignant growth, and advance in general prosperity.\n4. **Cultural or Individual Values**: Veganism can be impacted by social or individual qualities that focus on peacefulness, manageability, and sympathy. These qualities might lead people to abstain from consuming creature items, including steak.\n5. **Taste Preferences**: While a vegetarians may not find steak engaging because of individual taste inclinations, it's essential to take note of that plant-based eats less carbs offer a wide assortment of tasty and fulfilling food sources that take care of various preferences.\nEventually, the choice to stay away from steak or a particular food is an individual decision in light of a blend of moral, natural, wellbeing, and individual variables. Taste is only one component in the complicated condition that impacts dietary decisions.",

    "answers": {
      "1": "I think it would, without doubt.\nThe US is not going to stand back and be attacked by Russia.\nThe attack would trigger article 5 of NATO and the obligations of all members.\nWWIII would result.\nBut the chances of Russia attacking the US are significantly lower than me winning the Powerball lottery.",
      "2": "Since an EMP attack is created by an ICBM nuclear missile exploding over the continental United States, that would be considered a nuclear attack on the US. Probably the US response would be to use their ballistic missile submarines to launch a comparative attack on Russia, knocking out their communications, command and control and logistics facilities, without launching a massive strike on Russian cities. That is, IF Russia did not launch more than 1 ICBM at the US, and if they did not follow up their initial attack by an assault on US military facilities or cities.\nSuch an EMP attack would be utterly futile because of the existence of submarines not affected by such an attack. The US triad of nuclear forces including submarines, is sufficient to guarantee deterrence even if the land forces are rendered incapable due to a surprise attack.",
      "3": "Yes - and likely even before the EMP attack can even hit.\nTo launch such an attack, Russia would have to launch one or several ICBMs at the USA - or go with a FOBS attack.\nBut both are detectable, at least short-term - unscheduled launches from anywhere in Russia with a specific pattern of orbits (for a FOBS) or ICBM launches would be seen long before first-stage burnout, by satellite reconnaissance. They basically see the ignition flash of the engines itself at launch.\nAnd this alone could trigger an all-out first-strike response from the US.\nIf Russia put the necessary payloads in orbit years ago (a version of a FOBS), the picture only goes marginally more grim - because US military assets (and especially the nuclear component) are hardened against this type of attack. (The USA pumped billions of dollars into this.)\nGive them a few minutes to „clear the storm“ after detonation.\nAnd after that, God himself will be astonished by the magnitude of wrath humans can unleash.\nBecause besides the USA, there would be all the other NATO members that would be… pissed.\nSeverely so.",
      "4": "The act of detonating a nuclear EMP weapon (for that is what they are) is, by definition, an Act of War. Proportional response is possible, IF Putin (Russia can’t start a WW3, only Putin can) isn’t stoopid and responds to a proportional response. If he remains stoopid, then a large scale great nation (sic) war is likely. Whether or not the entire world retaliates is an interesting question. Certainly Article 5 of the NATO Charter is automatically invoked, and their political leaderhsip would elevate their readiness status to a something akin to DEFCON 1.\nWhat type of response comes from the non-nuclear alllies is speculative. I could see attacks by the Scandinavians, Poland, and the Baltic States against conventional naval targets, and blockades of the exit from the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Norwegian Sea. Russian submarines would flush out of Murmansk and the White Sea anyway, but nearly all are tracked soon, and they’ll be hunted down trying to attempt a breakout. Some will leak out. More SLBMs.\nThe Aegean and Black Sea would see the death of the great (sic) Russian Fleets trying to sortie out of the Sea of Azov and the Russian ports in Crimea. Cruise missiles would be everywhere, and surface ships would burn from ASMs launched by ships, aircraft, and ground bases in Romania, Greece, and Turkey. France and Spain would flush their Mediterranean ports, and the UK would blockade the Strait of Gibraltar. Submarines in the Med are are a disadvantage, but surface warfare ASW groups also are hindered by shallow seas and sonar reflections in the key choke points and littoral areas all hosting NATO countries. So much underwater noise and surface chaos would make for a confusing situation, and maybe some hesitation regarding IFF on distant targets.\nWould this lead to a world-wide conflict? Korea would certainly want to use its nukes now that the gloves are off, so expect strikes against Japan and the ROK, maybe even Australia, and Vietnam. China MIGHT wait-and-see. They could benefit from a Russian ass-whupping, and the diversion of American and NATO resources to sink the Soviet/Russian fleets. It could get messy identifying who is shooting at whom. Sort of like a grown up version of shootout at the OK Corral.\nGood luck!",
      "5": "What kind of EMP attack? The assumption seems to be that this would be a multi-warhead strategic strike using nuclear weapons detonating exo-atmospherically to generate the EMP pulse. And that’s pretty much what it would take to make an instant, continent-wide EMP attack on the US.\nBut, as the movie magic of George Clooney has shown us (Oceans 11 remake), you can whomp up a seriously crippling EMP weapon that’ll fit in the back of a delivery van. So Russia, in theory, could launch a non-nuclear EMP attack on the US. And if, in this odd scenario, such an attack was clearly not intended to be a strategic attack, then perhaps not.\nPut it this way, if a country or entity other than Russia or China launched a non-strategic EMP attack on the US—localized to one metropolitan area, for example—then…well, it would depend on who was President, wouldn’t it? Post-Trump, let’s face it, many of our assumptions about employment of strategic nuclear weapons seems a little iffy. But back when I studied this stuff in political science classes, we used the Rational Actor model for tracing out political decision trees for situations like this.\nThe President of the United States is presumed to be a rational actor in all of the official employment scenarios for strategic weapons that I’ve ever seen discussed in the open literature. So no, for a single, localized EMP attack—say some form of terrorist attack—the president would not, presumably, order a massive nuclear retaliatory response.",
      "6": "If Putin did something this stupid, there would be a lot of really POed people in the United States. Assuming that President Biden was still in office, I'm confident that there a specific and appropriate response in retaliation; but, an unlikely a nuclear response. Putin is well aware that a response from Biden would be much more significant than a response from former President Trump, Putin’s close buddy. The optimum time for such an attack would be, if and when, the Trump Confederate Republican Party had so weakened the Biden Administration, that the United States was simply unable to adequately respond!",
      "7": "The key word here is “attack”. So I don't really care what kind of attack Russia launched. There would be a response in kind by the USA and its NATO Allies.

      "10": "Yes, it would probably start WW3.\nI will say that EMP has been over-rated in the popular media. One example is the street lights in Hawaii. That may or may not have been the result of nuclear tests, but it only affected some street lights and it didn’t affect anything else. The technical reason that might happen are discussed in the report below. But to hear the media talk about it you would get the impression that everything in Hawaii was knocked out. The point is, the nature of the effect is such that it won’t affect everything over a wide area, as is popularly supposed. But the effect can be use in war, the US has an EMP missile that can attack multiple times after being launched.\nA few years ago, Congress mandated hardening of our power system that will make them more resistant. The military has been working on hardening their systems for a much longer time.Few systems are completely resistant (they can be), but a lot of what I read is fear mongering to sell media stories.\nDid high-altitude EMP (electromagnetic pulse) cause the Hawaiian streetlight incident\nVittitoe, C N.

    "title": "Do zookeepers pet tigers",
    "answers": {
      "1": "There has been a massive clampdown on that kind of thing recently. There was one particular establishment in the UK where the now deceased owner would encourage his keepers to mingle with the tigers. In 1980 a tigress called Zeya killed two keepers within a couple of weeks. In 1994 another keeper died after an incident with a Siberian tiger.\nWhat goes on out of hours away from the cameras of the public is of course not known but certainly zoos in the Uk have moved away from this kind of thing. At the zoo I worked at, we had far too much respect for our tigers to treat them like large cuddly toys. This is a tiger after all, one of nature’s greatest predators and we made them work for a living.\nWe would hide their food all over the compound, there were puzzles to solve, with and without reward. Trails were laid, again with or without reward to simulate unsuccessful hunts. The enclosure itself had shelter, water, scrub, a den, grass and platforms. The rewards were wonderful. Our tigers had shiny fur, were alert and always on patrol round the compound as they would be in the wild and would growl at people through the viewing window. If any of us went in there, we would not have lasted long !! They were as wild as we could make them.\nThe tiger is a wild animal and deserves to be treated as such. It is not a soft toy. If you make a mistake and ignore the safety protocols ……….. you only get to make that mistake once.\nPic credit - Toronto Zoo (not where I worked)",
      "2": "Yes. We have to train them to present their flank for vet exams. This reduces the amount of times they need to be anesthetized and allows us to physically check on the animal and even draw blood without tranquilizing them. Generally there are still bars, harp wire, or chainlink fencing between cat and human. Also, while assisting vets on ultrasounds and other procedures, I've actually been in with full grown and juvenile Siberian Tigers while they were sedated and petted them many times.",
      "3": "It is generally not recommended for zookeepers or other individuals to pet tigers or other big cats, as they are wild animals and can be dangerous if not handled properly.\nZookeepers who work with tigers and other big cats usually receive specialized training to learn how to safely interact with the animals and provide for their care. This may involve using protective barriers, specialized tools, and other safety equipment to minimize the risk of injury.\nWhile some individual tigers may be more docile and tolerant of human contact than others, it is important to...",
      "4": "Mostly, no. But each animal has a personality. I once did a photography course where a zoo keeper was my subject. He would stress upon this, that each cat is different. Its very imp to know that if you dont want to be mauled. He would give the tigers a wide berth, except for one female, who was very ‘affectionate’. Even then, he would scratch her behind her ear through the bars. She would purr and rub against the bars, but that was the limit of the interaction.\nThe lions were a bit more playful. Though he would never enter their enclosure, he would play with them around their fence.\nThe leopards are the scariest. One kind guard went to push back a piece of meat that was sticking out from the cage, the leopard reached out through the bars and ripped open his arm from wrist to elbow. He said it moved so fast, he had no time to react.\nSo yes, they do pet the cats occasionally, but with all safety measures maintained.",
      "5": "And, for the record, zookeepers only interact with animals with a protective barrier in place; they would never pet, hug or take a selfie with a tiger.",
      "6": "Do zookeepers pet tigers?\nUsually only twice.",
      "7": "Of course not. They only interact with them through fences. They talk to them and make friends, but no petting. That would be extremely foolish.",

      "1": "If it utilises NATO weaponry within Russia proper it becomes a diplomatic problem for the NATO countries…they can be utilised with impunity within the borders of Ukraine occupied or unoccupied which includes Crimea.\nIt has a domestic industry manufacturing drones and shorter distance missiles which it uses at Russian Russian targets.…as well those maritime drones.",
      "2": "“ Scared”; really? What are you talking about ?! If you bothered to pay attention , the Ukrainians have been taking the fight , by all means at their disposal, ( although by their own , creative means , to bring the “ reality “ of war to their tormentors. The issue is the, agreements made by the allied governments , with Ukraine to limit their retaliatory strikes, using western technology , to military targets within Ukrainian territory. Since the war began , the Ukrainians have developed several effect drones , missiles and mini water drones to destroy, asymmetrically , strategic targets of the enemy. ( fuel depots , airports ,control centers , radar stations , logistical store houses , troop bases, etc,) I suggest that you brush up on your reading .",

      "6": "There are a few reasons why Ukraine is scared of striking deep into Russia, despite the devastation that Russia has inflicted on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.\nRisk of escalation. Striking deep into Russia could lead to a significant escalation of the conflict. Russia could respond by attacking NATO targets or using weapons of mass destruction.\nLimited capabilities. Ukraine's long-range strike capabilities are limited. It does not have many weapons that can strike targets deep inside Russia.\nRetaliation. Russia is likely to retaliate against any Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory. This could lead to more civilian casualties and damage to Ukrainian infrastructure.\nPolitical considerations. Ukraine is trying to maintain the support of the West. A strike on Russian territory could alienate some Western governments and make it more difficult for Ukraine to secure military and financial assistance.\nDespite these risks, Ukraine has launched some limited strikes on Russian territory. For example, in April 2022, Ukraine attacked a fuel depot in Belgorod, Russia. However, Ukraine has been careful to avoid launching strikes on major Russian cities or other targets that could lead to a significant escalation of the conflict.\nOverall, Ukraine is scared of striking deep into Russia because of the risk of escalation, its limited capabilities, the potential for retaliation, and political considerations. However, Ukraine has launched some limited strikes on Russian territory, and it is possible that it will continue to do so in the future if it believes that it is necessary to defend itself.\nIt is also worth noting that Ukraine's reluctance to strike deep into Russia is not a sign of weakness. It is simply a recognition of the risks involved. Ukraine is fighting a war against a much larger and more powerful enemy. It needs to be careful to avoid actions that could lead to a defeat or a wider war.",

But \"Operation Mongoose\" fails due to poor planning, security, and backing. The planners had imagined the invasion would spark a popular uprising against Castro -– which never happens. A promised American air strike also never occurs. -cia.gov 1961: Dominican Republic — The CIA assassinates Rafael Trujillo, a murderous dictator Washington has supported since 1930. Trujillo’s business interests have grown so large (about 60 percent of the economy) that they have begun competing with American business interests. -warfarehistorynetwork.com 1961: Ecuador — The CIA-backed military forces democratically elected President Jose Velasco to resign. Vice President Carlos Arosemana replaces him; the CIA fills the now vacant vice presidency with its own man. -Journal of Latin American Studies | Cambridge.org 1961: Congo (Zaire) — The CIA assassinates the democratically elected Patrice Lumumba. However, public support for Lumumba’s politics runs so high that the CIA cannot clearly install his opponents in power. Four years of political turmoil follow. -democracynow.org 1963: Dominican Republic — The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Juan Bosch in a military coup. The CIA installs a repressive, right-wing junta. -Wikipedia 1963: Ecuador — A CIA-backed military coup overthrows President Arosemana, whose independent (not socialist) policies have become unacceptable to Washington. A military junta assumes command, cancels the 1964 elections, and begins abusing human rights. -Wikipedia 1964: Brazil — A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. In the next two decades, the junta that replaces it will become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. General Castelo Branco will create Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down \"communists\" for torture, interrogation, and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trains the death squads. -brown.edu 1965: Indonesia — The CIA overthrows the democratically elected Sukarno with a military coup. The CIA has been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957, using everything from attempted assassination to sexual intrigue, for nothing more than his declaring neutrality in the Cold War. General Suharto's successor will massacre 500,000 to 1 million civilians accused of being \"communists.\" The CIA supplies the names of countless suspects. -JSTOR 1965: Greece — With the CIA’s backing, the king removes George Papandreou as prime minister. Papandreou has failed to vigorously support U.S. interests in Greece. -inteltoday.org 1965: Congo (Zaire) — A CIA-backed military coup installs Mobutu Sese Seko as dictator. The hated and repressive Mobutu exploits his desperately poor country for billions. -Global Research 1966: The Ramparts Affair — The radical magazine Ramparts begins a series of unprecedented anti-CIA articles. Among their scoops: the CIA has paid the University of Michigan $25 million dollars to hire “professors” to train South Vietnamese students in covert police methods. MIT and other universities have received similar payments. Ramparts also reveals that the National Students’ Association is a CIA front. Students are sometimes recruited through blackmail and bribery, including draft deferments. -inteltoday.org * 1976: CIA Memo 1967: CIA Coined and Weaponized the Label \"Conspiracy Theory.” The CIA released a dispatch that coined the label “conspiracy theory” and “conspiracy theorists” to attack anyone who challenged the official narrative from the Warren Commission concerning the Kennedy assassination. The document is labeled “psych” for psychological operations or disinformation. “CS copy” is also marked at the bottom, meaning “Clandestine Services” Unit. After the 1960s, the word “conspiracy theory,” “conspiracy theorist,” and “conspiracy” started having a negative connotation and is enough to silence anyone who questions the official narrative. To this day, we still view conspiracy theorists as crazy tinfoil hatters. -Global Research * Released to The New York Times in 1976 via The Freedom of Information Act. 1967: Greece — A CIA-backed military coup overthrows the government two days before the elections. The favorite to win was George Papandreou, the liberal candidate. During the next six years, the “reign of the colonels” — backed by the CIA — will usher in the widespread use of torture and murder against political opponents. When a Greek ambassador objects to President Johnson about U.S. plans for Cyprus, Johnson tells him: “Fuck your parliament and your constitution.” -Global Research 1967: Operation PHEONIX — The CIA helps South Vietnamese agents identify and then murder alleged Viet Cong leaders operating in South Vietnamese villages. According to a 1971 congressional report, this operation killed about 20,000 “Viet Cong.” --Global Research 1968: Operation CHAOS — The CIA has been illegally spying on American citizens since 1959, but President Johnson dramatically boosts the effort with Operation CHAOS. CIA agents go undercover as student radicals to spy on and disrupt campus organizations protesting the Vietnam War. They are searching for Russian instigators, which they never find. CHAOS will eventually spy on 7,000 individuals and 1,000 organizations. --Global Research 1968: Bolivia — A CIA-organized military operation captures legendary guerilla Che Guevara. The CIA wants to keep him alive for interrogation, but the Bolivian government executes him to prevent worldwide calls for clemency. -inteltoday.org 1969: Uruguay — The notorious CIA torturer Dan Mitrione arrives in Uruguay, a country torn with political strife. Whereas right-wing forces previously used torture only as a last resort, Mitrione convinces them to use it as a routine, widespread practice. “The precise pain, in the precise place, in the precise amount, for the desired effect,” is his motto. The torture techniques he teaches to the death squads rival the Nazis. He becomes so afraid that revolutionaries will kidnap and murder him a year later. -Global Research 1970: Cambodia — The CIA overthrows Prince Sahounek, who is highly popular among Cambodians for keeping them out of the Vietnam War. He is replaced by CIA puppet Lon Nol, who immediately throws Cambodian troops into battle. This unpopular move strengthened once minor opposition parties like the Khmer Rouge, which achieved power in 1975 and massacred millions of its own people. -Global Research 1971: Bolivia — After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped, and executed. -Aletho News 1971: Haiti — “Papa Doc” Duvalier dies, leaving his 19-year-old son “Baby Doc” Duvalier the dictator of Haiti. His son continues his bloody reign with full knowledge of the CIA. -Aletho News 1972: The Case-Zablocki Act — Congress passes an act requiring congressional review of executive agreements. In theory, this should make CIA operations more accountable. In fact, it is only marginally effective. -Aletho News 1972: Wagergate Break-in — President Nixon sends in a team of burglars to wiretap Democratic offices at Watergate. The team members have extensive CIA histories, including James McCord, E. Howard Hunt and five of the Cuban burglars. They work for the Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP), which does dirty work like disrupting Democratic campaigns and laundering Nixon’s illegal campaign contributions. CREEP’s activities are funded and organized by another CIA front, the Mullen Company. -Aletho News 1973: Chile — The CIA overthrows and assassinates Salvador Allende, Latin America’s first democratically elected socialist leader. The problems begin when Allende nationalizes American-owned firms in Chile. ITT offers the CIA $1 million for a coup (reportedly refused). The CIA replaced Allende with General Augusto Pinochet, who will torture and murdered thousands of his countrymen in a crackdown on labor leaders and the political left. -inteltoday.org 1975: Australia — The CIA helps topple the democratically elected, left-leaning government of Prime Minister Edward Whitlam. The CIA does this by giving an ultimatum to its Governor-General, John Kerr. Kerr, a longtime CIA collaborator, exercises his constitutional right to dissolve the Whitlam government. The Governor-General is a largely ceremonial position appointed by the Queen; the Prime Minister is democratically elected. The use of this archaic and never-used law stuns the nation. -inteltoday.org 1975: Angola — Eager to demonstrate American military resolve after its defeat in Vietnam, Henry Kissinger launches a CIA-backed war in Angola. The CIA backs the brutal leader of UNITAS, Jonas Savimbi. This polarizes Angolan politics and drives his opponents into the arms of Cuba and the Soviet Union for survival. This entirely pointless war kills over 300,000 Angolans. -inteltoday.org 1975: The Rockefeller Commission — President Ford creates the “Rockefeller Commission” to whitewash CIA history and propose toothless reforms. The commission’s namesake, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, is himself a major CIA figure. Five of the commission’s eight members are also members of the Council on Foreign Relations, a CIA-dominated organization. -Aletho News 1975: Nicaragua — Anastasios Samoza II, the CIA-backed dictator, falls. The Marxist Sandinistas took over the government, and they were initially popular because of their commitment to land and anti-poverty reform. Samoza had a murderous and hated personal army called the National Guard. Remnants of the Guard will become the Contras, who fight a CIA-backed guerilla war against the Sandinista government throughout the 1980s. -inteltoday.org 1980: El Salvador — The Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero, pleads with President Carter “Christian to Christian” to stop aiding the military government in slaughtering his people. Carter refuses. Right-wing leader Roberto D’Aubuisson immediately shoots Romero through the heart while saying Mass. The country soon dissolves into civil war, with the peasants in the hills fighting against the military government. The CIA and U.S. Armed Forces supply overwhelming military and intelligence superiority to the government. CIA-trained death squads roam the countryside, committing atrocities like that of El Mazote in 1982, where they massacre between 700 and 1000 men, women, and children. By 1992, some 63,000 Salvadorans will be killed. -inteltoday.org 1981: Iran/Contra Begins — The CIA begins selling arms to Iran at high prices, using the profits to arm the Contras fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. President Reagan vows that the Sandinistas will be “pressured” until “they say ‘uncle.’” The CIA’s Freedom Fighter’s Manual disbursed to the Contras includes instruction on economic sabotage, propaganda, extortion, bribery, blackmail, interrogation, torture, murder, and political assassination. -inteltoday.org 1983: Honduras — The CIA gives Honduran military officers the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual – 1983, which teaches how to torture people. Honduras’ notorious “Battalion 316” then uses these techniques, with the CIA’s full knowledge, on thousands of leftist dissidents. At least 184 are murdered. -inteltoday.org 1983: Haiti — Rising popular revolt in Haiti means that “Baby Doc” Duvalier will remain “President for Life” only if he has a short one. The U.S., which hates instability in a puppet country, flies the despotic Duvalier to the South of France for a comfortable retirement. The CIA then rigs the upcoming elections in favor of another right-wing military strongman. However, violence keeps the country in political turmoil for another four years. The CIA tries to strengthen the military by creating the National Intelligence Service (SIN), which suppresses popular revolt through torture and assassination. -Aletho News 1989: Panama — The U.S. invades Panama to overthrow a dictator of its own making, General Manuel Noriega. Noriega has been on the CIA’s payroll since 1966 and has been transporting drugs with the CIA’s knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega’s growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington… so out he goes. -Aletho News 1990: Haiti — Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. However, after only eight months in power, the CIA-backed military deposes him. More military dictators brutalize the country as thousands of Haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. As popular opinion calls for Aristide’s return, the CIA begins a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable. -Aletho News 1991: The Gulf War — The U.S. liberates Kuwait from Iraq. But Iraq’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, is another creature of the CIA. With U.S. encouragement, Hussein invaded Iran in 1980. During this costly eight-year war, the CIA built up Hussein’s forces with sophisticated arms, intelligence, training, and financial backing. This cemented Hussein’s power at home, allowing him to crush the many internal rebellions that erupted occasionally, sometimes with poison gas. It also gave him all the military might he needed to conduct further adventurism — in Kuwait, for example. -Global Research 1991: The Fall of the Soviet Union — The CIA fails to predict this most important event of the Cold War. This suggests that it has been so busy undermining governments that it hasn’t been doing its primary job: gathering and analyzing information. The fall of the Soviet Union also robs the CIA of its reason for existence: fighting communism. This leads some to accuse the CIA of intentionally failing to predict the downfall of the Soviet Union. Curiously, the intelligence community’s budget is not significantly reduced after the demise of communism. -Global Research 1992: Economic Espionage — In the years following the end of the Cold War, the CIA is increasingly used for economic espionage. This involves stealing the technological secrets of competing foreign companies and giving them to American ones. Given the CIA’s clear preference for dirty tricks over mere information gathering, the possibility of serious criminal behavior is very great indeed. -Global Research 1993: Haiti — The chaos in Haiti grows so bad that President Clinton has no choice but to remove the Haitian military dictator, Raoul Cedras, on the threat of U.S. invasion. The U.S. occupiers do not arrest Haiti’s military leaders for crimes against humanity but instead ensure their safety and rich retirements. Aristide is returned to power only after being forced to accept an agenda favorable to the country’s ruling class. -concisepolitics.com 1996: Sudan – The CIA sends $20 million to the Sudanese opposition through Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda to destabilize the government in an attempt to get them to cooperate with the US on investigations and expel Osama Bin Laden and 300 of his associates. The Sudanese argued that this was a huge mistake because while in Sudan, they monitored him and his associates, read their mail, and tracked them. Exactly as predicted (and likely the CIA goal) once Bin Laden and co. left Sudan and hid out in Afghanistan they couldn’t be tracked anywhere. -concisepolitics.com 1996: Iraq – The CIA decided to use the occasion of UN weapon inspectors entering Iraq to try to stage a coup to remove Saddam Hussein. Before the coup could make much headway, it was discovered by Hussein’s intelligence agency, the Mukhabarat, who arrested all of the CIA coup assets, then called the CIA’s secret line used by the coup to tell them that the game was up. The CIA pulled out of the weapon’s inspection and hid any trace of their involvement. -concisepolitics.com 1998: A Tangled Web: A History of CIA Complicity in Drug International Trafficking -U.S. Congressional Record, House of Representatives - May 07, 1998 21st C.: CIA sponsored. Numerous experiments which are performed on human test subjects in the United States are considered unethical, because they are performed without the knowledge or informed consent of the test subjects. Such tests have been performed throughout American history, but some of them are ongoing.[citation needed] The experiments include the exposure of humans to many chemical and biological weapons (including infections with deadly or debilitating diseases), human radiation experiments, injections of toxic and radioactive chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation and torture experiments, tests which involve mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of other experiments. Many of these tests are performed on children,[1] the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of \"medical treatment.\" In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners. Many of these experiments violated US law. Some others were sponsored by government agencies or rogue elements thereof, including the Centers for Disease Control, the United States military, and the Central Intelligence Agency, or they were sponsored by private corporations which were involved in military activities. -Wikipedia 2002: Venezuela – After Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez denounced the US invasion of Afghanistan as terror, the US recalled its ambassador to Venezuela and sent Charles Shapiro as the new ambassador. Shapiro had extensive experience with coups in his capacity in Chile and El Salvador. CIA-front NGO NED (National Endowment for Democracy) was sent to Venezuela and began channeling the first hundred of thousands and millions of dollars to establish and build opposition to Chavez. Meanwhile, the US ambassador groomed Pedro Carmona, the head of Venezuela’s Chamber of Commerce, as the new President. A staged demonstration was used to have the military take Chavez into custody and put Carmona in place as president, but a widespread revolt by the people demanded that Chavez be reinstated, which he was. -concisepolitics.com 2003: Iraq – After the US military invades Iraq on false pretenses, the CIA recruits 27 brigades of “Special Police,” merging the most brutal of Saddam’s security forces with the Iranian-trained Badr militia to form death squads that murdered tens of thousands of mostly Sunni Arab men and boys in Baghdad and elsewhere in a reign of terror that continues to this day. -concisepolitics.com 2004: Ukraine – In an attempt to continue to turn former Soviet states into NATO strongholds, the CIA launched a campaign to oust the president of Ukraine and install a US puppet. CIA-controlled NGO USAID and CIA -compliant NGOs Freedom House and Soros’ Open Society flooded Ukraine with money to establish and grow opposition to the current president. The CIA has been said to have spent $14 million to get a color revolution going to oust the pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and put in his place CIA-puppet Viktor Yushchenko. As soon as the people of Ukraine could vote again in 2010, they resoundingly got rid of the US puppet and returned Yanukovych to power. -concisepolitics.com 2004: Haiti – Former president Aristide is allowed to take over Haiti only after agreeing to demands by the CIA. After eventually deciding that President Aristide would not play ball, the CIA trained what they called “Haitian rebel forces” just over the border in the Dominican Republic. These troops were later used to invade Haiti and depose Aristide. -inteltoday.org 2005: Iran – President Bush authorizes the CIA to undertake black operations to destabilize the Iranian government. Over the next few years $215 million was allocated to this project, much of it spent on dissident groups and radicals. The nature of this changed when it was decided to instead take out Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility to dissuade Israel from attacking it with nuclear weapons. A joint CIA/Israeli team worked on a plan to insert viral code into the Iranian computers that controlled the centrifuges. This virus would eventually become known as the Stuxnet virus. -inteltoday.org 2006: Somalia – After the collapse of the Somali government in 1991 the country fell into chaos. As a result, a system of Sharia law-based courts became the main judicial system. Funded through litigant fees, it eventually offered citizens services such as education and healthcare and acted as the local police force. It was so successful that these courts joined to form the Islamic Courts Union. A successful Islamic government could not be allowed by the CIA in the era of the War on Terror, so the CIA funded secular warlords to create an opposition called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. By claiming that the arms flooding the country by the CIA for their secular group were instead intended for the Islamic Courts Union, the CIA was able to get the Ethiopian military to attack Somalia and begin the devastating War in Somalia. Most of the CIA's actions were run from their station house in Nairobi, Kenya. -inteltoday.org 2009: Honduras – The CIA sponsors a coup d’etat to oust the left-leaning President Manuel Zalaya. The military junta running things behind the scenes conducts severe repression, using death squads to murder political opponents, union organizers, and journalists. -inteltoday.org 2011: Libya – Since he came to power in 1969, the CIA has tried at least four times to overthrow or otherwise remove Muammar Gadhafi, several of which were in partnership with the Israeli Mossad. Numerous acts of terrorism were committed by the CIA and Mossad and blamed on Gadhafi and Libya. Two events pushed the CIA to finally destroy Libya: first, Gadhafi stated that he would find other places to sell Libya’s oil and cut off the US and Europe. The US and Europe are highly dependent on the high-quality “sweet” oil that is extremely low in sulfur, only found in Libya (European refineries cannot process higher sulfur crude oil). Second, Gadhafi announced that he was launching a currency for all of Africa called the Gold Dinar. This currency would be backed by Libya with gold and would be the currency for the continent. As a result, Gadhafi would no longer sell Libyan oil in US dollars. So the standard ops were set in motion: CIA covers NGOs NED and USAID began setting up and funding opposition to Gadhafi in Libya. The Libyan people proved so loyal to Gadhafi that the CIA was forced to bring Al Qaeda forces and claim they were Libyan rebels. Once this fake uprising was implemented, the US claimed that Gadhafi was killing 100-of-thousands of his people – while providing zero proof. They then used NATO and UN forces to completely destroy the billions of dollars in infrastructure that Gadhafi had put in place for the Libyan people, eventually having the CIA agents tell the Al Qaeda rebels where to find Gadhafi, and they then killed him. -inteltoday.org 2012: Syria – The CIA began covertly funding a Syrian opposition as early as 2006. But it was with the fall of Libya that the project went into overdrive. The CIA took the weapons, many of them into Libya, and moved them into terrorist groups in Syria. Classified documents show that even after being warned that funding terrorist groups would lead to the formation of ISIS/ISIL, the response was that it would be a “strategic advantage” over the Assad government and drag it into a proxy war. The ultimate goal was to support a plan from Israel to break Syria and Iraq into smaller ethnic states: the ISIS/ISIL group would form Sunnistan, and the Kurds would form Kurdistan, with others to follow after these were established. It is estimated that as many as 100,000 Syrian soldiers have died fighting this CIA proxy. It has only been the requested intervention of the Russian government that stopped Syria from succumbing to Libya's fate. -inteltoday.org 2013: Venezuela – With the death of Hugo Chavez of cancer (the 5th leader of a South American country opposed to the US to suffer from cancer within 5 years), the CIA saw its opportunity to finally destabilize Venezuela. In the run-up to the election one month following Chavez’s death, the main candidates were Nicolas Maduro (Chavez’s hand-picked successor) and Henrique Capriles (the right-wing candidate). The CIA closely supported, trained and funded Capriles in the hopes of his winning, but even if he didn’t, he would act as a destabilizing force for Venezuela. The initial plan had been for a tight, acrimonious campaign with calls from Capriles of vote tampering/rigging, etc. The CIA planned to assassinate Capriles so the Maduro campaign would get the blame, throwing the country into chaos. The Maduro administration found out about the plot and announced it to the press, to gales of shocked denial by the US. Once Maduro won the election, Capriles began a campaign of accusations and calls for international support. The CIA has used old friends NED and USAID to stage the usual group of students and others as opposition to destabilize the government of Maduro while the US has been causing havoc with Venezuela’s economy. -inteltoday.org 2014: Ukraine – The CIA staged another coup in Ukraine for the second time in 10 years. Using almost exactly the same model, NGOs were brought in to fund an opposition, it has been claimed that the US spent $5 billion on this coup. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, was also a prominent funder of the coup. Staged violence was also used to try and pin the blame on those loyal to Yanukovych. This time though, the CIA planned to remove most of the pro-Russian votes by creating hostilities with the largely Russian east of Ukraine. The coup leaders fraudulently claimed that the Prime Minister was no longer in charge and seized power. Yanukovich fled to Russia, and the CIA and its new puppet regime began a civil war with the Russian sympathetic east Ukrainians. -inteltoday.org 2015: Venezuela – The CIA again tried to stage a coup in Venezuela, this time to take down Chavez’s successor, President Nicolas Maduro. The CIA's plan had been to use NGOs again to incite unrest in the streets and overthrow the elected government with a campaign of violence, including mass killings and tactical bombings of strategic sites across Caracas. When the dust cleared, the coup plotters expected key government officials, including Maduro, to have been assassinated, with the country then firmly in their control. Unfortunately for the CIA, the Maduro government found out, arrested all the coup leaders, revealed the US embassy coordination, and revealed all to the media. -inteltoday.org 2016: Brazil – After the 2010 election and 2014 re-election of left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff, the NSA, and CIA worked together to oust her from power, the final straw being Brazil’s involvement in BRICS (the monetary organization of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Using the wildly corrupt Brazilian congress the NSA and CIA provided collected info to allow the Senate and Lower House to fraudulently impeach her. Temer, her replacement, is widely hated, rampantly corrupt, and a CIA proxy. He is expected to start privatizing much of Brazil’s natural resources. -inteltoday.org 2016: South Africa – Once South Africa joined the BRICS economic group, the CIA began its usual destabilization games. CIA-controlled NGOs were brought in to create and grow opposition to President Jacob Zuma, which recently took the form of Student Protests over fees. -inteltoday.org 2022: Declassified documents reveal CIA has been sweeping up information on Americans -The Guardian The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been secretly collecting Americans’ private information in bulk, according to newly declassified documents that prompted condemnation from civil liberties watchdogs. 2022: Hunter Biden Laptop Scandal Is the Ultimate American Information Operation -Newsweek How did Hunter Biden's depraved behavior and his and his family members' dubious dealings with adversaries and oligarchs compromise and corrupt Joe Biden? What did Joe know, when did he know it and did he directly or indirectly profit? To what extent would—and today, does—the Biden family's conduct loom over vital issues of American foreign policy, and thus national security? We were deprived of the answers to these critical questions during the 2020 election—deprived of hearing the questions asked themselves—because of one of the gravest American information operations in history, masquerading as a defense against a Russian information operation. Now, our Ruling Class' chief organ has admitted it. It took 17 months, and 24 paragraphs into an article at first glance unrelated, but buried in a New York Times report on the apparently sprawling federal investigation into Hunter Biden, the \"Paper of Record\" revealed the truth we've long known: Hunter's \"laptop from hell\" is real. 2022: Latest Twitter Files shows CIA, FBI have spent years meddling in content moderation -New York Post The CIA has been meddling in Twitter’s internal content moderation for years, according to the latest dispatches from Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files” — which also revealed “mountains of insistent moderation demands” from the Democratic National Committee, but not from the GOP. Two separate threads in the ongoing Elon Musk-sponsored deep dive into the social media’s internal documents were released Saturday by independent journalist Matt Taibbi, documenting how the platform has frequently bowed to government and political pressure. 2023: Records Detail CIA’s Efforts to Bury Sexual Misconduct Claims -The Intercept In the intelligence community, victims of sexual harassment face a constant concern of the agency revoking their security clearance or abandoning them,” Kristin Alden, a prominent Washington, D.C., employment lawyer who represents intelligence community workers in discrimination and harassment cases, told The Intercept. “These are mostly women — they are overseas, they are undercover, they are not using their real names, they are alone and isolated and don’t have family or friends with them.

    "title": "Can tigers be truly domesticated to the point they don t attack humans",
    "answers": {
      "1": "They can be somewhat domesticated but you’ll never be able to fully domesticate them. Their instincts will always be there just like any cat. The difference is a normal can generally can’t kill you with one bite or scratch.\nIf you don’t want to take my word for it then I’ll tell you the exact same thing I was told by a woman who worked at a wildcat sanctuary. She had been working there for fifteen years and had watched some of them grow from cubs to adults. They knew her and they had seen her almost every day since they had arrived at the sanctuary and some she had been there for their birth. She had helped raised quite a few of them but even she said you can never truly trust them.\nOne person on the tour kept trying to say that they were just pretty cats, they meant no harm, and they only wanted to play and never intended to hurt anyone. She shut him down at every turn and constantly had to pull him away from being too close to the fences when the tigers and lions were too close. She loved them but she also knew they have centuries of honed instincts in them that could never be overridden.\nYes they’re beautiful and yes they were more docile near humans than most wild cats but they still have strong instincts to kill. They’re predators. That’s what they do. It doesn’t mean they’re terrible creatures, it just means they know their place in the food chain and they know that if there’s an unprotected human they’re higher up on the food chain.",
      "2": "No. Even if raised from cubhood, like any feline (just watch a cat attack a lure) they will instinctively jump on anything that runs away. The difference with a cat is that a tiger is capable of killing with a single strike.\nEven dogs still have that reflex to go after a fleeing human and they have been domesticated for a very long time.",
      "3": "Can tigers be truly domesticated to the point they don’t attack humans?\nMy cat tries to kill me twice a day while playing with me.\nA tiger would succeed.",
      "4": "Even domesticated animals attack humans. Horses and cows kill more people than sharks. Dogs attack more people than crocodiles (though it’s usually diseases that kill dog attack victims, not the actual injury). A domesticated tiger would still be a potentially deadly animal based on size alone, and nothing will stop a tiger from being carnivorous. Which means the teeth and claws could still be lethal weapons.",
      "5": "Please define “attack”\nIf you are referring to “teach angry Tiger you are not food but a member of his family” …. Sure this can be done hence why you see zoo keepers in the cage with the big cat, side by side to educate the public. A lot of hours go into teaching the cat you are part of his family and not food, and generally attacks of this nature are rare in a zoo setting cause the big cat is well fed…\nThat being said\nIf you are referring to domesticating a big cat so much there is 0.00 chance of it ever causing you harm. No this is not possible. Spend 30 years with a tiger cub. It will think you are family…we often play with our family members. For a cub that is programed to hunt down pray its a survival training even if its never “to kill or maim brothers or sister cubs” Humans do it too growing up, we play fight….would do alot more of it if our survival depended on how good we could tackle our brothers …Ofcouse for a baby tiger cub it's cute….like a domesticated pussy-cat pouncing on you or playing with “the ball with you.”\nsame animal a few years older….weighing in at 400kg who in a matter of seconds can do a human serious damage just by a playful fun filled smack of his “unclawed” paw. Yeah nope.\nThey don't have to see you as pray to do damage.\nAnd the only way you will ever get a tiger of any age to not “play rough” is to make it into a vegetarian….and then spend approx. 300 years training him and his descendants…..good luck",

Beautiful and majestic, even when raised from cubs, the have the predictable potential to behave like what they are, wild animals. Theres that inherent behavior they cannot control, they're not supposed. Feeding and petting wont change that.\nOn occasion there are those who force tigers and lions into “pethood” by deforming them, removing teeth and claws. When owners face the ongoing costs associated with feeding and keeping, they sell them where they are shot for sport, or sold; zoos typically wont buy them.

      "7": "Let’s rewind this for a minute. Can house cats be truly domesticated to the point they don’t attack humans? I don’t think so. House cats have been with us for about four thousand years, and they still randomly bite the shit out of us. Even the sweetest of cat will sometimes just get in a crazy look in its eye and attack. This is how the cat do.",
      "8": "Ayy yo? You serious right now?\nHell naw boy, they can’t be! Tigers are wild animals and first of all they should not be pet by any foolish curious guy. They’re not like your house cats. They are TIGERS.\nThey are aggressive by nature! Even though anyone succeeded to pet them there’s no telling when we’ll found his/her dead body in backyard!\nLEAVE THEM ALONE!!",
      "9": "Domestication of an animal species takes many, many generations. We’ve done it with dogs and cats and with farm animals. The problem with domesticating a big carnivore like a tiger is that humans, although they are not usual prey for tigers, are something that they can easily kill and eat. Even domestic cats bite or claw their owners sometimes, even though we are clearly not their prey. Those injuries are painful but not really dangerous unless they get infected. I have some small scars on my hand that a cat inflicted about 25 years ago. Imagine a tiger doing the same thing!",
      "10": "First off, domestication is different from taming. You can tame a tiger so that it is less likely to attack humans, but you can’t eliminate it altogether. Domestication is selecting for particular traits via controlled breeding. Thus to domesticate a tiger you’d need to breed a population of them to be docile and friendly and there are a few problems with this approach.\nFirst off, you’d have to feed them, which will be expensive given their size and carnivorous diet.\nSecond, you’d need to be able to keep them confined in cages, further adding to the cost.\nThird, you’d have to be able to control who mates with whom, so only the most docile pass on their genes to the next generation. And how do you decide which is the most docile? Tigers are not exactly predictable. And you’d need a large population to avoid inbreeding, and docility is a rare trait in tigers, so how many generations will it take to breed that trait into the majority of the tigers?\nAll in all it’s possible to domesticate tigers, but not a tiger, and not in a single lifetime or on a budget.",
      "11": "No, tigers are not truly domesticated, despite being raised in captivity for generations.\nWhile individual tigers may become habituated to humans, they still retain their wild instincts and behaviors, making it unsafe to assume that they will never attack humans.\nAs apex predators with powerful jaws and sharp claws, tigers command respect and caution, and interacting with them always requires appropriate safety measures.",
      "12": "Not a single carnivore has been domesticated to the point that it won’t attack humans; not housecats, not your raven, and not your schnauzer either.\nYou can form a strong bond with them that is not unlike the relationship you’d have with your housecat, but the two differences are:\nWhen your house cat gets mad at you, it’s not able to kill you; hell, it can barely hurt you. The tiger can and will.\nTrue domestication is a multi-generational process; at least 6 - 10 of them. To put that in perspective, a healthy tiger can live up to 30 years; that’s up to, at worst, 300 years before domestication.\nThe other thing is, we don’t want these animals domesticated. Yes, bears, lions tigers and so on are beautiful creatures, but the problem is they are very big and very strong creatures with very sharp teeth and claws. There’s a reason why the largest domestic animals are purely herbivores. A horse’s kick will break your ribs. A tiger’s bite will sever a limb.",
      "13": "There’s a world of difference between taming and domestication. An animal isn’t domesticated until its behavior has been so thoroughly modified through breeding that a human can at least fairly reliably predict and control its actions. Taming is the process of forming a bond with a wild animal from a young age so that you can have at least some control over it.\nThe difference is that the animal is still wild. It still has deeply seeded instincts that behavioral training will never touch, and that must be worked around carefully to maintain safety.\nIf you’re referring to domestication by its dictionary definition, potentially with a few hundred years of concerted effort, though what you’re left with by the end almost certainly won’t be recognizable as a tiger. If you’re referring to taming, absolutely not. behavioral modification through training doesn’t run nearly deep enough to remove an apex predator’s violent tendencies.",
      "14": "A tiger is a apex predator and has centuries of instinct for hunting.\nEven if a cub is raised from infancy and it becomes familiar with the person who looks after him, it is not safe.\nThe very size of tiger has potential of killing s person even if the intention to kill is not present.\nThis can be seen in dogs also, centuries of human contact has subdued their hunting instinct but if the animal is startled or is sleeping, the natural instinct takes over.\nOur dog was a adorable creature but if you disturbed it while sleeping, it’s instinctive reaction was to lash out, however it soon controlled itself as it became awake and more in control of itself.\nNow just image a sleeping tiger getting startled in this fashion, a mere swip of its paws will kill a human being even before the tiger is awake .\nAlso a tiger does not live in groups, it is a solitary animal except a mother with her child.\nAnimals which do not live in groups are normally hard to domesticate",
      "15": "No, like most wild animals, they could always turn on you. They tried to domesticate wolves, they eventually ripped up the house. Sure, now we have dogs, but it took a long time to do it. Maybe if you did that with tigers, after MANY generations, it might work. This is why you need permits and training to own one legally.",

      "17": "It might be possible to raise a tiger from a cub and train it to the point it would be UNLIKELY to attack a person, but there’s no way to guarantee that result.\nIt’s impossible to domesticate any species of animal in a generation, or even a few generations.\nWild animals such as tigers and elephants can be TAMED, to some extent, possibly even to the extent they are peaceable and will work all day. Elephants can be trained this way. Tigers can be trained at least to the point that a very skillful trainer, one with more balls than brains, can use them in a circus show, but such tigers are still wild animals.\nDomesticating tigers would take many many generations, maybe hundreds of generations, and it might not even be possible, in the end.\nAnd in the end, the final generation might still look more or less the same, but it wouldn’t be the same anymore. Such a tiger would lack the behaviors and instincts necessary to live in the wild.",
      "18": "ANSWER: Well it is possible but very difficult given the time and resources it takes to accomplish it. If you can find out a way to increase their serotonin levels with selective-breeding for Tigers, you may be able to domesticate (more like “tame”) them.\nThe results of selective-breeding perhaps can be accelerated with the skillful introduction of plant-protein in the species’ diet. There are numerous cases of lions that were raised on grain diets who would not even touch meat. It is also interesting to note that when lions make a kill, they prefer to first eat the rumen, which is that part of the animal that contains fermented plant products, then they eat the meat.\n//Image: From 1946 to 1955, an African lioness by the name of “Little Tyke”, who was born and raised in America and owned by Georges and Margaret Westbeau, lived her entire life of nine years without ever eating meat. This unusual case alarmed many scientists who were steadfast in their reports that carnivorous animals cannot live without meat. The owners went to great lengths to try to coax their unusual pet to develop a taste for meat but failed even by offering a large money reward (~$10,000 in today’s terms) to anyone who could coax the lioness to eat meat, but no one ever succeeded.\nIt is known that selective breeding can tame the most vicious of killers, out of the same gene pool, in any species because aggressive natures have a genetic basis and can be reduced quickly through selective breeding.\nFor example, a Russian scientist by the name of Dmitry Belyaev (and others) who was the Director of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1959-1985), studied the process of domesticating foxes and found out that the changes in behavior (especially aggression) could be selected for quickly (L. Trut, \"Early canid domestication: the farm-fox experiment,\" American Scientist 87 (1999): 160-169.)\n//Image: Dmitry Belyaev handling foxes.\n\nFrom a variety of foxes, selected those that responded without fear to humans and the fearful ones were discarded in the experiment. By the sixth generation of selective breeding, the foxes displayed behavioral patterns that were similar to a typical house dog such as whimpering to attract attention and licking their owners.\nAccording to their studies, by the tenth generation, this behavior increased to one pup in six. By the 30th generation, it was three pups in four.\nNot only were these changes accompanied by changes in behavior, but these changes also included anatomical changes and increases in serotonin levels.\n[Source: Professor Walter J. Veith, PhD Zoology, “Rapid Transformation”]\nJust for fun, here are some adorable foxes:",
      "19": "I suppose it depends on what you mean by “domesticated”.\nHousecats choose to be “domesticated”.\nOr not.\nThey don’t attack humans by default, but neither do tigers.\nNow, have you ever been attacked by a housecat?\nHave you ever watched or experienced a cat going bull-balls-berserk?\nYou are dominant over it only because you can physically overpower it.\nThat cat is not as strong as you, but it can put you in intensive care for a week.\nAnd chooses not to.\nPretty likely it knows that if it can kill you, it’s got fresh meat for a week.\nBut cats prefer rodents and the ones that choose to domesticate themselves have proven useful and pleasant company.\nThe dynamics change a little when the cat outweighs you by a factor of three or four, and doesn’t have 10,000 generations of hanging out with humans in its lineage.\nMost tigers can probably be “tamed” with the right incentives.\nYou might be able to “domesticate” a few individuals with mellower dispositions.\nHousecats DO attack humans, and why would you expect more from a tiger than a housecat?",

If you had a really nice tiger, but snuck up on them and surprised them, or grabbed them in a way they didn’t like, that tiny brain might just say ‘danger’ and then you get badly hurt.\nThe stories of people getting hurt or killed by big cats that had a history of being ‘tame’ is long.\nI love cats, but even if there was a tame tiger and someone was telling me to get on the floor with it for a hug or play, I’d be very unlikely to do it.",

They are less aggressive and strong yet they attack humans and some animals sometimes. And the amazing part is that, they have been domesticated for years. They tend to run after whatever they see running.\nHowever, it is possible for one or two people to domesticate a few of tigers without attacking them later, maybe when they are grown up. These tigers may attack other people when they feel threatened.\nThere are cases in Asia where tigers are used as pets. They do not attack people. And sometimes, they're featured in movies.

This was a test to find out if personality was genetic - which also goes in line with certain cat breeds having personalities. Feral cats also tend to form groups while their ancestors were territorial.\nAssuming it would work with a tiger, but you might have a better chance with a lion considering it is already a social animal. Foxes are already social as well.\nTigers are more of independent hunters, so I am sure domestication would take longer.

      "3": "Evidence!!\nIf the law/theory is well established, you’ll need very firm evidence and lots of it, preferably in the form of independent testing by other scientists, and withstanding a ruthless attack on your experimental methods with the aim of finding experimental errors. Only if your evidence can stand up to all of this will the scientific community start to think in terms of revising the theory.\nA classic example is the creationist wet dream of overturning evolution by finding fossilised rabbits in Cambrian age rocks. That would indeed be revolutionary, because it would overturn so much of what we think we know about geology and the evolutionary history of life on Earth.\nThat is precisely why scientists would be so sceptical. They would look for other explanations such as mis-identification, contamination, and even outright fraud, before accepting your conclusions.\nAnd that is entirely justified - it is how science avoids chasing every hair-brained notion up blind alleys, and ensures that scarce research resources are allocated to what are likely to be the most promising projects.",
      "4": "In science, the terms \"law\" and \"theory\" have distinct meanings and roles, and they are subject to different standards of validation and potential for revision or disproval.\nScientific Laws: Scientific laws are descriptions of observable phenomena that hold true under specific conditions. They are often mathematical relationships, like Newton's laws of motion or the law of conservation of energy. These laws are based on extensive empirical evidence and are considered to be highly reliable within the scope of their application. However, scientific laws are not considered to be absolute truths; rather, they are generalizations that hold under specific conditions. It is possible for scientific laws to be revised or extended when new evidence or observations reveal exceptions or limitations to their applicability. For example, Newton's laws of motion work well for objects moving at everyday speeds but break down at very high speeds or in strong gravitational fields, as demonstrated by Einstein's theory of relativity.\nScientific Theories: Scientific theories are comprehensive explanations of natural phenomena that are supported by a large body of evidence from various sources, including experiments and observations. Theories are more overarching and explanatory than laws. They provide a framework for understanding a wide range of related phenomena. Theories are not considered absolute truths either and are always subject to revision or even replacement when new evidence emerges. However, the threshold for revising or disproving a well-established scientific theory is typically quite high. It requires substantial and compelling contradictory evidence and the proposal of a new theory that better explains the observed phenomena.\nIn summary, scientific laws and theories can be revised or expanded based on new evidence and observations, but they are not easily disproven. Disproofing a scientific theory or law usually requires the accumulation of substantial contrary evidence and the development of a better alternative explanation that accounts for the observed phenomena more accurately. Science is a self-correcting process, and the revision of scientific ideas in response to new evidence is a fundamental aspect of its progress.\nScientific Laws: Revisions and Extensions: Scientific laws can be revised or extended when new evidence or observations reveal exceptions or limitations to their applicability. For instance, when scientists discovered the phenomenon of quantum mechanics, it introduced a new framework for understanding the behavior of particles at very small scales, which was not covered by classical physics laws.\nContextual Limitations: Many scientific laws are context-dependent. They may work well under specific conditions but break down or require modification under different circumstances. For example, the ideal gas law approximates the behavior of gases under certain conditions but becomes less accurate at extreme temperatures and pressures.\nScientific Theories: Revisions and Refinements: Scientific theories are subject to continuous refinement and development as new data becomes available. For instance, the theory of evolution by natural selection has evolved over time as our understanding of genetics and molecular biology has advanced. This has led to refinements in the theory to account for new evidence.\nFalsifiability: One of the key principles of science is the concept of falsifiability, which means that scientific theories must be formulated in a way that allows them to be potentially disproven by evidence. If a theory makes predictions that do not match observations or experiments, it can be subject to revision or even rejection.\nCompeting Theories: Sometimes, scientific theories face challenges from competing theories. For example, in the realm of cosmology, there have been debates and ongoing research to refine and choose between competing theories about the structure and history of the universe, such as the Big Bang theory and alternative models.\nInterconnectedness: Scientific theories are often interconnected. A modification or disproof of one theory can have implications for other related theories. For example, if new evidence were to disprove the theory of relativity, it would likely impact our understanding of many aspects of physics and cosmology.\nEmpirical Evidence: Scientific laws and theories are grounded in empirical evidence, which includes data collected through experiments, observations, and measurements. When new and more accurate data becomes available, it can challenge or refine existing scientific ideas. For example, advancements in telescope technology have allowed astronomers to collect more precise data about the universe, leading to refinements in our understanding of celestial mechanics. Advances in measurement techniques can also lead to revisions. The redefinition of the meter in terms of the speed of light or the kilogram in terms of Planck's constant are examples of how scientific standards are updated to account for improved measurement capabilities.\nExperimental Design and Replication: Scientific experiments are designed to test hypotheses and theories. When researchers design experiments that challenge prevailing theories and conduct them rigorously, the results can either provide additional support for the theory or suggest the need for modification. Replication of experiments by independent researchers is crucial for verifying results and ensuring the reliability of scientific conclusions.\nPeer Review: The scientific community relies on peer review to evaluate the validity and quality of research. When a scientist proposes a new idea or challenges an existing theory, it undergoes scrutiny by other experts in the field. Peer review helps to identify flaws, biases, or overlooked variables in research, contributing to the self-correcting nature of science.\nPrediction and Testing: Scientific theories often make predictions about future observations or experiments. These predictions can serve as a crucial test for the validity of a theory. If a theory consistently fails to make accurate predictions, it may need revision or replacement.\nParadigm Shifts: In some cases, scientific revolutions involve paradigm shifts, where entire worldviews and frameworks of understanding are restructured. Examples include the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric model of the solar system and the transition from classical physics to quantum mechanics and relativity. These shifts often require substantial evidence and lead to the replacement of existing theories.\nInterdisciplinary Research: Advances in one scientific discipline can influence and challenge theories in other fields. For instance, developments in genetics and neuroscience have led to revisions in theories related to human evolution and behavior.\nPhilosophical and Ethical Considerations: Philosophical and ethical debates can also influence scientific theories. Issues such as ethics in medical research, the nature of consciousness, and the implications of artificial intelligence can prompt scientists to reconsider and revise existing theories in light of new moral and philosophical insights.\nSocietal and Technological Factors: Societal and technological changes can lead to new avenues of research and data collection. For example, the development of the internet and computational tools has enabled researchers to analyze vast datasets, leading to discoveries and refinements in various scientific fields.\nIn conclusion, the process of revising or potentially disproving scientific laws and theories is multifaceted and dynamic. It involves ongoing data collection, experimentation, peer review, and openness to new ideas and evidence. Science is a dynamic and evolving endeavor, and its ability to adapt and refine its understanding of the natural world is one of its greatest strengths.",
